Causal decompositions are circuit\ndecompositions in which, more generally, multiple such no-influence conditions\nare made apparent simultaneously.

This\nsurvey provides a systematic review of how Qiskit has evolved and what it has\ncontributed to several critical fields including cryptography and\ncybersecurity, image and signal processing, climate science and energy\napplications, and finance. We show how Qiskit facilitates hybrid\nclassical-quantum workflows and enables the deployment of algorithms on\nphysical quantum hardware through error mitigation and modular integration\napproaches. Our exploration covers several key applications, including quantum\nkey distribution, climate simulation, and quantum-enhanced portfolio\noptimization, while providing practical insights into their implementation.\nThis work also covers the framework's technical structure and current\nlimitations associated with scalability and reproducibility.
