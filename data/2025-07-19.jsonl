The energy is injected into the system by periodically modulating\nthe trapping potential of a spherical unitary Fermi gas, and due to the\nexistence of SO(2,1) symmetry, the breathing mode is excited without\ndissipation. Through the long-lived breathing oscillation, we precisely measure\nthe energy evolution of the nonequilibrium system during the trap modulation.\nWe find the trapping potential and internal energies increase with modulation\ntime and simultaneously oscillate nearly $\\textrm{180}^{\\textrm{o}}$ out of\nphase. At large modulation amplitudes, the energy-injection efficiency is\nstrongly reduced due to the trap anharmonicity. Unlike the equilibrium system,\nthe measured energy evolution agrees well with predictions of the dynamic\nvirial theorem. Our work provides valuable insights into the energy injection\nand redistribution in a non-equilibrium system, paving a way for future\ninvestigations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics."}

However, a major limitation of it is that its computational\ncost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we\npropose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key\ninsight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few\nimpurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest\nflavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is\nparticularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal\nhybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent\nbath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the\naccuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of\nimpurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and\nbenchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations.\nOur method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve\nlarge-scale quantum impurity problems."}
