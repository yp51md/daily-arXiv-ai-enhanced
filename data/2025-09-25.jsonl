The recently discovered hexagonal altermagnet manganese telluride\n($\\alpha$-MnTe) is a prime example. It has a compensated $A$-type\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state where the in-plane ferromagnetic (FM)\nmoments in each layer are stacked antiferromagnetically along the $c$ axis, yet\nexhibits a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that breaks the $T$-symmetry\nwith a vanishingly small $c$-axis FM moment. However, the presence of three\n120$^\\circ$ separated in-plane magnetic domains presents a challenge in\nunderstanding the origin of AHE and the effective control of the altermagnetic\nstate. Here we use neutron scattering to show that a compressive uniaxial\nstrain along the next-nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn bond direction detwins\n$\\alpha$-MnTe into a single in-plane magnetic domain, aligning the in-plane\nmoments along the same direction. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial strain\n(-0.2% to 0.1%) significantly sharpens the magnetic hysteresis loop and\nswitches the sign of the AHE near room temperature. Remarkably, this is\nachieved without altering the AFM phase-transition temperature, which can only\nbe explained by a strain-induced modification of the electronic band structure.\nOur work not only unambiguously establishes the relationship between the\nin-plane moment direction and the AHE in $\\alpha$-MnTe but also paves the way\nfor future applications in highly scalable, strain-tunable magnetic sensors and\nspintronic devices."}

The interplay of dynamical correlation\neffects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a\nwide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band\ndegeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent\nmaximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully\nreproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy\nresults alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy\nof local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy\nmeasurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the\nstronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the\nelectron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and\nstability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping. Our\nresults show that even fine-level structures in the experimental data can now\nbe faithfully reproduced and understood."}

We study the dynamical process of\nscattering of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of Gaussian\nwavepackets from skyrmions with the aid of the non-relativistic time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. The scattering cross section shows a rich angular\ndependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the\nspin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial\noutcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities\nirrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts\nassociated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound\nstate at the scattering center. In addition to the rich and intriguing physics,\nthe numerical recipe developed here can be easily adopted for any arbitrary\nspin texture, which will prepare a playground to explore tunable spin\ntransport."}

However, the stability\ndiagrams that allow the identification of the desired charge states are long to\nacquire. Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state\nincreases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability\ndiagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor.\nCurrently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach\nshows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in\nthe number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an\nautotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by\nharnessing the FPGA embedded in Keysight's Quantum Engineering Toolkit (QET),\nthe measurement time of stability diagrams has been reduced by a factor of 9.8.\nThis led to an acceleration factor of 2.2 for the total initialization time of\na SiGe quantum dot into the single-electron regime, which is limited by the\nPython code execution."}

In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely\nrelated to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT,\nparticularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a\nholographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the\nouter edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its\nfixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's\nfunction in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter\nspace, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's\nfunction and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge\nof the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's\nfunction. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard\nmodel, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition\nin the deep interior."}

In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder -\nan experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to\nexplore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures\nderived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales.\nWe begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the\nsystem begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the\nRMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local\nexcitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the\nlinear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical\nresults confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and\nupper bounds the Thouless times.

We\nfind that geometric frustration suppresses the critical interaction strength\nfor the (chiral-)superfluid to Mott insulator ($\\chi$-SF-MI) quantum phase\ntransition by a factor of 2.7(3) and furthermore changes the critical dynamics\nof the transition. Although the emergence of coherence during fast ramps from\nMI to the ($\\chi$-)SF regime is continuous in both cases, for ramps longer than\na few tunnelling times, significant differences emerge. In the \\frs case, no\nlong-range order emerges on the studied timescales, highlighting a\nsignificantly reduced rate or even saturation of the emerging coherence.
