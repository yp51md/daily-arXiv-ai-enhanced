To provide new insight, we investigate the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid in the very-low temperature regime, by using a replicated version of the refined HMSA theory of the liquid state, combined with an appropriate split of the pair potential [Bomont and Bretonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4141 (2001)]. Our scheme allows one to reach an unprecedented low-temperature domain within both the supercooled liquid and the ideal-glass phase. Therein, a density-dependent temperature is identified, whereupon the radial distribution function experiences clear-cut structural changes, insofar as an additional peak develops in between the main and the second peaks. Such a structural feature points to a local structure of the Lennard-Jones ideal glass with an fcc-like short-range order, in the absence of any long-range order."}

We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $β\\approx1.00$, $δ\\approx0.5$, and $ν_{\\parallel}\\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $β\\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of MF-DP dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to DP. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behaviour in socio-economic and active systems."}

This paper discusses the geometric decomposition of information flow, which was introduced for Markov jump systems [Y Maekawa, R Nagayama, K Yoshimura and S Ito, arXiv:2509.21985 (2025)], and applies it to overdamped Langevin systems. For overdamped Langevin systems, the geometric decomposition of information flow into excess and housekeeping contributions is related to the conventional definition of the $2$-Wasserstein distance between marginal distributions in optimal transport theory. This formulation offers an optimal-transport interpretation of subsystem dynamics, and this optimal-transport formulation is simpler for overdamped Langevin systems than for general Markov jump systems. It is also possible to handle features that are specific to overdamped Langevin systems, such as representations based on the Koopman mode decomposition, as well as their relationship with the Fisher information matrix. As with the results for Markov jump systems, we generalize the second law of information thermodynamics using housekeeping and excess information flow, leading to the concept of excess and housekeeping demons. We also derive a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and an information-thermodynamic speed limit incorporating excess information flow. These results are illustrated for the Gaussian case, and we discuss the conditions under which the excess and housekeeping demons emerge."}

The field dependence of magnetization at low temperatures suggests an antiferromagnetic state undergoing a metamagnetic transition to a ferromagnetic state above the critical field. The observation of large coercivity (unlike other compounds in the RAgAl series) and non-saturation of magnetization indicates a disordered magnetic state having both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. The presence of competing interactions leading to a disordered state is also supported by transport measurements and is attributed presumably to the layered structure of the compound."}

Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures."}

Our approach uncovers a topological phase transition--driven purely by the finite connectivity structure of the network--that leads to multi-stability.

Here, we show that optical excitation of undoped Ta2NiS5 - a correlated quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor - generates a pronounced and long-lived trion population, demonstrating that such states can be dynamically induced even in the absence of doping. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we track the dynamics of a bright, localized in-gap state that emerges following photoexcitation and identify it as a transient trion population. We uncover an unconventional trion formation pathway and a fluence-dependent competition between trions and excitons.

Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits."}

We demonstrate that despite their distinct atomic origins, these orbitals host nearly identical hopping physics and spin-orbit coupling, formalized through an effective ${l=1}$ angular momentum algebra for the $t_{2g}$ case. This equivalence allows one to transpose physical intuition and theoretical models developed for $p$-orbital systems directly onto the more complex $t_{2g}$ materials, and vice versa. We showcase how this paradigm provides a unified understanding of emergent phenomena, including non-trivial band topology, itinerant ferromagnetism, and unconventional superconductivity, across a wide range of platforms, from transition metal compounds, two-dimensional oxide heterostructures, and iron-based superconductors, to $p$-orbital ultracold gases. Ultimately, this $p$-$t_{2g}$ homology serves not only as a tool for interpretation but also as a robust design principle for engineering novel quantum states."}

This framework naturally incorporates strong spatial inhomogeneity and yields the AC conductivity directly from the effective potential. The standard MB result is recovered as a limiting case.

In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement.

Once the minimal structure needed to measure constant -- energy manifolds is made explicit, the microcanonical measure emerges as the natural hypersurface measure on each energy shell. Thermodynamics becomes the study of how these shells deform with energy: the entropy is the logarithm of a geometric area, and its derivatives satisfy a deterministic hierarchy of entropy flow equations driven by microcanonical averages of curvature invariants (built from the shape/Weingarten operator and related geometric data). Within this framework, phase transitions correspond to qualitative reorganizations of the geometry of energy manifolds, leaving systematic signatures in the derivatives of the entropy.\n  Two general structural consequences follow. First, we reveal a thermodynamic covariance: the reconstructed thermodynamics is invariant under arbitrary descriptive choices such as reparametrizations and equivalent representations of the same conserved dynamics. Second, a geometric microcanonical equivalence is found: microscopic realizations that share the same geometric content of their energy manifolds (in the sense of entering the curvature sources of the flow) necessarily yield the same microcanonical thermodynamics. We demonstrate the full practical power of the formalism by reconstructing microcanonical response and identifying criticality across paradigmatic systems, from exactly solvable mean-field models to genuinely nontrivial short-range lattice field theories and the 1D long-range XY model with $1/r^α$ interactions."}

The QPCS framework is particularly relevant to Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory, which postulates extra spatial dimensions to unify electromagnetism and gravity. In KK theory, these extra dimensions are typically hidden and require high-energy conditions for detection. Motivated by the challenge of uncovering these dimensions more feasibly, this research applies a perturbative potential of the form \\hat{H}_{\\text{SL}} = βzV_{o_{z}}(θ) to a QPCS characterized by length \\textit{L} and radius R_{o}. This potential is inspired by the Stark effect in hydrogen atoms, where energy level splitting serves as an indicator of an external influence. The study demonstrates that, for a degenerate configuration (R_{o} = \\frac{L}π), the Stark-like perturbation effectively induces energy level splitting, which can be interpreted as a means of revealing hidden dimensions. The first-order energy correction in this scenario depends explicitly on the quantum numbers n_{z} and n_θ, highlighting the potential for this approach to probe extra-dimensional effects in lower-energy quantum systems."}

However, meeting all of these requirements simultaneously has been difficult with conventional high-k systems. In this work, we demonstrate that Hf/Zr-based gate stacks quantitatively satisfy these conditions. After a 700 C N2 anneal, the HZH superlattice achieves an EOT of 7.3 A, lower than conventional HfO2-only stacks (8.5 A) while maintaining comparable leakage. Embedding a 3 A Al2O3 dipole within an HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2 superlattice (HZHA) breaks the conventional dipole trade-off, achieving an EOT of 8.4 A, lower than the 9.0 A of a standard HfO2/Al2O3 stack, while providing a flatband voltage shift greater than 200 mV, thereby enabling multi-Vth tuning without compromising scaling. Furthermore, under -2 V negative-bias temperature stress at 125 C for 100 s, HZHA and HA exhibit comparable flatband voltage drifts of 87 mV and 97 mV, respectively, confirming that strong Vth tunability and sub-nanometer EOT can be achieved without compromising stability. In addition to these quantitative advances, this study reveals previously unreported physical insights into dipole behavior and interfacial diffusion in ultrathin Hf/Zr multilayers. These results establish HZHA as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier."}

Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures."}

This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths.

We consider a model of two continuum polymerized membranes, separated by a distance $\\ell$, in their flat phase, coupled by interlayer shear, compression/dilatation and elastic terms. Within a controlled truncation of the effective average action, we retain only the contributions that generate a pronounced crossover of the effective bending rigidity along the renormalization group flow between two regimes: at high running scale $k$, the rigidity is dominated by the in-plane elastic properties, with $κ_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\sim \\ell^{2}(λ+2μ)/2$, whereas at low $k$ it is controlled by the bending rigidity of two independent monolayers, $κ_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\sim 2κ$. This crossover is reminiscent of that observed by Mauri et al. as a function of the wavevector scale $q$, but here it is obtained within a renormalization group framework. This has several advantages. First, although approximations are performed, the NPRG approach allows one, in principle, to take into account all nonlinearities present in the elastic theory, in contrast to the SCSA treatment which requires, already at the formal level, significant simplifications. Second, it demonstrates that the bilayer problem can be treated as a straightforward extension of the monolayer case, with flow equations that keep the same structure and differ only by bilayer-specific adjustments. Third, unlike the SCSA, the NPRG framework admits a controlled, systematically improvable, hierarchy of approximations."}

This work introduces a novel theoretical framework based on Quantum Phase Space (QPS) to address the dual challenge of characterizing environment-selected pointer states and modeling decoherence dynamics across different regimes. Within this framework, pointer states for particle motion are identified as the minimum-uncertainty states, those that saturate the quantum uncertainty relation, thereby constituting the closest quantum analogue to classical phase-space points. The structure of the QPS, encoded in a variance-covariance matrix, is shown to be directly shaped by environmental properties. A time-independent matrix corresponds to Markovian (memoryless) decoherence, described by constant diffusion and friction coefficients, while a time-dependent matrix captures non-Markovian dynamics, characterized by environmental memory and information backflow. This unified geometric formalism, applied to both Lindblad and Non-Markovian master equations, enables us to derive explicit relations between environmental parameters and phase-space structure, as demonstrated in a specific illustrative example. This approach has the potential to serve as a powerful tool for modeling decoherence in nanoscience and could inform new principles for designing mitigation strategies and harnessing non-Markovian effects for quantum technologies. The QPS framework may thus bridge fundamental theory and practical quantum engineering, offering a promising coherent pathway to understand, control, and exploit decoherence at the nanoscience frontier."}

However, its detailed response to magnetic fields remains elusive due to the small nuclear magneton of 3He and lack of analogous fermion systems. Here, we show that an electron system also exhibit the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, unlike conventional electron systems where a field melts an electron solid into a metal.

The {\\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE appear to be an ideal tool to study {\\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of physical systems under different localisation and disorder strengths."}

The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force."}

Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei.

In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap Models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We have used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the diamagnetic response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL.

The Lieb--Robinson correlation function can be used to characterize the propagation of quantum information in Ising chains. Considerable work has been done to establish bounds on this correlation function in various circumstances. To actually calculate the value of the correlation function directly typically requires a state space which grows exponentially with system size, and so is intractable for all but relatively small systems. We employ a recently-developed method that enables direct calculation of the value of the Lieb--Robinson correlation function and which scales linearly with system size. This enables the computation for systems with many hundreds of qubits, revealing the propagation of quantum information down the chain. We extend this technique to the problem of Ising chains with randomly disordered coupling strengths.

Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal."}

With the qGAN parameters fixed after training, we evaluate the objective as the expectation value of a problem Hamiltonian and optimize only the QAOA variational parameters. We interpret non-anticipativity as a condition on measurement outcome statistics and prove that the first-stage measurement marginal is independent of the scenario. For uniformly discretized uncertainty, the diagonal operator encoding the uncertainty admits a sparse Pauli-Z expansion via the Walsh--Hadamard transform, yielding polylogarithmic scaling of gate count and circuit depth with the number of scenarios.

Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure.

However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly.

However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly.

This phase is characterized by the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels without a bulk energy gap. Notably, in a six-terminal Hall bar, our calculations show that, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can emerge due to dephasing, despite the Hall resistivity itself never becoming quantized.

For two spatially separated collective modes, we derive an exact entanglement boundary based on the positivity of the partial transpose, valid in the symmetric resonant limit. From this result we obtain an explicit minimum collective fluctuation amplitude, expressed entirely in measurable noise, bandwidth, dissipation, and distance-dependent coupling parameters, required to sustain steady-state entanglement at finite temperature. We further show that large collective occupation suppresses but does not eliminate quantum phase diffusion, so the steady state remains phase symmetric and does not collapse to a classical mean-field despite macroscopic signal amplitudes. Stochastic simulations of the reduced open-system dynamics, together with matched classical correlated-noise null models analyzed through an identical pipeline, confirm that entanglement witnesses are violated only in the quantum regime.

A fascinating concept for such high-speed operation is offered in metallic antiferromagnets by Néel spin-orbit torque. It should allow one to coherently rotate the ordered spins by simply applying an electric current of suitable amplitude and polarity. However, such switching has been severely hampered by competing heat-induced effects, and it has not yet been achieved on the intrinsically ultrafast time scales of antiferromagnets. Here, we report robust, direction-controlled and non-thermal rotation of the Néel vector $\\mathbf{L}$ by $\\pm$90° at room temperature in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au driven by phase-locked terahertz current pulses. All observed features are consistent with ultrafast Néel spin-orbit torque: First, nonlinear optical imaging reveals that the terahertz current direction sets the final orientation of $\\mathbf{L}$ in the absence of any bias field for at least two months. Second, transient optical birefringence shows that the switching proceeds ultrafast in less than 15 picoseconds. Finally, atomistic spin-dynamics simulations reproduce the observed dynamics and confirm the minor role of thermal effects. While the switching is already one order of magnitude faster than in ferromagnets at comparable dissipated energy, our simulations predict routes toward switching times and energies which are another order of magnitude lower. Our approach can be transferred to electric-field-driven switching in many more antiferromagnets, including magnetoelectric insulators.

We investigate the entanglement protection induced by mixed noise constructed from diverse noise types, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, flicker noise, and telegraph noise. Numerical simulations demonstrate that entanglement protection depends critically on the proportion of HF components in the power spectral density of the mixed noise.

In this work, efficient excitonic charge state conversion is achieved by doping monolayer WS$_2$ using water rinsed PVA and the quasiparticle densities are further enhanced by applying high periodic biaxial strain (up to 2.3%) through a 2D silica microsphere array. The method presented here enables nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion without the need of electrostatic gating, while delivering thermally stable trions with a large binding energy of ~56 meV and a high free electron density of ~3$\\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Strain-induced funneling of the PVA-injected free electrons substantially increases the excitonic quasiparticle densities and boosts the trion emission by 41%.

Instead, in our proposed quantum preferential attachment model, it uniformly randomly connects to any node within the proximity of the target, including, but not restricted to, the target itself. This local flexibility is found to qualitatively change the global network behavior, leading to two distinct classes of complex network architectures, both of which are small-world, but neither of which is scale-free. Our numerical findings are supported by rigorous analytic results, in a framework that incorporates quantum and classical variants of preferential attachment in a unified phase diagram.

To address this challenge, the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion has emerged as an effective approach, transforming the problem into a multi-parameter estimation task. However, the incompatibility between optimal measurements for different parameters prevents single-copy measurements from reaching the fundamental precision limits defined by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Meanwhile, collective measurements performed on multiple identical copies can mitigate this incompatibility and thus enhance the precision of joint parameter estimation. This work experimentally demonstrates joint phase and phase-diffusion estimation using deterministic Bell measurements on a two-qubit system. A linear optical network is employed to implement both parameter encoding and deterministic Bell measurements, achieving improved estimation precision compared to any separable measurement strategy.

Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures.

The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances.

After computing the $Q$ symbols of the positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) of noisy measurements that take into account the asymmetry effects, the operator representations for the POVMs are obtained in the form that assumes applying the additive noise quantum channel to the POVMs of noiseless (ideal) measurements. For double homodyne detection, it was found that the noiseless measurements should generally be expressed in terms of the projectors onto squeezed-states and the corresponding squeezed-state operator representation of POVM along with the measurement noise channel depend on the squeezing parameter that lies in the interval dictated by the condition for the excess noise covariance matrix to be positive semi-definite.

Experimentally measuring the OTOC, however, is notoriously challenging due to the need for time-reversed evolution. Here, we present an experimental evaluation of the OTOC on a quantum computer, using three distinct protocols to address this challenge: the rewinding time method (RTM), the weak-measurement method (WMM), and the irreversibility-susceptibility method (ISM). Our experiments investigate the quantum dynamics of an XXZ spin-1/2 chain prepared in a thermal Gibbs state. As a key contribution, we provide the first experimental demonstration of the ISM, using the numerical emulator of the trapped-ion quantum computer, reimei. We also conduct a detailed comparative analysis of all three methods, revealing method-dependent behaviors in the measured OTOC.

Extracting low-energy predictions from such simulations rely on formulating systematically-improvable representations of lattice gauge theory Hamiltonians that are efficient at all values of the gauge coupling. One such candidate representation for SU(2) is the fully gauge-fixed Hamiltonian defined in the mixed basis. This work focuses on the quantum simulation of the smallest non-trivial system: two plaquettes with open boundary conditions. A mapping of the continuous gauge field degrees of freedom to qubit-based representations is developed. It is found that as few as three qubits per plaquette is sufficient to reach per-mille level precision on predictions for observables. Two distinct algorithms for implementing time evolution in the mixed basis are developed and analyzed in terms of quantum resource estimates. One algorithm has favorable scaling in circuit depth for large numbers of qubits, while the other is more practical when qubit count is limited. The latter algorithm is used in the measurement of a real-time observable on IBM's Heron superconducting quantum processor, ibm_fez. The quantum results match classical predictions at the percent-level. This work lays out a path forward for two- and three-dimensional simulations of larger systems, as well as demonstrating the viability of mixed-basis formulations for studying the properties of SU(2) gauge theories at all values of the gauge coupling."}

This paper provides a comparative performance analysis of two distinct strategies designed to improve trainability: Lie algebraic pretraining framework that uses Lie-algebraic classical simulation to find near-optimal initializations, and non-variational QWOA (NV-QWOA) that targets a restrict parameter subspace covered by 3 hyperparameters. We benchmark both methods on the unweighted Maxcut problem using a circuit depth of $p = 256$ across 200 Erdős-Rényi and 200 3-regular graphs, each with 16 vertices. Both approaches significantly improve upon the standard randomly initialized QWOA. NV-QWOA attains a mean approximation ratio of 98.9\\% in just 60 iterations, while the Lie-algebraic pretrained QWOA improves to 77.71\\% after 500 iterations. That optimization proceeds more quickly for NV-QWOA is not surprising given its significantly smaller parameter space, however, that an algorithm with so few tunable parameters reliably finds near-optimal solutions is remarkable. These findings suggest that the structured parameterization of NV-QWOA offers a more robust training approach than pretraining on lower-dimensional auxiliary problems.

In the effort of further improving channel capacity and increasing the complexity of available quantum operations, high-dimensional and hyperentangled states are now gaining interest. Efficiently measuring these high dimensional states is challenging due to the large number of measurements required for reconstructing the full density matrix via quantum state tomography (QST), and the fact that each measurement requires some modification in the experimental setup. Here, we propose a framework for reconstructing the density matrix of a single-photon hyperentangled across multiple DOFs using a single intensity-measurement obtainable from traditional cameras, and discuss extensions for multiphoton hyperentangled states. Our method hinges on the spatial DOF of the photon and uses it to encode information from other DOFs. We numerically demonstrate this method for single-photon OAM-spin and OAM-frequency entangled states using an ideal coupler and a multimode fiber, to perform the spatial information mixing and encoding. This technique simplifies the experimental setup and reduces acquisition time compared to traditional QST based methods. Moreover, it allows recovery of DOFs that conventional cameras cannot detect, such as polarization, thus eliminating the need for projection measurements."}

We prove that a 0-regular graph battery exhibits extractable work that scales linearly with the system-size when charged using a K-regular graph. This linear scaling is shown to persist even when the charging is implemented via a collective K-regular charger with power-law decaying interactions. While no superlinear scaling is observed, the work output is found to improve systematically with increasing regularity K. Furthermore, by introducing the notion of the fraction of extractable work when only subsystems are accessible, we identify this fraction to be independent of system-size if the battery is prepared in the down-polarized product state. This independence breaks down when the battery is oriented along the x- and y-directions of the Bloch sphere."}

We demonstrate these principles within a complete quantum simulation framework based on the orbifold lattice, which enables explicit and efficient circuit constructions relevant to real-world QCD. For singlet-based approaches, we introduce a Haar-averaging projection implemented via linear combinations of unitaries, and analyze its cost and truncation errors. Beyond the singlet-approach, we show how non-singlet approaches can yield gauge-invariant observables through wave packets and string excitations. This non-singlet approach is proven to be both universal and efficient. Working in temporal gauge, we provide explicit mappings of lattice Yang-Mills dynamics to Pauli-string Hamiltonians suitable for Trotterization.

But then he rejects these ideas, on the basis that the infinity limit is \"never reached for any real system composed of a finite number of elementary systems\". In this note we present opposite views on two major points: first, admitting mathematical infinities in a physical theory is not a problem, if properly done; second, the critics of [3,4,5] comes with a major misunderstanding of these papers: they don't ask about \"the significance of the transition from classical to quantum mechanics\", but they start from a physical ontology where classical and quantum physics need each other from the beginning. This is because they postulate that a microscopic physical object (or degree of freedom) always appears as a quantum system, within a classical context.

Using control theory, we show that the optimal fields can only take the boundary values or be zero, the latter corresponding to singular control. Subsequently, using numerical optimal control and intuitive arguments, we identify some three-stage symmetric optimal pulse-sequences, for relatively larger values of the ratio between the two control bounds, and analytically calculate the corresponding pulse timings as functions of this ratio. For smaller values of the bounds ratio, numerical optimal control indicates that the optimal pulse-sequence loses its symmetry and the number of stages increases in general. In all cases, the analytical or numerical optimal protocol achieves a faster perfect chiral resolution than other pulsed protocols, mainly because of the simultaneous action of the control fields.

We analytically and numerically study the stabilizer entropy gap or magic gap: the average gap between the SE of a quantum state realized within a subspace of a larger system and the SE of the quantum state considered on its own. We find that while the stabilizer entropy gap is typically positive, requiring the injection of magic, both zero and negative magic gaps are achievable. This suggests that certain choices of embedding subspace provide strong resource advantages over others. We provide formulas for the average nonstabilizerness of a subspace given its corresponding projector and sufficient conditions for realizing zero or negative gaps: in particular, certain classes of stabilizer codes provide paradigmatic examples of the latter.

Our work demonstrates the importance of reliable simulation tools for fault-tolerant architecture design, advancing the field from simulating quantum memory to simulating a universal quantum computer."}

We show that this quantity vanishes if and only if a unitary is Clifford, is invariant under composition with Clifford unitaries, and is subadditive under tensor products. Rewriting the Clifford entropy in terms of the stabilizer entropy of the corresponding Choi state allows us to derive an upper bound: that this bound is not tight follows from considering the properties of symmetric informationally complete sets. Nevertheless we are able to numerically estimate the maximum in low dimensions, comparing it to the average over all unitaries, which we derive analytically. Finally, harnessing a concentration of measure result, we show that as the dimension grows large, with probability approaching unity, the ratio between the Clifford entropy of a Haar random unitary and that of a fixed magic gate gives a lower bound on the depth of a doped Clifford circuit which realizes the former in terms of the latter. In fact, numerical evidence suggests that this result holds reliably even in low dimensions. We conclude with several directions for future research."}

In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing."}

Engineering a topological phase transition with higher-order band touching is hence advocated, with the associated quantum Fisher information scaling as $ \\mathcal{F}_Q \\sim L^{2p}$, with $L$ the lattice size in one dimension, and $p$ the order of band touching.

Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail.

Based on the general form of the wave functions of multimode Gaussian states, we propose a universal scheme for SFS generation. For this scheme, we evaluate the probability of SFS generation and analyze the robustness of the process against imperfections in particle-number-resolving detectors. In addition, we compare the universal scheme with a nonuniversal scheme, in which the generation of SFSs depends on a specific distribution of particle numbers across the detectors. We demonstrate that the universal scheme provides a higher probability of SFS generation, at the cost of increased experimental resources."}

In this context, we consider practical application scenarios for the microwave analog quantum teleportation protocol based on continuous-variable states. We theoretically analyze the effect of feedforward losses and noise on teleportation fidelities of coherent states and show that these imperfections can be fully corrected by an appropriate feedforward gain. Furthermore, we consider quantum teleportation with finite-size codebooks and derive modified no-cloning thresholds as a function of the codebook configuration. Finally, we analyze the security of quantum teleportation under public channel attacks and demonstrate that the corresponding secure fidelity thresholds may drastically differ from the conventional no-cloning values.

While most implementations rely on spin-$1/2$ systems, we explore the performance of quantum annealing on a spin-$1$ system where the problem Hamiltonian includes a single ion anisotropy term of the form $D\\sum (S^z)^2$. Our results reveal that for a suitable range of the anisotropy strength $D$, the spin-$1$ annealer reaches the ground state with higher fidelity. We attribute this performance to the presence of the intermediate spin level and the tunable anisotropy, which together enable the algorithm to traverse the energy landscape through smaller, incremental steps instead of a single large spin flip. This mechanism effectively lowers barriers in the configuration space and stabilizes the evolution. These findings suggest that higher spin annealers offer intrinsic advantages for robust and flexible quantum optimization, especially for problems naturally formulated with ternary decision variables."}

We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching Δ system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free Δ-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms."}

We develop a framework for averaging quantum channels based on channel-state duality that converts pre- and post-processing averages into a group twirl acting directly on the Choi operator. For arbitrary unitary representations on the input and output spaces, the twirled channel is obtained as an explicit projection onto the commutant of the induced representation on $\\mathcal H_{\\rm out}\\otimes \\mathcal H_{\\rm in}$. In the collective setting, where the commutant is the walled Brauer algebra, we introduce a partial-transpose reduction that maps channel twirling to an ordinary Schur-Weyl twirl of the partially transposed Choi operator, enabling formulas in terms of permutation operators. We further extend the construction beyond compact symmetries to reductive non-unitary groups via Cartan decomposition, yielding a weighted sum of invariant-sector projections with weights determined by the Abelian component. Finally, we provide two finite realizations of channel averaging. The first one is a ``dual'' averaging protocol as a convex mixture of unitary-$1$-design channels on invariant sectors. The second one is a notion of channel $t$-designs induced by weighted group $t$-designs for $t=t_{\\rm in}+t_{\\rm out}$."}

Any consistent description of such scenarios must avoid time-travel paradoxes while respecting the no-new-physics principle, which requires that the set of operations available within any local spacetime region remain unchanged, irrespective of whether CTCs exist elsewhere. Within an information-theoretic framework, this leads to process functions: deterministic classical communication structures that remain logically consistent under arbitrary local operations, yet can exhibit correlations incompatible with any definite causal order - a phenomenon known as non-causality. In this work, we provide the first complete recursive characterization of process functions and of (non-)causal process functions. We use it to establish a correspondence between process functions and unambiguous complete product bases, i.e., product bases in which every local state belongs to a unique local basis. This equivalence implies that non-causality of process functions is exactly mirrored by quantum nonlocality without entanglement (QNLWE) - the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing separable states using local operations and causal classical communication - for such bases. Our results generalize previous special cases to arbitrary local dimensions and any number of parties, enable systematic constructions of non-causal process functions and unambiguous QNLWE bases, and reveal an unexpected connection between certain non-signaling inequalities and causal inequalities."}

We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincaré symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints."}

We employ a continuum, time-dependent Schrödinger-equation simulation that goes beyond a two-site Fermi--Hubbard description and benchmark it against experimentally implemented tunneling-based protocols, reproducing the observed single-particle tunneling and spin-exchange dynamics. For experimentally accessible lattice depths, we find that the proposed gate operates in $\\sim 21\\,μ\\mathrm{s}$, more than an order of magnitude faster than tunneling-based implementations, while achieving fidelities $\\gtrsim 99\\%$. We further analyze sensitivity to lattice-depth variations and show that a composite sequence improves robustness. Our results establish fast, collision-mediated entangling gates in superlattices as a promising building block for scalable neutral-atom quantum computation."}

We show how some weak symmetries of the Lindblad equation allow us to map the dynamics onto a classical Kinetic Monte Carlo; this simplified, effective dynamics can be described via local stochastic jumps coupled with a local deterministic component. Simulations are then used to reconstruct a phase diagram which displays stationary features completely equivalent to those of completely classical epidemic processes, but richer dynamics with multiple, recurrent waves of infection."}

We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \\ \\text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \\ \\text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand."}

Instead of assuming uniform localization and fixed hopping distances, transport is described through an effective potential whose geometry encodes the spatial organization and energy-dependent localization of quantum states. Using the associated Agmon metric, we define a generalized Mott scale that replaces the classical hopping length with a geometric criterion set by the disorder landscape. This framework naturally incorporates strong spatial inhomogeneity and yields the AC conductivity directly from the effective potential. The standard MB result is recovered as a limiting case. Our approach extends the conceptual foundation of MB theory to arbitrary disordered media and energies approaching the mobility edge, providing a unified description of AC transport in complex quantum materials."}

Review article to be submitted to Physics Reports", "summary": "Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable."}

While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems."}

In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits."}

However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases."}
