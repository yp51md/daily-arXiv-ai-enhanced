Unlike classical\nmodels, where the microscopic origins of generalized hydrodynamics are better\nunderstood, in quantum models it can only be derived using the hydrodynamic\nformalism. Using the paradigmatic and experimentally relevant repulsive\nLieb-Liniger model as an example, this thesis introduces a new viewpoint on the\ndynamics of quantum integrable models by introducing so-called semi-classical\nBethe models. These classical integrable models act as an intermediate\ndescription between the microscopic quantum realm and the macroscopic\ngeneralized hydrodynamics. After introducing these models and discussing their\nproperties, we study the generalized hydrodynamics equation using new tools and\nshow that solutions to the Euler generalized hydrodynamics equation of the\nLieb-Liniger model exist, are unique and do not develop gradient catastrophes.\nFinally, we discuss new insights into the physics governing the diffusive\ncorrection, which, contrary to prior belief, is not described by a\nNavier-Stokes-like equation. Focusing on the main intuitive ideas, the thesis\naims to provide a self-contained overview over these exciting new developments\non generalized hydrodynamics."}
