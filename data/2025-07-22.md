Abstract: The statistics of local measurements of joint quantum systems can sometimes
be used to distinguish the temporal order in which they were measured. We first
prove that every bipartite separable density matrix is temporally compatible
with direct causal influence for arbitrary finite-dimensional quantum systems
and measurements of a tomographically-complete class of observables, which
includes all Pauli observables in the case of multi-qubit systems.
Equivalently, if a bipartite density matrix is not temporally compatible with
direct causal influence, then it must be entangled. We also provide an
operational meaning for the temporal evolution consistent with such
correlations in terms of a generalized dephasing channel and a pretty good
measurement. The two temporal evolutions turn out to not be Petz recovery maps
of each other, but are Bayesian inverses of each other. Finally, we prove
necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary bipartite quantum state to
be temporally compatible, thereby providing a temporal analogue of the positive
partial transpose criterion valid for quantum systems of any dimension.

### [2] [Polar Codes for Erasure and Unital Classical-Quantum Markovian Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14323)
*Jaswanthi Mandalapu,Vikesh Siddhu,Krishna Jagannathan*

Main category: quant-ph

Motivation: 研究具有记忆的经典-量子信道，探索极化码在量子通信中的容量可达性。

Method: 利用已有的经典极化码理论（针对有限状态马尔可夫过程）和最新发现（无纠缠即可达到马尔可夫幺正和擦除量子信道的容量）。

Result: 极化码在两种噪声模型下能够达到经典容量。

Conclusion: 对于记忆性经典-量子信道，极化码是一种接近容量的有效编码策略。

Abstract: We consider classical-quantum (cq-)channels with memory, and establish that
Ar{\i}kan-constructed polar codes achieve the classical capacity for two key
noise models, namely for (i) qubit erasures and (ii) unital qubit noise with
channel state information at the receiver. The memory in the channel is assumed
to be governed by a discrete-time, countable-state, aperiodic, irreducible, and
positive recurrent Markov process. We establish this result by leveraging
existing classical polar coding guarantees established for finite-state,
aperiodic, and irreducible Markov processes [FAIM], alongside the recent
finding that no entanglement is required to achieve the capacity of Markovian
unital and erasure quantum channels when transmitting classical information.
More broadly, our work illustrates that for cq-channels with memory, where an
optimal coding strategy is essentially classical, polar codes can be shown to
approach the capacity.

Conclusion: 结果为量子计算机中量子比特的低频噪声处理提供了理论基础，并为复杂架构的量子噪声研究铺平道路。

Abstract: We extend the spin-boson model of open quantum systems to the regime of
quantum $1/f^\eta$ noise characterized by negative exponents of its spectral
distribution. Using the numerically exact time-evolving matrix product
operator, we find the dynamic regime diagram, including pseudocoherent dynamics
controlled by quantum $1/f^\eta$ noise. We determine the dephasing rate and
find for it an empirical formula valid at zero temperature. The bath
reorganization energy depends on the infrared bath cutoff frequency, revealing
an increased sensitivity of the dephasing on the measurement time of an
experiment. \ep{Our results apply to a qubit as an elementary building block of
a quantum computer and pave the way towards a quantum treatment of
low-frequency noise in more complex architectures.

Abstract: In this paper we prove a collection of results on the structure of
permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy. First, we leverage results from the
cryptography literature on affine equivalence classes of 4-bit permutations
which we use to find all 4-qubit permutations in the Clifford Hierarchy. We
then use the classification of 4-qubit permutations and previous results on the
structure of diagonal gates in the Clifford Hierarchy to prove that all 4-qubit
gates in the third level of the Clifford Hierarchy are semi-Clifford. Finally,
we introduce the formalism of cycle structures to permutations in the Clifford
Hierarchy and prove a general structure theorem about them. We also classify
many small cycle structures up to affine equivalence. Interestingly, this
classification is independent of the number of qubits.

### [5] [Quasi-degenerate resonant eigenstate doublets of two quantum emitters in a closed waveguide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14371)

Conclusion: 准简并共振双态的发现为量子技术任务提供了新的工具，特别是在能量范围内操控发射体-波导系统。

Abstract: The physics of systems of quantum emitters is significantly influenced by the
relation between their spatial separation and the wavelength of the emitted
photons. If the distance that separates a pair of emitters meets specific
resonance conditions, the photons produced from decay may destructively
interfere. In an infinite-wavelength setting, this effect gives rise to bound
states in the continuum, where a photon remains confined in between the
emitter. In the case of a finite-length waveguide with two periodic boundary
conditions, the relevant distances become two, leading to states in which a
photon is confined in either the shorter or the longer path that connects the
emitters. If the ratio of the shorter and the longer path is a rational number,
these two kinds of resonant states are allowed to co-exist in the same
Hamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the existence of quasi-degenerate
resonant doublets of a pair of identical emitters coupled to a linear waveguide
mode. The states that form the doublet are searched among the ones in which a
single excitation tends to remain bound to the emitters. We investigate the
spectrum in a finite range around degeneracy points to check whether the
doublet remains well separated from the closest eigenvalues in the spectrum.
The identification of quasi-degenerate doublets opens the possibility to
manipulate the emitters-waveguide system as an effectively two-level system in
specific energy ranges, providing an innovative tool for quantum technology
tasks.

Result: 量子纠错码可以抑制噪声并监测信道噪声特征，帮助检测潜在的窃听行为。

Conclusion: 量子纠错码可能在不改变传输量子信息的情况下，作为量子通信的隐私认证手段。

Abstract: Quantum Internet in a Nutshell (QI-Nutshell) connects the fields of quantum
communication and quantum computing by emulating quantum communication
protocols on currently available ion-trap quantum computers. We demonstrate
emulations of QKD protocols where the individual steps are mapped to physical
operations within our hardware platform. This allows us to not only practically
execute established protocols such as BB84 or BBM92, but also include cloning
attacks by an eavesdropping party, noise sources and side-channel attacks that
are generally hard to include in theoretical QKD security proofs. We
deliberately inject noise and investigate its effect on quantum communication
protocols. We employ numerical simulations in order to study the incorporation
of small quantum error correction (QEC) codes into QKD protocols. We find that
these codes can help to suppress the noise level and to monitor the noise
profile of the channel. This may enable the communicating parties to detect
suspicious deviations from expected noise characteristics as a result of
potential eavesdropping. This suggests that QEC may serve as a means of privacy
authentication for quantum communication without altering the transmitted
quantum information.

### [7] [Granovskii-Zhedanov Scar of XYZ Spin-chain: Modern Algebraic Perspectives and Realization in Higher Dimensional Lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14895)

Main category: quant-ph

Motivation: 揭示GZ疤痕态的起源，并将其与现代量子多体疤痕理论联系起来。

Method: 使用标准谱生成代数(SGA)框架和群论方法描述疤痕子空间，提出近似SGA和广义SGA方法处理XYZ情况。

Result: 在XXZ极限下疤痕子空间适用标准描述，XYZ情况下需新方法；高维系统中特定条件下可构造GZ疤痕。

Conclusion: GZ疤痕态在特定条件下可存在于高维系统，但受晶格对称性和协调数限制。

Abstract: In a work by Granovskii and Zhedanov, a surprising scar state exhibiting zero
entanglement and long periodicity was discovered in the XYZ spin chains;
remarkably, nearly three decades before the concept of many-body scars became a
subject of active research. In this study, we uncover the origin of the
Granovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar within the framework of the modern understanding
of quantum many-body scars. We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be
effectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA)
framework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian. This
description, however, is applicable only in the XXZ limit, where a quasi-$U(1)$
symmetry exists within the scar subspace. In contrast, the absence of such
quasi-$U(1)$ symmetry for the GZ scar subspace restricts the applicability of
these standard formulations. We propose two alternative techniques:
approximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar
subspace in the XYZ case. Using these approaches, we can characterize the scar
subspaces. We further explore the possibility of constructing
lattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange
systems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar
construction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be
supported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with
an odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination
numbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in
specific scenarios. Remarkably, if certain bonds retain the full $SU(2)$
symmetry of the spin-exchange interaction, thereby breaking the spatial
uniformity of the lattice, lattice-independent GZ scars can still emerge in
systems with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with an odd number of
edges.

### [8] [An Effective Reflection Mode Measurement for Hanger-Coupled Microwave Resonators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14394)
*John R. Pitten,Nicholas Materise,Wei-Ren Syong,Jorge Ramirez,Douglas Bennett,Corey Rae H. McRae*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种消除Fano不对称性的方法，通过校准测量利用谐振器中的tee结对称性，提高了超导微波谐振器测量的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超导量子器件中的两能级系统（TLS）损耗时，Fano不对称性会掩盖关键器件参数，因此需要一种方法来消除这种干扰。

Method: 利用校准的反射和透射测量线性组合得到有效反射模式（ERM），并通过3D铝腔和微带线谐振器实验验证模型。

Result: 实验显示ERM在最低功率下比标准hanger模式的不确定性降低了五倍，测量吞吐量可提高25倍。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了测量精度，还能从无法拟合的数据中提取关键参数，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Superconducting microwave resonators are used to study two-level system (TLS)
loss in superconducting quantum devices. Fano asymmetry, characterized by a
nonzero asymmetry angle $\phi$ in the diameter correction method (DCM), results
from the coupling schemes used to measure these devices, including the commonly
used hanger method. $\phi$ is an additional fitting parameter which contains no
physically interesting information and can obscure device parameters of
interest. The tee-junction symmetry nominally present in these resonator
devices provides an avenue for the elimination of Fano asymmetry using
calibrated measurement. We show that the eigenvalue associated with the common
mode excitation of the resonator is an effective reflection mode (ERM) which
has no Fano asymmetry. Our analysis reveals the cause of Fano asymmetry as
interference between common and differential modes. Practically, we obtain the
ERM from a linear combination of calibrated reflection and transmission
measurements. We utilize a 3D aluminum cavity to experimentally demonstrate the
validity and flexibility of this model. To extend the usefulness of this
symmetry analysis, we apply perturbation theory to recover the ERM in a
multiplexed coplanar waveguide resonator device and experimentally demonstrate
quantitative agreement in the extracted $Q_i^{-1}$ between hanger mode and ERM
measurements. We observe a five-fold reduction in uncertainty from the ERM
compared to the standard hanger mode at the lowest measured power, -160 dBm
delivered to the device. This method could facilitate an increase in throughput
of low-power superconducting resonator measurements by up to a factor of 25, as
well as allow the extraction of critical parameters from otherwise unfittable
device data.

### [9] [Multipartite entanglement from ditstrings for 1+1D systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14422)
*Zane Ozzello,Yannick Meurice*

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多体纠缠在识别相变临界点中的有效性。

Method: 利用强次可加性、弱单调性及其与共形性质的凸组合，结合多体纠缠量。

Result: 多体纠缠组合能更精确地定位相边界，且互信息近似可作为纠缠的下界。

Conclusion: 多体纠缠及其组合是识别临界点的有效工具，互信息近似和滤波方法可进一步优化结果。

Abstract: We show that multipartite entanglement can be used as an efficient way of
identifying the critical points of 1+1D systems. We demonstrate this with the
quantum Ising model, lattice $\lambda \phi^4$ approximated with qutrits, and
arrays of Rydberg atoms. To do so we make use of multipartite compositions of
entanglement quantities for different parts combined to form the strong
subadditivity, weak monotonicity, and a convex combination of these with
conformal properties. These quantities display some remarkable properties. We
will demonstrate how the entanglement of individual parts together displays
behavior at phase boundaries, but the combination of these in the
aforementioned quantities sharpens and localizes this behavior to the
boundaries even better. We will show that we can extend a scheme for
approximating the entanglement with the mutual information, and that this acts
as a lower bound which will also follow the changes in the entanglement for the
above quantities, despite the additional contributions of different signs. This
mutual information approximation to the identifying quantities can have its
lower probabilities removed in a process we call filtering, and despite the
combination of terms will respond well to the filtering and offer improvements
to the lower bound.

Conclusion: 空间非均匀性对纯化相变具有显著影响，不仅改变临界性，还可能导致新的量子相的出现。

Abstract: Noise is inevitable in realistic quantum circuits. It arises randomly in
space. Inspired by spatial non-uniformity of the noise, we investigate the
effects of spatial modulation on purification phase transitions in a hybrid
random Clifford circuit. As an efficient observable for extracting quantum
entanglement in mixed states, we employ many-body negativity. The behavior of
the many-body negativity well characterizes the presence of the purification
phase transitions and its criticality. We find the effect of spatial
non-uniformity in measurement probability on purification phase transition. The
criticality of the purification phase transition changes from that of uniform
probability, which is elucidated from the argument of the Harris criterion. The
critical correlation length exponent $\nu$ changes from $\nu < 2$ for uniform
probability to $\nu > 2$ for spatially modulated probability. We further
investigate a setting where two-site random Clifford gate becomes spatially
(quasi-)modulated. We find that the modulation induces a phase transition,
leading to a different pure phase where a short-range quantum entanglement
remains.

Abstract: While photonic entanglement generation and distribution are well developed,
their demonstrated rates are far below what is needed for a quantum internet.
The present paper proposes and analyzes a scheme for spectral multiplexing that
provides entanglement-distribution rates well in excess of the state of the
art. It builds on the idea presented by Chen~\emph{et al}.~[Phys. Rev. Appl.
{\bf 19}, 054209 (2023)], who proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) as a
means for high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic entanglement generation.
Unfortunately, Chen \emph{et al}.'s ZALM requires a large number (800) of
spectral channels to achieve its claimed high-fidelity, quasi-deterministic,
high-rate entanglement generation. Our modified version of ZALM affords major
performance improvements over the original. It draws on Morrison~\emph{et
al}.~[APL Photon. {\bf 7}, 066102 (2022)], who domain engineered a $\chi^{(2)}$
crystal to realize a biphoton wave function with 8 discrete and
spectrally-factorable frequency bins. Our ZALM SPDCs each have a modest number
($N_I\ll$ 800) of these phase-matched spectral islands each generating two-mode
squeezed-vacuum states, permitting our analysis, unlike Chen~\emph{et al.}'s,
to account for multipairs of all orders, losses in the partial BSM, and
propagation losses en route to the receivers. A major innovation in our
proposal is to employ both same-island heralding and cross-island heralding,
which allows the entanglement-delivery rate to scale as $N_I^2$ rather than
$N_I$ in the weak squeezing regime required for the reception of photon pairs
with a high Bell-state fidelity under realistic losses. This heralding scheme
uses an order of magnitude fewer spectral channels, which may enable near-term
implementations of satellite-to-ground or fiber-optic based ZALM architectures.

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化量子电路，显著减少双量子比特门数量，提升效率和可靠性。

Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, two-qubit gates in
quantum circuits are more susceptible to noise than single-qubit gates.
Therefore, reducing the number of two-qubit gates is crucial for improving
circuit efficiency and reliability. As quantum circuits scale up, the
optimization search space becomes increasingly complex, leading to challenges
such as low efficiency and suboptimal solutions. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a quantum circuit optimization approach based on dynamic
grouping and ZX-calculus. First, a random strategy-based dynamic grouping
method partitions the circuit into multiple subcircuits. Second, a ZX-calculus
guided k-step lookahead search performs equivalent subcircuit filtering to
minimize two-qubit gate counts. Third, a delay-aware placement method optimizes
the recombined circuit to reduce the overall gate count. Finally, simulated
annealing iteratively updates the grouping strategy to achieve an optimized
two-qubit gate count. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in reducing two-qubit
gates. Compared to the original circuits, the approach achieves an average
reduction of 18% in two-qubit gates. It outperforms classical methods with up
to 25% reduction, especially on gf circuits, and shows a 4% average improvement
over heuristic ZX-calculus-based methods, validating its efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对超导电路测量中状态跃迁的理解，展示了通量量子比特实现快速高保真读取的潜力。

Abstract: State transitions during qubit measurements are extremely detrimental to
quantum tasks that rely on repeated measurements, such as quantum error
correction. These state transitions can occur when excessive measurement power
leads to qubit excitations outside its computational space. Alternatively, the
qubit state can decay rapidly when the measurement protocol inadvertently
couples the qubit to lossy modes such as two-level systems (TLSs). We
experimentally verify the impact of these TLSs in qubit readout by measuring
the transition errors at different qubit flux bias. Because such state
transitions during measurements are often localized in frequency space, we
demonstrate the ability to avoid them during a fluxonium readout by exploiting
the qubit's flux-tunability. By synchronizing the flux bias with the readout
photon dynamics, we obtain an optimal readout fidelity of 99 % (98.4 %) in 1 us
(0.5 us) integration time. Our work advances the understanding of state
transitions in superconducting circuit measurements and demonstrates the
potential of fluxonium qubits to achieve fast high-fidelity readout.

Abstract: Quantum state preparation is a fundamental task in quantum computing and
quantum information processing. With the rapid advancement of quantum
technologies, efficient quantum state preparation has become increasingly
important. This paper proposes a novel approach for quantum state preparation
based on the Local Invertible Map Tensor Decision Diagram (LimTDD). LimTDD
combines the advantages of tensor networks and decision diagrams, enabling
efficient representation and manipulation of quantum states. Compared with the
state-of-the-art quantum state preparation method, LimTDD demonstrates
substantial improvements in efficiency when dealing with complex quantum
states, while also reducing the complexity of quantum circuits. Examples
indicate that, in the best-case scenario, our method can achieve exponential
efficiency gains over existing methods. This study not only highlights the
potential of LimTDD in quantum state preparation but also provides a robust
theoretical and practical foundation for the future development of quantum
computing technologies.

Abstract: Spectator-induced leakage poses a fundamental challenge to scalable quantum
computing, particularly as frequency collisions become unavoidable in
multi-qubit processors. We introduce a leakage mitigation strategy based on
dynamically reshaping the system Hamiltonian. Our technique utilizes a tunable
coupler to enforce a block-diagonal structure on the effective Hamiltonian
governing near-resonant spectator interactions, confining the gate dynamics to
a two-dimensional invariant subspace and thus preventing leakage by
construction. On a multi-qubit superconducting processor, we experimentally
demonstrate that this dynamic control scheme suppresses leakage rates to the
order of $10^{-4}$ across a wide near-resonant detuning range. The method also
scales effectively with the number of spectators. With three simultaneous
spectators, the total leakage remains below the threshold relevant for surface
code error correction. This approach eases the tension between dense frequency
packing and high-fidelity gate operation, establishing dynamic Hamiltonian
engineering as an essential tool for advancing fault-tolerant quantum
computing.

Abstract: Quantum sensing has seen rapid progress from laboratory research to
real-world applications. Solid-state spin systems, particularly
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, are attractive for their ability to
operate at room temperature with high sensitivity. However, electron spin
coherence due to noise from the surrounding spin bath and this environment
effect limits the sensitivity of NV centers. Thus, a critical task in NV
center-based quantum sensing is sensitivity enhancement through coherence
protection. Nuclear spin assisted protocols have demonstrated greater
enhancement of electron spin coherence due to the naturally occurring electron
and nuclear spin pair. The longer nuclear coherence times allow for long-lived
memory bit for quantum information protocols. This review discusses the physics
of NV centers, the mechanisms and variations of nuclear spin-assisted
protocols, and their applications in nuclear spin spectroscopy, atomic imaging,
and magnetic sensing. Challenges in sensitivity enhancement, commercialization
prospects, and future research directions are also explored.

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量子LDPC码长期存在的距离障碍问题，同时保持横向非克利福德门的实现能力。

Method: 采用三个良好qLDPC码的同调积，结合Freedman-Hastings码到流形映射和三重杯积实现横向CCZ门。

Result: 新代码实现Ω(N^{2/3})距离和Θ(N^{2/3})维度，支持单次无蒸馏制备Θ(N^{1/3})独立逻辑CCZ魔法态。

Conclusion: 该代码不仅突破距离障碍，还启发了一类新流形的发现，具有潜在数学和物理意义。

Abstract: Historically, a $\sqrt{N}log^{1/2}(N)$ distance barrier for quantum
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with $N$ qubits persisted for nearly two
decades, until the recent discovery of the fibre-bundle code. An open question
is whether such a distance barrier can be broken while preserving the ability
to perform transversal non-Clifford gates. In this direction, another
long-standing distance barrier of $N^{1/3}$ for LDPC stabilizer codes --
present since the discovery of the 3D color code -- was only recently overcome
by a construction achieving an $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ distance (arXiv:2501.19375).
The present work further breaks the $\sqrt{N}$ distance barrier by taking a
homological product of three good qLDPC codes, combined with the
Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping and the triple cup product to
implement transversal CCZ gates. The resulting code achieves an
$\Omega(N^{2/3})$ distance (a linear $X$-distance of $\Theta(N)$) and a
dimension of $\Theta(N^{2/3})$, which enables fault-tolerant preparation of
$\Theta(N^{1/3})$ independent logical CCZ magic states in a single shot,
without distillation (`magic state fountain'). This new quantum code also
inspires the discovery of a family of exotic $3q$-dimensional manifolds
$\mathcal{M}$, which exhibit both a power-law $\mathbb{Z}_2$-($q$,
$2q$)-systolic freedom and $\Theta(vol(\mathcal{M}))$ triple intersection
points of $2q$-dimensional submanifolds.

Result: 确定了不同初始激发条件下亚辐射的产生情况，包括弱激光开关驱动的原子。

Conclusion: 研究为有序系统中亚辐射的检测提供了理论支持，并讨论了不同激发条件下的亚辐射生成机制。

Abstract: Studies of subradiance in a chain N two-level atoms in the single excitation
regime focused mainly on the complex spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian,
identifying subradiant eigenvalues. This can be achieved by finding the
eigenvalues $N$ of the Hamiltonian or by evaluating the expectation value of
the Hamiltonian on a generalized Dicke state, depending on a continuous
variable k. This has the advantage that the sum above N can be calculated
exactly, such that N becomes a simple parameter of the system and no more the
size of the Hilbert space. However, the question remains how subradiance
emerges from atoms initially excited or driven by a laser. Here we study the
dynamics of the system, solving the coupled-dipole equations for N atoms and
evaluating the probability to be in a generalized Dicke state at a given time.
Once the subradiant regions has been identified, it is simple to see if
subradiance is being generated. We discuss different initial excitation
conditions that lead to subradiance and the case of atoms excited by switching
on and off a weak laser. This may be relevant for future experiments aimed at
detecting subradiance in ordered systems.

proposal of the original thought experiment. In this paper, we explore its
initial implications, which shook the foundations of classical physics, and
then progress to an examination of the recent theoretical advancements and the
ingenious extended versions of the experiment. The recent versions seem to
imply that it is no more possible to consider events as absolute.

Motivation: 开发资源高效的量子处理器单元（QPU）需要确定实现可控性所需的最少局部控制和量子比特耦合数量。

Method: 证明通过单个两量子位门连接两个可控的量子比特阵列，可以构建一个更大的可控QPU。

Result: 该方法通过两个示例（10和127量子比特）验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建模块化QPU提供了模板，减少了局部控制和耦合的需求。

Abstract: Universal quantum computing requires the ability to perform every unitary
operation, i.e., evolution operator controllability. In view of developing
resource-efficient quantum processing units (QPUs), it is important to
determine how many local controls and qubit-qubit couplings are required for
controllability. Unfortunately, assessing the controllability of large qubit
arrays is a difficult task, due to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space
dimension. Here we show that it is sufficient to connect two qubit arrays that
are evolution operator controllable by a single entangling two-qubit gate in
order to obtain a composite qubit array that is evolution operator
controllable. Our proof provides a template to build up modular QPUs from
smaller building blocks with reduced numbers of local controls and couplings.
We illustrate the approach with two examples, consisting of 10, respectively
127 qubits, inspired by IBM quantum processors.

Abstract: We establish a unified framework for dynamical quantum phase transitions
(DQPTs) in non-Hermitian systems that encompasses both biorthogonal and
self-norm non-biorthogonal formulations for pure and mixed states. Our
framework provides explicit expressions for the Loschmidt amplitude, Loschmidt
echo, and rate function, revealing a universal geometric signature of DQPTs:
orthogonality of two related vectors in two-dimensional real space. Strikingly,
we demonstrate that non-biorthogonal quenches from non-Hermitian to Hermitian
Hamiltonians under chiral symmetry exhibit emergent topological
characteristics, unveiling the intrinsic topological nature of DQPTs beyond
conventional Hermitian regimes. This work establishes fundamental geometric and
topological principles governing quantum criticality in open systems, with
implications for quantum sensing and many-body physics in dissipative
environments.

Motivation: 偏振纠缠在光学量子信息处理中广泛应用，但其在损耗信道中的传输速率受限，限制了实际应用。

Result: 实验展示了速率-损耗比例的平方根提升，并实现了保真度为0.843的偏振纠缠光子对分布。

Conclusion: 该结果为构建近未来量子网络及其应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Polarization entanglement is widely used in optical quantum information
processing due to its compatibility with standard optical components. On the
other hand, it is known that polarization entanglement is susceptible to the
loss, more precisely, its transmission rate in a lossy channel is limited by
the scaling of O({\eta}), where {\eta} is a transmittance of the channel. Here,
we experimentally demonstrate that this rate-loss scaling limit can be overcome
by a relatively simple protocol. This is possible by integrating the idea of
the polarizaion-photon-number hybrid entanglement and the single-click
entanglement swapping. We demonstrate square root improvement of the rate-loss
scaling from the conventional approaches and achieve the fidelity of 0.843 for
the distributed polarization entangled photon pairs. This improvement in the
rate-loss scaling is equivalent to that achieved by 1-hop quantum repeater
node. Our result paves a way to build a near-future quantum network and its
applications.

Abstract: With rapid advancements in quantum computing, it is widely believed that
there will be quantum hardware capable of compromising classical cryptography
and hence, the internet and the current information security infrastructure in
the coming decade. This is mainly due to the operational realizations of
quantum algorithms such as Grover and Shor, to which the current classical
encryption protocols are vulnerable. Blockchains, i.e., blockchain data
structures and their data, rely heavily on classical cryptography. One approach
to secure blockchain is to attempt to achieve information theoretical security
by defining blockchain on quantum technologies. There have been two
conceptualizations of blockchains on quantum registers: the time-entangled
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state blockchain and the quantum hypergraph
blockchain. On our part, an attempt is made to conceptualize a new quantum
blockchain combining features of both these schemes to achieve the absolute
security of the time-temporal GHZ blockchain and the scalability and efficiency
of the quantum hypergraph blockchain in the proposed quantum blockchain
protocol.

Conclusion: 相位空间构造与Young表图相关，为对称N-quDit系统的非经典行为提供了新的理解。

Abstract: For a symmetric $N$-quDit system described by a density matrix $\rho$, we
construct a one-parameter $s$ family $\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_\rho$ of
quasi-probability distributions through generalized Fano multipole operators
and Stratonovich-Weyl kernels. The corresponding phase space is the complex
projective ${C}P^{D-1}=U(D)/U(D-1)\times U(1)$, related to fully symmetric
irreducible representations of the unitary group $U(D)$. For the particular
cases $D=2$ (qubits) and $D=3$ (qutrits), we analyze the phase-space structure
of Schr\"odinger $U(D)$-spin cat (parity adapted coherent) states and we
provide plots of the corresponding Wigner $\mathcal{F}^{(0)}_\rho$ function. We
examine the connection between non-classical behavior and the negativity of the
Wigner function. We also compute the generalized heat kernel relating two
quasi-probability distributions $\mathcal{F}^{(s)}_\rho$ and
$\mathcal{F}^{(s')}_\rho$, with $t=(s'-s)/2$ playing the role of ``time'',
together with their twisted Moyal product in terms of a trikernel. In the
thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$, we recover the usual Gaussian smoothing for
$s'>s$. A diagramatic interpretation of the phase-space construction in terms
of Young tableaux is also provided.

Abstract: Traditionally, the characterization of quantum resources has focused on
individual quantum states. Recent literature, however, has increasingly
explored the characterization of resources in multi-states (ordered collections
of states indexed by a varying parameter). In this work, we provide a
unitary-invariant framework to pinpoint imaginarity and coherence in sets of
qubit states: we prove that Bloch vectors must be coplanar to be
imaginarity-free and colinear to be incoherent, yielding exact rank-based tests
of coherence and imaginarity, and closed-form bounds for existing robustness
quantifiers, all based on two-state overlaps only. We also show that the set of
imaginarity-free multi-states is not convex, and that third-order invariants
completely characterize multi-state imaginarity of single-qubits but not of
higher-dimensional systems. As our main technical result, we show that every
Bargmann invariant of single-qubit states is determined (up to conjugation) by
two-state overlaps. Beyond qubits, we give purity and system-agnostic coherence
witnesses from equality constraints on higher-order invariants and connect our
results to practical protocols: characterization of partial distinguishability,
spin-chirality detection, and subchannel discrimination.

Abstract: The determination of the ground and low-lying excited states is critical in
many studies of quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics. Recent
theoretical work proposes a variational quantum eigensolver using ancillary
qubits to generate entanglement in the variational circuits, which avoids
complex ansatz circuits and successive measurements in the previous algorithms.
In this work, we employ the ancilla-entangled variational quantum eigensolver
to simultaneously compute multiple low-lying eigenenergies and eigenstates of
the H2 molecule and three- and five-spin transverse field Ising models (TFIMs)
on a superconducting quantum processor. We obtain the potential energy curves
of H2 and show an indication of antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase
transition in the TFIMs from the average absolute magnetization. Our
experiments demonstrate that the algorithm is capable of simultaneously
determining multiple eigenenergies and eigenstates of many-body systems with
high efficiency and accuracy and with less computational resources.

Abstract: Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) stand out as a prominent group of fluorescent
probes that are extensively utilized in biological detection. However, research
on LBTs has predominantly emphasized their fluorescence properties, which
frequently compromised by background fluorescence noise. Investigating magnetic
properties could optimize detection methodologies that offer enhanced
sensitivity and specificity. In this study, we measured the response of a
relaxometer based on ensemble nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to
various amounts of LBTs with gadolinium ions, determining the detection limit
of LBTs to be 25 fmol. We then proposed and demonstrated a detection scheme
employing the NV relaxometer to detect specific binding between LBTs and
target. Specifically, we assessed the relaxometer's response to various
concentrations of the interaction between the modified LBTs and
Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-COVID-2 spike protein, with the detection
threshold reaching ~1 pmol. Our research provides a potential application
platform for biomarker detection under picomole concentration by using NV

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) play a vital role in non-Hermitian (NH) systems,
driving unique dynamical phenomena and promising innovative applications.
However, the NH dynamics at EPs remains obscure due to the incomplete
biorthogonal eigenspaces of defective NH Hamiltonians and thus is often
avoided. In this Letter, we systematically establish pseudo-completeness
relations at EPs by employing all available generalized eigenstates, where both
single and multiple arbitrary-order EPs embracing degenerate scenarios are
addressed, to unveil EP dynamics. We reveal that depending on EP order and
initial conditions, the EP dynamics is characterized by a \emph{polynomial
growth over time} of EP eigenstates or their superposition, which will dominate
long-term evolution despite real spectra protected by pseudo-Hermiticity (PH),
or can also become unitary. We further introduce two PH-compliant NH models to
demonstrate these EP dynamics and explore their applications. This work
completes the dynamical investigation of NH physics, offers valuable insights
into nonunitary EP evolution, and further lays the groundwork for engineering
NH devices and exploiting other EP-related technologies.

Result: 微腔OLED亮度显著提升，光谱变窄，色彩更纯，且低电压下性能优于传统OLED。

Conclusion: 微腔OLED利用集体效应，为下一代高效、高亮度显示和照明技术提供了新途径。

Abstract: Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are central to modern display
technologies and are promising candidates for low-cost energy-efficient
lighting. Their performance is determined by numerous, intricate fabrication
parameters, but not least by the number of emissive molecules N, which provide
sites for electron-hole recombination and photon generation in the diode host
matrix. Counterintuitively, larger concentrations of emitters do not always
lead to brighter or more efficient OLEDs due to concentration quenching of
luminescence meaning that rates of radiative electron-hole recombination can
become severely reduced, negatively impacting charge-to-photon conversion
efficiency. In this work we trigger steady-state superradiant light emission
from a series of Fabry-P\'erot microcavity OLEDs by scaling the operating
voltage of each device with emitter concentration. We demonstrate a collective
enhancement in the luminance of a microcavity OLED that scales
super-extensively when compared to no-cavity controls fabricated in the same
run. Triggering quantum correlations between emitters via the confined cavity
field allows devices with fewer emitters to match or even exceed the brightness
of control OLEDs even when driven by lower voltages. Moreover, our devices show
significant narrowing of their emission spectra, offering purer colours at low
applied voltages. Leveraging collective effects in microcavity OLEDs provides a
new approach to enable brighter, more efficient devices paving the way for
next-generation displays and lighting that do not compromise performance for
operational efficiency or device lifetime.

Result: 新方法成功解释了量子力学中的“双缝实验”之谜，并通过Rota风格的枚举组合学处理了量子统计。

Conclusion: 划分逻辑为量子力学提供了新的视角，解决了其核心问题，并展示了范畴论在科学中的深远影响。

Abstract: This paper traces an intellectual journey or \textit{Way} (in the sense of a
Tao) that starts with some unfinished work of Gian-Carlo Rota on making a logic
of equivalence relations or partitions. Rota understood the category-theoretic
duality between subsets and partitions which implied there should be a logic of
partitions dual to the usual Boolean logic of subsets.And just as probability
starts quantitatively with the size of a subset, so he saw that information
should start with some notion of size of a partition. After developing the
logic of partitions and its quantitative version as logical entropy, it became
clear that there is a fundamental duality, fully developed only in category
theory, that runs through the exact sciences. Classical physics lies on the
subset side and quantum physics on the partition side of the duality. The rest
of the paper develops the treatment of quantum mechanics seen through the lens
of partitions as the logic of definiteness and indefiniteness. The lattices of
partitions allows the treatment of quantum phenomena in highly simplified but
essential terms. Since Feynman saw the``only mystery'' of quantum mechanics in
the two-slit experiment, this new approach is developed to show how to resolve
that mystery. Finally, quantum statistics is treated using Rota-style
enumerative combinatorics.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$晶体中偏振和温度对光学跃迁特性的影响，发现$Z_1\to Y_1$跃迁在1532.6 nm处具有稳定波长、窄线宽、偏振无关性及大吸收截面，适合量子存储器应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发量子存储器需要材料具备长光学相干时间和与通信波段兼容的特性，Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$因其优异性能成为候选材料。

Method: 通过测量晶体沿$a$和$c$轴的光学跃迁（$Z_1\to Y_1$和$Z_1\to Y_2$）的吸收强度、中心波长和线宽，分析偏振和温度的影响。

Result: $Z_1\to Y_1$跃迁在1532.6 nm处表现出稳定波长、窄线宽、偏振无关性及大吸收截面，特别适合量子存储器。

Conclusion: Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$中的$Z_1\to Y_1$跃迁因其优异特性，是量子存储器应用的理想选择。

Abstract: In the endeavour of developing quantum memories, Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$ has
emerged as a promising rare-earth ion-doped (REID) crystal platform due to its
long optical coherence times and compatibility with the 1550 nm
telecommunications band. This work investigates the effects of polarisation and
temperature on the absorption strength, central wavelength, and linewidth of
the $Z_1\to Y_1$ and $Z_1\to Y_2$ optical transitions, with light incident
along the crystal $a$ and $c$ axes. It is found that the $Z_1\to Y_1$
transition at 1532.6 nm with the incident laser along the $c$-axis at cryogenic
temperatures ($\sim$3 K) is particularly favourable. The transition exhibits a
stable central wavelength, narrower linewidth, polarisation independence,
larger absorption cross-section, and lies within the C-band -- attributes that
make it highly suitable for quantum memory applications.

Abstract: This paper explores the applications of quantum annealing (QA) and classical
simulated annealing (SA) to a suite of combinatorial optimization problems in
machine learning, namely feature selection, instance selection, and clustering.
We formulate each task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
problem and implement both quantum and classical solvers to compare their
effectiveness. For feature selection, we propose several QUBO configurations
that balance feature importance and redundancy, showing that quantum annealing
(QA) produces solutions that are computationally more efficient. In instance
selection, we propose a few novel heuristics for instance-level importance
measures that extend existing methods. For clustering, we embed a
classical-to-quantum pipeline, using classical clustering followed by
QUBO-based medoid refinement, and demonstrate consistent improvements in
cluster compactness and retrieval metrics. Our results suggest that QA can be a
competitive and efficient tool for discrete machine learning optimization, even
within the constraints of current quantum hardware.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对Grover算法的理解，并展示了热力学和几何在量子算法设计中的潜在作用。

Abstract: We reveal the power of Grover's algorithm from thermodynamic and geometric
perspectives by showing that it is a product formula approximation of
imaginary-time evolution (ITE), a Riemannian gradient flow on the special
unitary group. This viewpoint uncovers three key insights. First, we show that
the ITE dynamics trace the shortest path between the initial and the solution
states in complex projective space. Second, we prove that the geodesic length
of ITE determines the query complexity of Grover's algorithm. This complexity
notably aligns with the known optimal scaling for unstructured search. Lastly,
utilizing the geodesic structure of ITE, we construct a quantum signal
processing formulation for ITE without post-selection, and derive a new set of
angles for the fixed-point search. These results collectively establish a
deeper understanding of Grover's algorithm and suggest a potential role for
thermodynamics and geometry in quantum algorithm design.

Result: 初始状态选择产生的相关性支持EPR论证和贝尔非局域性的直观反事实。

Conclusion: 这一发现对因果建模领域有新的启示，尤其是量子纠缠的普遍性。

Abstract: In statistics and causal modeling it is common for a selection process to
induce correlations in a subset of an uncorrelated ensemble. We propose that
EPR and Bell correlations are selection artefacts of this kind. The selection
process is preparation of the initial state of the relevant experiments. Choice
of initial state amounts to preselection of a subensemble of a larger,
uncorrelated, virtual ensemble of possble histories. Because it is preselection
rather than postselection, the resulting correlations support the intuitive
counterfactuals of the EPR argument and Bell nonlocality. In this respect, and
in its temporal orientation, the case differs from familiar forms of selection
bias. Given the ubiquity of quantum entanglement, the result may thus be of
independent interest to students of causal modeling. The paper concludes with a
discussion of its novel implications in that field.

Conclusion: 该方法具有广泛适用性，尤其在量子计算分子系统中表现出高效和精确性。

Abstract: Accurately solving the Schr\"odinger equation remains a central challenge in
computational physics, chemistry, and materials science. Here, we propose an
alternative eigenvalue problem based on a system's autocorrelation function,
avoiding direct reference to a wave function. In particular, we develop a
rigorous approximation framework that enables precise frequency estimation from
a finite number of signal samples. Our analysis builds on new results involving
prolate spheroidal wave functions and yields error bounds that reveal a sharp
accuracy transition governed by the observation time and spectral density of
the signal. These results are very general and thus carry far. As one important
example application we consider the quantum computation for molecular systems.
By combining our spectral method with a quantum subroutine for signal
generation, we define quantum prolate diagonalization (QPD) - a hybrid
classical-quantum algorithm. QPD simultaneously estimates ground and excited
state energies within chemical accuracy at the Heisenberg limit. An analysis of
different input states demonstrates the robustness of the method, showing that
high precision can be retained even under imperfect state preparation.

Abstract: Generating large, non-trivial quantum chemistry test problems with known
ground-state solutions remains a core challenge for benchmarking electronic
structure methods. Inspired by planted-solution techniques from combinatorial
optimization, we introduce four classes of Hamiltonians with embedded,
retrievable ground states. These Hamiltonians mimic realistic electronic
structure problems, support adjustable complexity, and are derived from
reference systems. Crucially, their ground-state energies can be computed
exactly, provided the construction parameters are known. To obscure this
structure and control perceived complexity, we introduce techniques such as
killer operators, balance operators, and random orbital rotations. We showcase
this framework using examples based on homogeneous catalysts of industrial
relevance and validate tunable difficulty through density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) convergence behavior. Beyond enabling scalable,
ground-truth benchmark generation, our approach offers a controlled setting to
explore the limitations of electronic structure methods and investigate how
Hamiltonian structure influences ground state solution difficulty.

Conclusion: 该方案为全球量子网络提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Global-scale entanglement distribution has been a formidable challenge due to
the unavoidable losses in communication channels. Here, we propose a novel
backbone channel for quantum network based on balloon-based aerial relays. We
demonstrate for the first time that the atmospheric disturbances in
balloon-based channels can be almost eliminated through optimizing beam waist
positions and employing a series of adaptive optics systems, which boosts the
channel efficiency to -21 dB over a 10,000 km distance, outperforming
satellite-based relays by 12 dB with same device parameters. We then propose a
global-scale quantum networking scheme based on hybrid-channel quantum
repeaters that combine ground-based quantum repeaters and balloon-based aerial
relays. Servers are interconnected globally via a chain of balloons, while
clients link to local servers through fiber connections, facilitating rapid
client switching and network scalability. Our simulations, employing
state-of-the-art Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ quantum memories and mature
entanglement sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion,
demonstrate an entanglement distribution rate in the sub-Hertz range between
clients separated by 10,000 km. This approach offers a practical path toward
global quantum networking in the near future.

Abstract: 1H polarization of 61% was achieved by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization using
photoexcited triplet electrons (Triplet-DNP) at room temperature and in 0.64 T.
We introduced dibenz[a, h]anthracene as a new host molecule of the polarizing
agent, pentacene-d14. Its rigid structure provides a long spin-lattice
relaxation time (T1) of more than 2 hours at room temperature. The single
crystal of dibenz[a, h]anthracene doped with 0.05 mol% pentacene-d14 was grown
by the Bridgman method, and cut into a small piece of ~1 mg for Triplet-DNP
experiment. The 1H polarization buildup and relaxation measurements indicated
that paramagnetic relaxation became the major source of the relaxation than
spin-lattice relaxation. Finally, two promising applications of
room-temperature hyperpolarization, i .e. nuclear ordering and
radiation-tolerant polarized target, are discussed.

Abstract: Time crystals are classified into discrete time crystals and continuous time
crystals based on whether they spontaneously break time-translation symmetry.
Continuous-time crystals do not require external driving. By introducing
AdS/CFT duality to time crystals, we derive their thermodynamic limit and find
that in strongly correlated many-body systems such as a 3D optical lattice,
cooperative many-body tunneling enables time crystals to oscillate
spontaneously. In strongly correlated quantum systems driven by many-body
cooperative tunneling, we discover a universal scaling law governing the
time-crystalline phase transition at a critical temperature.

Abstract: Large-scale quantum computers are expected to benefit from modular
architectures. Validating the capabilities of modular devices requires
benchmarking strategies that assess performance within and between modules. In
this work, we evaluate cross-platform verification protocols, which are
critical for quantifying how accurately different modules prepare the same
quantum state -- a key requirement for modular scalability and system-wide
consistency. We demonstrate these algorithms using a six-qubit flip-chip
superconducting quantum device consisting of two three-qubit modules on a
single carrier chip, with connectivity for intra- and inter-module
entanglement. We examine how the resource requirements of protocols relying
solely on classical communication between modules scale exponentially with
qubit number, and demonstrate that introducing an inter-module two-qubit gate
enables sub-exponential scaling in cross-platform verification. This approach
reduces the number of repetitions required by a factor of four for three-qubit
states, with greater reductions projected for larger and higher-fidelity
devices.

Abstract: We consider multiparameter quantum metrology problem with bright soliton
networks in the presence of weak losses. We introduce General Heisenberg Limit
(GHL) $\sigma_{\boldsymbol{\chi}}=1/N^k$ that characterizes fundamental
limitations for unknown parameter measurement and estimation accuracy
$\sigma_{\boldsymbol{\chi}}$ within linear ($k=1$) and nonlinear ($k=3$)
quantum metrology approaches to solitons. We examine multipartite $N00N$ states
specially prepared for the improvement of multiparameter estimation protocols.
As a particular example of producing such states, we propose the three-mode
soliton Josephson junction (TMSJJ) system as a three mode extension for the
soliton Josephson junction (SJJ) bosonic model, which we previously proposed.
The energy spectrum of the TMSJJ exhibits sharp phase transition peculiarities
for the TMSJJ ground state. The transition occurs from a Gaussian-like
(coherent) state to the superposition of entangled Fock states, which rapidly
approach the three-mode $N00N$ state. We show that in the presence of weak
losses, the TMSJJ enables saturate scaling relevant to the optimal state limit
close to the GHL. Our findings open new prospects for quantum network sensorics
with atomtronic circuits.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants underpin modern machine
learning by enabling efficient optimization of large-scale models. However,
their local search nature limits exploration in complex landscapes. In this
paper, we introduce Stochastic Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (SQHD), a quantum
optimization algorithm that integrates the computational efficiency of
stochastic gradient methods with the global exploration power of quantum
dynamics. We propose a Lindbladian dynamics as the quantum analogue of
continuous-time SGD. We further propose a discrete-time gate-based algorithm
that approximates these dynamics while avoiding direct Lindbladian simulation,
enabling practical implementation on near-term quantum devices. We rigorously
prove the convergence of SQHD for convex and smooth objectives. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that SQHD also exhibits advantages in non-convex
optimization. All these results highlight its potential for quantum-enhanced
machine learning.

Abstract: In this work, we examine the physical process of stimulated emission as a
model for state-dependent quantum copying. We explore how a quantum state, for
instance, a photon polarization, can be cloned through light-matter
interactions when the ancillary system, such as an excited atom, effectively
encodes prior information about the quantum state. This process, while
resembling quantum cloning, adheres to the no-cloning theorem due to its
state-dependent and non-universal nature. We clarify the distinction between
universal cloning and conditional copying, and demonstrate that stimulated
emission offers a concrete physical realization of state-dependent quantum
copying.

Abstract: We analyze realistic vulnerabilities of decoy-state quantum key distribution
(QKD) arising from the combination of laser damage attack (LDA) and unambiguous
state discrimination (USD). While decoy-state QKD is designed to protect
against photon-number-splitting and beam-splitting attacks by accurately
estimating the single-photon fraction, it relies on stable attenuation to
prepare pulses with fixed mean-photon numbers. An eavesdropper (Eve) can
exploit LDA to irreversibly alter the optical components on Alice's side,
effectively increasing the mean-photon numbers beyond the decoy-state security
regime. We show that once the alteration exceeds a critical threshold - on the
order of 10--20 dB - Eve can implement an efficient USD-based intercept-resend
strategy using current off-the-shelf technology, thus obtaining the entire
secret key. Numerical simulations confirm that for sufficiently elevated
mean-photon numbers, Eve's conclusive measurement outcomes skew the decoy-state
statistics, yet remain undetected by standard security checks. We further
demonstrate how a modified USD setup employing an additional beam splitter can
reduce the required threshold, facilitating Eve's attack. Our findings
emphasize the need for robust safeguards against high-power laser damage in QKD
systems, including careful hardware selection, rigorous testing under
high-power illumination, and real-time monitoring to ensure the integrity of
the decoy-state protocol.

Abstract: Quantum memories are indispensable for quantum repeater networks,
deterministic generation of single- or multi-photon states, and linear optical
quantum computing. Although experiments have demonstrated that
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) quantum memories can store
entangled photons, a definitive theoretical framework verifying the
preservation of entanglement and nonlocality has not been rigorously
established. Here, we develop a comprehensive model by integrating the
dark-state polariton framework with reduced-density-operator theory to derive
the retrieved density operator under realistic ground-state decoherence
conditions. Our analysis reveals that decoherence inevitably causes probe
photon loss, converting a Bell state into a mixed state. Crucially, we predict
a critical storage efficiency threshold of 89.7%. Only when this threshold is
exceeded does the retrieved probe photon state violate the Clauser-Horne
inequality, thereby preserving nonlocality; below this point, nonlocal
correlations vanish. Moreover, our theory shows that multiple spatially
separated EIT memories can cooperatively store and retrieve N-qubit entangled
states encoded in photon number, path, and polarization with near-unity
fidelity in the ideal limit. This work bridges a long-standing theoretical gap
and lays a solid foundation for the application of quantum memories in scalable
quantum networks and quantum information processing.

Abstract: We study temperature estimation using quantum probes, including single-mode
initial states and two-mode states generated via stimulated parametric
down-conversion in a nonlinear crystal at finite temperature. We explore both
transient and equilibrium regimes and compare the performance of Gaussian and
non-Gaussian probe states for temperature estimation. In the non-equilibrium
regime, we show that single-mode non-Gaussian probe states - such as Fock, odd
cat, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states - can significantly enhance the speed
of estimation, particularly at short interaction times. In the two-mode
setting, entangled states such as the two-mode squeezed vacuum, NOON state, and
entangled cat state can enable access to temperature information at much
earlier times. In the equilibrium regime, we analyze temperature estimation
using two-mode squeezed thermal states, which outperform single-mode
strategies. We evaluate practical measurements and find that both energy and
population difference observables yield optimal precision, while
quadrature-based measurements are suboptimal. The precision gain arises from
squeezing, which suppresses fluctuations in the population difference.

Result: 在弱对称性条件下成功识别出无退相干子系统，并展示了其在量子信息编码中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方案为在较弱对称性条件下实现无退相干量子信息处理提供了系统且高效的方法。

Abstract: We propose a generic and systematic decoherence-free scheme to encode quantum
information into an open quantum system based focusing on symmetry. Under a
given symmetry, the Liouville space is decomposed into invariant subspaces
characterized by a tensor-product structure. A decoherence-free subsystem is
then identified as a factor of the tensor product. Unlike decoherence-free
subspaces, which typically require strong symmetries, decoherence-free systems
are permitted under less restrictive weak symmetries. Specifically, we
primarily concern the permutation symmetry in conjunction with the unitary
symmetry and utilize the Schur-Weyl duality, which facilitates numerous
efficient and systematic calculations based on the well-established group
representation theory. Employing the isomorphism between the Liouville space
and the fictitious Hilbert space, we construct a super-Schur basis, which
block-diagonalizes the super-operators that describe the noisy quantum
channels, both in the Kraus representation and in terms of the quantum master
equation. Each block reveals the tensor-product structure and facilitates the
identification of physically relevant decoherence-free subsystems under the
specified weak symmetry.

Conclusion: 本文的解析方法为QSVT中的矩阵求逆提供了高效且最优的多项式构造方案，并提供了实用代码。

Abstract: Quantum matrix inversion with the quantum singular value transformation
(QSVT) requires a polynomial approximation to $1/x$. Several methods from the
literature construct polynomials that achieve the known degree complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa\log(\kappa/\varepsilon))$ with condition number $\kappa$
and uniform error $\varepsilon$. However, the \emph{optimal} polynomial with
lowest degree for fixed error $\varepsilon$ can only be approximated
numerically with the resource-intensive Remez method, leading to impractical
preprocessing runtimes. Here, we derive an analytic shortcut to the optimal
polynomial. Comparisons with other polynomials from the literature, based on
Taylor expansion, Chebyshev iteration, and convex optimization, confirm that
our result is optimal. Furthermore, for large $\kappa\log(\kappa/\varepsilon)$,
our polynomial has the smallest maximum value on $[-1,1]$ of all approaches
considered, leading to reduced circuit depth due to the normalization condition
of QSVT. With the Python code provided, this paper will also be useful for
practitioners in the field.

Abstract: Quantum information concepts and quantum technologies have opened the
prospect to probe quantum gravity in table-top experiments. Many proposals rely
on witnessing entanglement generation as a means to probe whether gravity is a
quantum channel. Here we formulate a different and conclusive indirect test of
the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction. Our witness is based on
the concept of verifiable quantum memory in the dynamics of a quantum system.
This allows us to assess the quantumness of an interaction between two systems
by local measurements on one subsystem only. Our approach enables the first
one-sided verification of the quantum nature of gravity, and provides a quantum
signature of the interaction that is not fully covered by existing proposals.
Our results open novel ways to witnessing the quantum nature of gravity in
table-top experiments and clarify how {decisive tests can be designed even with
measurements on only the probe system

Abstract: The research article studies the unconventional photon blockade effect in a
hybrid optomechanical system with an embedded spin-triplet state. The
interaction between the optomechanical system and the spin state generates new
transition paths for the destructive quantum interference of the two-photon
excitation state. By analytically solving the Schrodinger equation and
numerically simulating the master equation, it can be found that the modulated
mechanical dissipation is essential for achieving the strong photon blockade in
our system. Unlike the conventional cavity optomechanical system, the
second-order correlation function g(2)(0) =0 can be obtained with the weak
single-photon optomechanical coupling. By adjusting the system parameters, the
strong photon blockade and the single-photon resonance can coincide, which
indicates the hybrid system has the potential to be a high-quality and
efficient single-photon source. Finally, the influence of the thermal noise on
photon blockade is investigated. The results show that the second-order
correlation function is more robust for the weaker phonon-spin coupling.

Abstract: Recently, a new interesting concept of reverse uncertainty relation is
introduced. Different from the normal uncertainty relation, the reverse one
indicates that one cannot only prepare quantum states with joint small
uncertainty, but also with joint great uncertainty for incompatible
observables. We in this work construct a new quantum-control-assisted reverse
uncertainty relation and investigate the corresponding dynamic evolution in the
Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The obtained relation
indicates that the reverse uncertainty can be broken with help of the quantum
control system. The dynamic investigation reveals that there exists an
interesting single-value relationship between new uncertainty relation and the
mixedness of the system, indicating that the tightness and upper bound of the
uncertainty relation can be written as functional form of the mixedness. By
comparing the existing research in [Physica Scripta 2023, 98(6), 065113], we
show that the single-value relationship with the mixedness is the common nature
of both the normal uncertainty relations and the reverse uncertainty relation.

Method: 通过对称量子反馈控制，分析X态量子不和谐度的变化，并研究矩阵元素的演化机制。

Result: 量子不和谐度从0提升至0.38，并在降低原子衰减率后继续上升。反馈机制将矩阵限制为3*3子空间，抑制贝尔态退化。

Conclusion: 对称量子反馈控制能有效提升量子不和谐度，并提出改进反馈哈密顿量的方向。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of a symmetric quantum feedback control on the
quantum discord of the X state in V-shaped plasmonic waveguides. Under this
feedback, the quantum discord of the Werner state is enhanced from 0 to 0.38.
This value even continues to rise after reducing the decay rate of the atoms.
Furthermore, we get the operational mechanism of feedback control through the
evolution of the matrix elements. It confines the initial 4 * 4 matrix into a 3
* 3 subspace. As a result, the weights of each ground state in the quantum
state change, which suppresses the degradation of Bell state. Lastly, we
propose a direction for suggesting an improved feedback Hamiltonian.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum kicked rotor in the
near-resonant regime and observe a particular recurring cusp caustic of the
wave functions' accumulation. We then derive the path integral expression of
the quantum evolution and analytically determine the conditions for the caustic
formation and recurring period. A scaling power law with Arnold index of $1/4$
relating to the wave amplitude enhancement depending on the kicking strength as
well as the resonant detuning parameter, has been derived and verified. We also
discuss classical-quantum correspondence of the caustics and find that chaos
can disrupt the phase matching leading to the destruction of the caustic
structure. Finally, possible experimental observations and some implications of
these findings are discussed.

Abstract: We establish a strong converse bound for the private classical capacity of
anti-degradable quantum channels. Specifically, we prove that this capacity is
zero whenever the error $\epsilon > 0$ and privacy parameter $\delta > 0$
satisfy the inequality $\delta (1-\epsilon^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}+\epsilon
(1-\delta^2)^{\frac{1}{2}}<1$. This result strengthens previous understandings
by sharply defining the boundary beyond which reliable and private
communication is impossible. Furthermore, we present a ``pretty simple'' proof
of the ``pretty strong'' converse for the quantum capacity of anti-degradable
channels, valid for any error $\epsilon < \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Our approach
offers clarity and technical simplicity, shedding new light on the fundamental
limits of quantum communication.

Abstract: Cluster states, as highly entangled multi-qubit states, are widely used as
essential resources for quantum communication and quantum computing. However,
due to the diverse requirements of applications for cluster states with
specific entanglement structures, a universal generation protocol is still
lacking. Here we develop a matrix representation according to the
characteristics of time-delayed feedback (TDF) and propose a protocol for
generating arbitrary cluster states with multiple TDFs. The matrix
representation also allows us to optimize the generation process to reduce TDF
usage, thus improving efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate a
tree-cluster-state generation process that requires only one TDF. Moreover,
accounting for the critical loss mechanisms and imperfections in our protocol,
we discuss the additional losses caused by multiple TDFs and evaluate the
fidelity of the resulting cluster states.

Conclusion: 论文通过多个例子展示了辛相干性的操作相关性，并揭示了协方差矩阵作为虚拟量子态密度矩阵的概念意义。

Abstract: The interdependence of position and momentum, as highlighted by the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, is a cornerstone of quantum physics. Yet,
position-momentum correlations have received little systematic attention.
Motivated by recent developments in bosonic quantum physics that underscore
their relevance in quantum thermodynamics, metrology, and computing, we
establish a general framework to study and quantify position-momentum
correlations in quantum states. We introduce symplectic coherence, a faithful
and easily computable measure defined as the Frobenius norm of the block of the
covariance matrix encoding position-momentum correlations, and demonstrate that
symplectic coherence is monotone under relevant operations and robust under
small perturbations. Furthermore, using a recent mapping by Barthe et al.
(Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 070604) which relates the covariance matrix of a bosonic
state to the density matrix of a finite-dimensional system, we show that
position-momentum correlations correspond to beyond-classical correlations in a
virtual finite-dimensional quantum state, with symplectic coherence mapping
naturally to geometric quantum discord. Taking energy constraints into account,
we determine the maximal position-momentum correlations achievable at fixed
energy, revealing structural insights about the corresponding optimal states.
Finally, we illustrate the operational relevance of symplectic coherence
through several examples in quantum information tasks and quantum
thermodynamics. In the process, we establish new technical results on matrix
norms and quantum covariance matrices, and demonstrate the conceptual
significance of viewing covariance matrices as density matrices of virtual
quantum states.

Conclusion: 该算法具有确定性、低深度操作和可扩展性，适合硬件实现，并支持部分数据库搜索，扩展了应用范围。

Abstract: We introduce a novel deterministic quantum search algorithm that provides a
practical alternative to conventional probabilistic search approaches. Our
scheme eliminates the inherent uncertainty of quantum search without relying on
arbitrary phase rotations, a key limitation of other deterministic methods. The
algorithm achieves certainty by recursively expanding the base oracle so that
it marks all states prefixed by the same two bits as the target, encompassing
exactly one-quarter of the search space. This enables a step-by-step reduction
of the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The
algorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of
$O(N^{\log_2(3)/2}) \approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's
$O(\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$. Our approach relies exclusively
on two-qubit nearest-neighbour diffusion operators, avoiding global diffusion
entirely. We show that, despite the increased query complexity, this design
reduces the total number of two-qubit gates required for diffusion by more than
an order of magnitude for search spaces up to at least 18 qubits, with even
greater advantages on hardware with limited qubit connectivity. The scheme's
inherent determinism, reliance on simple nearest-neighbour, low-depth
operations, and scalable recursive structure make it well-suited for hardware
implementation. Additionally, we show that the algorithm naturally supports
partial database search, enabling deterministic identification of selected
target bits without requiring a full search, further broadening its
applicability.

readout of up to 25 internal levels, thus forming a 25-dimensional qudit. By
probing superpositions of up to 24 states, we investigate how errors scale with
qudit dimension $d$ and identify the primary error sources affecting quantum
coherence. Additionally, we demonstrate high-dimensional qudit operations by
implementing a 3-qubit Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and a 4-qubit Toffoli gate
with a single ion. Our findings suggest that quantum computing architectures
based on large-dimensional qudits hold significant promise.

Conclusion: 量子Mpemba效应在量子制冷机中存在，且受系统与热浴耦合影响。

Abstract: We consider the qubit-qutrit model of self-contained quantum refrigerator and
observe the quantum Mpemba effect in its cooling. In this system, the qutrit
acts as the refrigerator while the qubit is to be cooled. The entire system is
coupled to three bosonic heat baths, due to which the dynamics of the system is
governed by a Gorini-Kossakoswski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. We
investigate the Liouvillian that generates the dynamics of the system and find
that it has a block diagonal form. The dynamics of each element of the system's
density matrix can be determined by solving the dynamical equation of the
corresponding block that contains it. We find that the steady state belongs to
the block containing only the diagonal elements in the energy basis. We
numerically solve for the steady state and investigate the steady-state cooling
over a significant region of the parameter space. Moreover, we demonstrate the
quantum Mpemba effect in the refrigerator: a Mpemba state obtained by applying
a unitary on the equilibrium state of the system reaches the steady state
faster than the equilibrium state, despite the Mpemba state being initially
farther away from the steady state. The Mpemba state thus leads to an
acceleration in cooling of the cold qubit. We also find that both local and
global unitaries on the qubit-qutrit system can generate the Mpemba state.
Finally, we study the effect of the qubit-qutrit couplings and the system-bath
couplings on the Mpemba effect.

Abstract: Combining quantum sensing with quantum computing can lead to quantum
computational sensors that are able to more efficiently extract task-specific
information from physical signals than is possible otherwise. Early examples of
quantum computational sensing (QCS) have largely focused on protocols where
only a single sensing operation appears before measurement -- with an exception
being the recent application of Grover's algorithm to signal detection. In this
paper we present, in theory and numerical simulations, the application of two
quantum algorithms -- quantum signal processing and quantum neural networks --
to various binary and multiclass machine-learning classification tasks in
sensing. Here sensing operations are interleaved with computing operations,
giving rise to nonlinear functions of the sensed signals. We have evaluated
tasks based on static and time-varying signals, including spatiotemporal
signals. Our approach to optimizing the circuit parameters in a QCS protocol
takes into account quantum sampling noise and allows us to engineer protocols
that can yield accurate results with as few as just a single measurement shot.
In all cases, we have been able to show a regime of operation where a quantum
computational sensor can achieve higher accuracy than a conventional quantum
sensor, with a simulated accuracy advantage of $>$20 percentage points for some
tasks. We also present protocols for performing nonlinear tasks using
Hamiltonian-engineered bosonic systems and quantum signal processing with
hybrid qubit-bosonic systems. Overall, we have shown that substantial quantum
computational-sensing advantages can be obtained even if the quantum system is
small, including few-qubit systems, systems comprising a single qubit and a
single bosonic mode, and even just a single qubit alone -- raising the
prospects for experimental proof-of-principle and practical realizations.

Abstract: Percolation theory serves as a cornerstone for studying phase transitions and
critical phenomena, with broad implications in statistical physics, materials
science, and complex networks. However, most machine learning frameworks for
percolation analysis have focused on two-dimensional systems, oversimplifying
the spatial correlations and morphological complexity of real-world
three-dimensional materials. To bridge this gap and improve label efficiency
and scalability in 3D systems, we propose a Siamese Neural Network (SNN) that
leverages features of the largest cluster as discriminative input. Our method
achieves high predictive accuracy for both site and bond percolation thresholds
and critical exponents in three dimensions, with sub-1% error margins using
significantly fewer labeled samples than traditional approaches. This work
establishes a robust and data-efficient framework for modeling high-dimensional
critical phenomena, with potential applications in materials discovery and
complex network analysis.

Abstract: Nonreciprocity breaks the symmetry between forward and backward propagation,
giving rise to a range of peculiar wave phenomena. In this work, we investigate
Anderson localization in higher-dimensional nonreciprocal lattices. Focusing on
the two-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model, we uncover anisotropic hybrid modes
(HMs) that exhibit skin localization along one direction and Anderson
localization along the other. We determine the Anderson transition along
different directions via the transfer matrix approach and finite-size scaling
of Lyapunov exponents. This allows us to map out mobility edges that separate
HMs from normal skin modes and Anderson localized modes (ALMs), revealing an
ALM-HM-ALM reentrant transition. Our analysis extends to arbitrary dimensions,
and we demonstrate the existence of skin-Anderson transitions on the
infinite-dimensional nonreciprocal Bethe lattice using the forward-scattering
approximation.

Abstract: The formation of quantized vortices is a unifying feature of quantum
mechanical systems, making it a premier means for fundamental and comparative
studies of different quantum fluids. Being excited states of motion, vortices
are normally unstable towards relaxation into lower energy states. However,
here we exploit the driven-dissipative nature of polaritonic fluids of light to
create stationary, multiply charged vortices. We measure the spectrum of
collective excitations and observe negative energy modes at the core and
positive energy modes at large radii. Their coexistence at the same frequency
normally causes the dynamical instability, but here intrinsic losses stabilize
the system, allowing for phase pinning by the pump on macroscopic scales. We
observe common features of quantized vortices in quantum fluids and other
rotating geometries like astrophysical compact objects, opening the way to the
study of universal amplification phenomena.

Abstract: The interference patterns of ultracold atoms, observed after ballistic
expansion from optical lattices, encode essential information about strongly
correlated lattice systems, including phase coherence and non-local
correlations. While the interference of lattice bosons has been extensively
investigated, quantitative studies of the lattice fermion interference remain
challenging. Here, we report the observation and quantitative characterization
of interference patterns in low-temperature, homogeneous fermionic Hubbard
gases. We develop a novel method to extract first-order correlations from
interference patterns, which directly reflect the short-range phase coherence
of lattice fermions. Mapping the nearest-neighbor correlations as a function of
lattice filling and interaction strength, we observe a crossover from a metal
to a Mott insulator. Moreover, at half filling, the measured correlations agree
well with quantum Monte Carlo calculations and remain finite in the regime of
strong repulsion, revealing virtual tunneling processes driven by quantum
fluctuations.

Abstract: Ultracold gases of dipolar molecules have long been envisioned as a platform
for the realization of novel quantum phases. Recent advances in collisional
shielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the
creation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein
condensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases
in ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has
so far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound
droplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar
sodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions
with controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which
interactions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude,
we prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing
a transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating
two-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times
higher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and
suggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work
establishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly
dipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized
crystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices.

Result: 异相调制破坏L=6对称性，而同相调制保持高对称性并激发更高阶模式。SOC诱导的对称性破缺导致法拉第图案无需初始噪声即可形成。

Conclusion: 通过调制频率可控制图案对称性、径向节点和半径，为量子流体动力学操控提供了新方法。

Abstract: We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven,
pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared
with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using $in$-$phase$ and
$out$-$of$-$phase$ protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with
distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation
frequency, $out$-$of$-$phase$ modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern,
whereas $in$-$phase$ modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also
excites higher-order modes (L $\ge $ 6). Unlike conventional binary BECs,
Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry
breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore,
we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius
by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating
quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring
supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.

Conclusion: 随机扰动方法的选择（能量守恒或Casimir守恒）对解的分布和峰值行为有显著影响。

Abstract: We introduce a stochastic perturbation of the Camassa-Holm equation such
that, unlike previous formulations, energy is conserved by the stochastic flow.
We compare this to a complementary approach which preserves Casimirs of the
Poisson bracket. Through an energy preserving numerical implementation of the
model, we study the influence of noise on the well-known 'peakon' formation
behaviour of the solution. The energy conserving stochastic approach generates
an ensemble of solutions which are spread around the deterministic Camassa-Holm
solution, whereas the Casimir conserving alternative develops peakons which may
propagate away from the deterministic solution more dramatically.

Abstract: Driving a quantum system out of equilibrium while preserving its subtle
quantum mechanical correlations on large scales presents a major challenge,
both fundamentally and for technological applications. At its core, this
challenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at
asymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this
work, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These
fermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two
topologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a
microscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh
field theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with
hydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key
feature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity
of the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We
quantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion
around the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first
non-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection
mechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation,
suggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum
phenomena in fermionic systems.

Conclusion: 随机重置位置对搜索策略有显著影响，不同分布会导致不同的最优策略，表现为重置率的平滑变化或不连续性。

Abstract: Brownian diffusion subject to stochastic resetting to a fixed position has
been widely studied for applications to random search processes. In an
unbounded domain, the mean first passage time at a target site can be minimized
for a convenient choice of the resetting rate. Here we study this optimization
problem in one dimension when resetting occurs to random positions, chosen from
a distribution with compact support that does not include the target. Depending
on the shape of this distribution, the optimal resetting rate either varies
smoothly with the mean distance to the target, as in single-site resetting, or
exhibits a discontinuity caused by the presence of a second local minimum in
the mean first passage time. These two regimes are separated by a critical line
containing a singular point that we characterize through a Ginzburg-Landau
theory. To quantify how useful a given resetting position is for a search
process, we calculate the distribution of the last resetting position before
absorption. The discontinuous transition above separates two markedly different
optimal strategies: one with a small resetting rate where the last path before
absorption starts from a rather distant but likely position, while the other
strategy has a large resetting rate, favoring last paths starting from
not-so-likely points but which are closer to the target.

Abstract: The electric double layer (EDL) that forms at the interface between metals
and ionic solutions is at the heart of various energy technologies. Recent
experimental data have challenged our traditional understanding of the EDL
charging behavior, which is based on mean-field Gouy-Chapman-Stern-type (GCS)
models. In this article, we present a classical theory for the EDL, derived
from first-principles statistical mechanics, that accounts for electron-ion
correlation effects using the method of image charges and systematically
extends beyond the mean-field level. Such electron-ion correlations introduce
an additional interaction between the metal surface and electrolyte ions,
significantly altering the EDL structure. Our theory, valid in the limit of
dilute electrolyte solutions and weakly charged metal surfaces, achieves
quantitative agreement with experimental capacitance data across a wide range
of electrode materials and electrolyte solvents, and thus resolves
long-standing questions on the origin of discrepancies to GCS predictions.
Thereby, the framework conceptually unifies the processes of double-layer
charging and ion adsorption (electrosorption), which are typically considered
as distinct phenomena, but are shown to be manifestations of the same
fundamental electrostatic principles.

Abstract: Entropy production quantifies the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in
non-equilibrium systems. Here, we develop a direct method to obtain closed,
tractable expressions for entropy production in a broad class of dynamical
density functional theories, from Dean's exact stochastic equation for
microscopic densities to coarse-grained fluctuating-hydrodynamics models with
density-dependent mobility. The method employs an Onsager-Machlup path-integral
formulation. Our results reproduce particle-level calculations and matches
recent Doi-Peliti treatments, confirming that the irregular noise structure of
Dean's equation poses no obstacle when handled consistently. We further extend
the framework to active mixtures with non-reciprocal interactions and to
run-and-tumble or active-Brownian suspensions, generalizations that require a
careful treatment of the spurious-drift. Our method furnishes a practical route
to quantify irreversibility in density functional field theories and paves the
way for systematic studies of entropy production in multi-field active fluids
that couple density, momentum and orientation.

Conclusion: 结果调和了退火和无序模型中钉扎转变点是否一致的不同观点。

Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional model of a fluctuating
interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is
described by the $N$-step directed 1D random walk on a discrete half-line $m
\ge 0$, and the interaction with the wall is modeled by a quenched
site-dependent short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j=1,...,N$) located at
$m=0$, with distribution $Q(u_j)$. By computing the first two moments, $\la G_N
\ra$ and $\la G_N^2 \ra$, of the partition function $G_N$ averaged over the
disorder, we show that the pinning transition for $\la G_N^2 \ra$ may or may
not coincide with that of $\la G_N \ra$, depending on the details of the
disorder distribution $Q(u_j)$. This result reconciles opposite viewpoints on
whether the pinning transition points in models with annealed and quenched
disorder coincide or not.

Abstract: We studied the thermodynamic quantities and the probability distribution,
expressing the probability distribution as a function of the energy, in the
canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics, which is
characterized by the entropic parameter $q$, with the conventional expectation
value. We treat the power-law-like distribution. The equilibrium temperature,
which is often called the physical temperature, is employed to describe the
probability distribution. The Tsallis statistics represented by the equilibrium
temperature was applied to $N$ harmonic oscillators, where $N$ is the number of
the oscillators. The expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the
heat capacity were obtained. The expressions of these quantities and the
expression of the probability distribution were obtained when the differences
between adjacent energy levels are the same. These quantities and the
distributions were numerically calculated. The $q$ dependences of the energy,
the R\'enyi entropy, and the heat capacity are weak. In contrast, the Tsallis
entropy depends on $q$. The probability distribution as a function of the
energy depends on $N$ and $q$.

Abstract: We study the optimal performance of an information engine consisting of an
overdamped Brownian bead confined in a controllable, $d$-dimensional harmonic
trap and additionally subjected to gravity. The trap's center is updated
dynamically via a feedback protocol designed such that no external work is done
by the trap on the bead, while maximizing the extraction of gravitational
potential energy and achieving directed motion. We show that performance
strikingly improves when thermal fluctuations in directions perpendicular to
gravity are harnessed. This improvement arises from feedback cooling of these
transverse degrees of freedom, along which all heat is extracted; comparable
performance can be achieved even without vertical measurements. This engine
design modularizes the functions of harnessing fluctuations and storing free
energy, drawing a close analogy to the Szilard engine.

annealing machine. However, its applicability remains unclear. Therefore, we
evaluated the performance of the hybrid method on large-size Ising models and
analyzed its characteristics. The results indicate that the hybrid method
improves upon solutions obtained by the preprocessing SA, even if the Ising
models cannot be embedded in the quantum annealing machine. We analyzed the
method from three perspectives: preprocessing, spin-fixed sub-Ising model
generation method, and the accuracy of the quantum annealing machine. From the
viewpoint of the minimum energy gap, we found that solving the sub-Ising model
with a quantum annealing machine results in a higher solution accuracy than
solving the original Ising model. Additionally, we demonstrated that the number
of fixed spins and the accuracy of the quantum annealing machine affect the
dependency of the solution accuracy on the sub-Ising model size.

Conclusion: 理论预测为实验验证提供了新方向，支持模型的适用性。

Abstract: We revisit the modeling framework introduced in [N. Loy and L. Preziosi:
Bull. Math. Bio., 85, 2023] to describe the dynamics of cell orientation under
cyclic stretch. We propose a reformulation based on the principles of
Stochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables introduced in [T. Leadbetter,
P. Purohit, and C. Reina: PNAS Nexus, 2, 2023]. This approach allows us to
describe not only the evolution of the orientation distribution, but also the
observed spreading phenomenon. The insight provided by our model reveals an
interesting phenomenon, which we call two-stage reorientation: when cells begin
aligned with an energy maximum, their orientations spread before concentrating
at the energy minimum. This theoretical prediction suggests a new experiment to
test this modeling framework.

Motivation: 解决磁性表面自旋取向及其调控的技术难题，特别是在强关联系统NiO中，传统模型无法解释应变驱动的SRT现象。

Conclusion: 新模型为理解SRT提供了理论支持，并提出了通过电场调控SRT的创新方法，为磁性薄膜的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We address the technologically important issue of the spin orientation on a
correlated magnetic surface and how to manipulate it. We consider a
prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, and show that a single particle
approach with anisotropic hoppings, or even a many-electron model with a scalar
Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$ fails to explain the strain driven spin
reorientation transition (SRT). We set up a model treating both anisotropic
single particle effects and orbital-dependent, full multipole electron-electron
interaction effects at the same footing. Within this model, predictive power to
explain the observed SRT is regained and the results indicate the novel
possibility of using an electric field to control SRT in magnetic films grown
on piezoelectric substrates.

Conclusion: 研究为无间隙基态的MERA网络提供了精确可解模型，扩展了张量网络的应用范围。

Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of
quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their
entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks
themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they
describe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for
gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected
entangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from
numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However,
for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement
renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so
far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA
intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for
MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent
networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously
constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains,
which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The
hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS
alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation
function and critical exponents.

Result: 观察到理论预测的螺旋流，并通过基态中的纠缠哈密顿量重构了边界CCFT谱。

Conclusion: 张量网络是捕捉弱一级相变近似共形不变性的有效方法。

Abstract: The quantum $5$-state Potts model is known to possess a perturbative
description using complex conformal field theory (CCFT), the analytic
continuation of ``theory space" to a complex plane. To study the corresponding
complex fixed point on the lattice, the model must be deformed by an additional
non-Hermitian term due to its complex coefficient $\lambda$. Although the
variational principle breaks down in this case, we demonstrate that tensor
network algorithms are still capable of simulating these non-Hermitian
theories. We access system sizes up to $L = 28$, which enable the observation
of the theoretically predicted spiral flow of the running couplings. Moreover,
we reconstruct the full boundary CCFT spectrum through the entanglement
Hamiltonian encoded in the ground state. Our work demonstrates how tensor
networks are the correct approach to capturing the approximate conformal
invariance of weakly first-order phase transitions.

Result: 发现反铁磁相变时的特征能带位移，以及一个无法通过DFT+U计算解释的结构，表明多体相互作用的影响。

Conclusion: NiPS3的反铁磁相变涉及复杂的多体相互作用，DFT+U计算不足以完全描述其行为，与MnPS3和FePS3不同。

Abstract: NiPS3 is an exfoliable van-der-Waals intralayer antiferromagnet with
zigzag-type spin arrangement. It is distinct from other TMPS3 (TM: transition
metal) materials by optical excitations into a strongly correlated state that
is tied to the magnetic properties. However, the related, fundamental band
structure across the antiferromagnetic phase transition has not been probed
yet. Here, we use angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with {\mu}m
resolution in combination with DFT+U calculations for that purpose. We identify
a characteristic band shift across TN. It is attributed to bands of mixed Ni
and S character related to the superexchange interaction of Ni 3t2g orbitals.
Moreover, we find a structure above the valence band maximum with little
angular dispersion that could not be reproduced by the calculations. The
discrepancy suggests the influence of many-body interactions beyond the DFT+U
approximations in striking contrast to the results on MnPS3 and FePS3, where
these calculations were sufficient for an adequate description.

magnetic structures of YCo$_5$ and NdCo$_5$. From neutron diffraction patterns
in a wide range of temperatures between 3 K and 800 K, we obtain the thermal
coefficient expansion and the magnetic moment values for the latter two
materials. For SmCo$_5$, we fit existing neutron spectroscopy data with a model
recently used for NdCo$_5$ to obtain the crystal field parameters, which are
essential to determine the low-lying energy scales that set the Hamiltonian.
Our results may trigger new experimental and theoretical studies towards a new
route for the realization of permanent magnets.

Conclusion: 磁晶各向异性在Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$的长程磁序中起关键作用，短程磁序在高温下仍表现出各向异性。

Abstract: We report a detailed high-field/high-frequency ferromagnetic resonance
(HF-FMR) study of low-energy magnon excitations in the van der Waals
ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. At 2 K, the field dependence of the magnon branches
is well described by a semiclassical domain-based model, from which we extract
key microscopic parameters including the anisotropy gap $\Delta = 170\pm 4$
GHz, the anisotropy field $B_{\rm A} = 5.85\pm 0.08$ T, and the effective
$g$-factor $g_{\rm ab}\simeq g_{\rm c} = 2.07(4)$. Furthermore the uniaxial
anisotropy constant was determined to be $K = (10.5\pm 0.23) \times 10^{-6}$
erg/cm$^3$. Anisotropic short-range magnetic order persists above $T_{\rm C}$
up to approximately 270 K, as evidenced by a finite anisotropy gap and
anisotropic shifts in the FMR resonance fields. Both results clearly show the
presence of anisotropic local magnetic fields well above $T_{\rm C}$. Our
findings underscore the crucial role of magneto-crystalline anisotropy in
driving long-range magnetic order in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$.

Conclusion: 动态电荷条纹抑制了RKKY间接交换，导致DyB12中磁相多样性和蝴蝶型各向异性。

Abstract: The origin of charge transport and magnetization anisotropy was studied in
DyB12, an antiferromagnetic (AF) metal with Neel temperature TN = 16.3 K that
exhibits both cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions of the fcc crystal structure
and nanoscale electronic instabilities (dynamic charge stripes). Based on the
results obtained the magnetic field (H) vs temperature (T) phase diagrams have
been constructed. Moreover, from angle dependent magnetoresistance and
magnetization measurements the butterfly-type patterns of the H-phi magnetic
phase diagram in the (110) plane were created, which include a number of
different magnetic phases separated from each other by radial and circular
boundaries. Several positive and negative contributions to magnetoresistance
were separated and analyzed, providing arguments in favor of the important role
of the spin density wave 5d-component in the magnetic structure of AF state. We
argue that charge fluctuations in stripes are responsible for the suppression
of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) indirect exchange between the
nearest neighbored Dy3+ ions located along the same 110 directions, as these
dynamic charge stripes produce the magnetic phase diversity and the
butterfly-type anisotropy in DyB12.

Conclusion: 提出了利用超冷原子实验实现DTC和MBT的方案，揭示了DTC相的非热性质。

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain
driven by a periodic magnetic field. Based on its instantaneous integrability
and inherent symmetry, we analytically study the magnetization and many-body
tunneling (MBT). Both of them exhibit periodicity distinct from the driving
period. The magnetization is shown to be independent of the initial state and
robust against perturbations, signaling the formation of discrete time crystal
(DTC) order. The DTC phase is found to be continuously tunable through magnetic
field. The system exhibits perfect MBT, manifested as exactly vanishing
Loschmidt echo (LE) thus divergent LE rate function at half period of the DTC.
Remarkably, the perfect MBT is independent of the system size, and can be
traced to an effective gap closure induced by quantum geometric effects.
Furthermore, the Loschmidt echo spectra entropy shows logarithmic-dependence on
system size, consistent with non-thermal nature of the DTC phase. We propose a
protocol using ultracold atoms for experimental realization of the DTC and MBT.

Conclusion: 带间有序和自旋轨道耦合模型为实验现象提供了合理解释，挑战了对正常态的现有理解。

Abstract: Recent experiments on the kagome metal Cs$_3$Sb$_5$ reveal a curious phase
transition-like feature: a nematic magnetic torque response that abruptly sets
in at $T_\tau \approx 130$~K, above the known charge density wave transition at
$T_\text{CDW} \approx 100$~K. Counterintuitively, elastoresistance
measurements--a standard probe of nematicity--show no corresponding signal,
ruling out a nematic phase transition and placing strong constraints on
possible explanations. Beyond nematicity, the torque is paramagnetic for
in-plane magnetic field, while above a critical out-of-plane field, an in-plane
magnetisation appears, accompanied by hysteresis. We show that this combination
of features cannot be accounted for by charge density waves or intraband
magnetic order. Instead, we propose that interband ordering--via a
symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling and a time-reversal and spatial
symmetry-breaking interband order parameter--together with a background strain
field, consistent with typical experimental conditions, provides a natural
explanation; in our picture, the behaviour at $T_\tau$ is understood as a
crossover in the symmetry-allowed interband spin-orbit coupling strength. Our
theory accounts for the nematic magnetic torque, hysteresis, and the
transition-like onset at $T_\tau$, while also making testable predictions,
including strain-induced magnetisation. In doing so, it challenges the
prevailing view of the normal state.

Abstract: We report the synthesis, crystal structure and magnetic properties of the

(4-(6-(1,10-phenanthrolin-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)methyl
pivalate) ($\mathbf{1}$). Complex $\mathbf{1}$ is shown to exhibit
field-induced slow relaxation of the magnetisation at $B = 0.1\,\mathrm{T}$ via
two distinct relaxation paths. Using tunable high-frequency/high-field electron
paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we experimentally determine the effective
$g$-factors and zero field splittings of the two energetically lowest Kramers
doublets (KD). Our data reveal that the triply-capped, slightly distorted
trigonal-prismatic ligand field favours an $m \simeq \pm 9/2$ magnetic ground
state, while the main contribution to the first excited KD at $\Delta_{1
\rightarrow 2} = 780(5)\,\mathrm{GHz}$ is suggested to be $m \simeq \pm 5/2$.
The ground state $g$-tensor has generally axial form but hosts significant
transversal components, which we conclude to be the source of SMM-silent
behaviour in zero field. Our findings are backed up by ab-initio spin-orbit
configuration interaction calculations showing excellent agreement with the
experimental data.

Abstract: Electronic systems with quadratic band touchings, commonly found in two- and
three-dimensional materials such as Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, kagome
metals, HgTe, and pyrochlore iridates, have attracted significant interest
concerning the role of interactions in shaping their electronic properties.
However, even in the simplest model of spinless fermions on a two-dimensional
checkerboard lattice, the quantum phase diagram as a function of
nearest-neighbor interaction remains under debate. We employ constrained-path
quantum Monte Carlo simulations (CP-QMC) simulations to investigate the problem
using a two-dimensional torus geometry. We cross-validate our results on small
lattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group
calculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an
improved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the
identification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in
tensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to
Hartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to
establish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice
rotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our
results show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the
checkerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three
interaction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator
at weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and
a site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.

Abstract: The ability to non-dissipatively tune the Josephson coupling energy of
Josephson junctions is a useful tool in frequency-tunable qubits. This is
typically done by threading magnetic flux through two junctions connected in a
loop, a geometry that exposes the qubit to magnetic environmental noise. In
this paper, we show that by biasing a junction with supercurrent from a
separate pair of superconducting leads coupled to the device, the Josephson
energy can be tuned without the need for a flux loop. Our multiterminal device
may enable the realization of a frequency-tunable qubit with greatly reduced
susceptibility to flux noise.

Abstract: In the present work we theoretically analyze electroluminescence occurring in
a biased single-molecule junction with a chiral bridge imitated by a helical
chain. We show that optical transitions between electron states of the chiral
linker may result in the emission of circular polarized light whose handedness
depends on both direction of propagation and the polarity of the bias voltage
provided that the coupling between the bridge sites is sufficiently strong. The
mechanism controlling this specific light emission does not depend on the
magnetic moments and spin-orbit interactions. It rather relies on the chiral
properties of the bridge molecule and on the distribution of the bias voltage
between the electrodes in the junction.

Abstract: The investigation of magnetic solitons often relies on numerical modeling to
determine key features such as stability, annihilation, nucleation, and motion.
However, as soliton sizes approach atomic length scales, the accuracy of these
predictions become increasingly sensitive to the details of the numerical
model. Here, we study the annihilation of two-dimensional magnetic skyrmions
using a pseudospectral approach and compare its performance to that of
conventional micromagnetic simulations. A central distinction between the
models lies in their treatment of the exchange interaction, which governs the
magnon dispersion relation and plays a crucial role to balance the uniaxial
anisotropy to stabilise skyrmions. We demonstrate that both the choice of model
and spatial discretisation significantly influence the skyrmion dynamics and
the magnetic field required for annihilation. The pseudospectral model provides
a consistent description across length scales and captures complex behaviours
such as skyrmion breathing on its path to annihilation. Our results have direct
implications in the state-of-the-art modeling of skyrmions and other
two-dimensional textures and will impact the modeling of three-dimensional
textures such as hopfions.

Abstract: Engineering moir\'e superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures provides
fundamental control over emergent electronic, structural, and optical
properties allowing to affect topological and correlated phenomena. This
control is achieved through imposed periodic modulation of potentials and
targeted modifications of symmetries. For twisted bilayers of van der Waals
materials with rectangular lattices, such as PdSe2, this work shows that
one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e patterns emerge universally. This emergence is
driven by a series of critical twist angles (CAs). We investigate the geometric
origins of these unique 1D moir\'e patterns and develop a universal
mathematical framework to predict the CAs in twisted rectangular lattices.
Through a density functional theory (DFT) description of the electronic
properties of twisted bilayer PdSe2, we further reveal directionally localized
flat band structures, localized charge densities and strong spin-orbit coupling
along the dispersive direction which points to the emergence of an effectively
1D strongly spin-orbit coupled electronic systems. This establishes twisted
rectangular systems as a unique platform for engineering low-symmetry moir\'e
patterns, low-dimensional strongly correlated and topological physics, and
spatially selective quantum phases beyond the isotropic paradigms of hexagonal
moir\'e materials.

Abstract: Superfluids under specific conditions can exhibit spontaneous breaking of
continuous translation symmetries and form exotic spatially ordered states of
matter known as supersolids. Despite its early theoretical prediction, it took
over half-a-centrury to experimentally demonstrate the supersolid phase in
ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, forming due to long-range
interatomic interactions. Here we propose as a promising new platform for
supersolidity exciton-polariton superfluids, confined in annular optically
induced traps. The supersolid phase emerges due to effective attractive
interactions, mediated by the normal excitonic component of the system.
Experimental demonstration of spontaneously formed spatially ordered phase is
in agreement with detailed mean-field theoretical analysis and numerical
simulation. The spontaneous character of the observed supersolid transition is
further evidenced by the formation of specific zero-energy Nambu-Goldstone
modes in the collective excitation spectrum.

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), an emergent phenomenon in
noncentrosymmetric systems, enables the generation of a transverse voltage
without an external magnetic field through a second-order electrical response.
However, achieving a sizable NLHE signal remains a critical challenge for its
application in frequency-doubling and rectifying devices. Here, we report a
light-induced giant enhancement of the NLHE in the two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) at the CaZrO3/KTaO3 (111) interface. Under light illumination, the
second harmonic Hall voltage (V2{\omega} y) increases substantially and
undergoes a sign reversal. Correspondingly,the second-order transverse
conductivity increases by nearly five orders of magnitude, reaching 2.4 um V-1
omega-1, while also reversing its sign. Scaling analysis indicates that skew
scattering is the dominant mechanism underlying the NLHE and is highly tunable
via optical gating. Photoexcitation pumps electrons from in-gap states into the
higher-lying Ta 5d conduction band, generating high-mobility photocarriers that
significantly increase the cubic transport scattering time, thereby driving a
dramatic enhancement of {\sigma}(2) yxx. First-principles calculations further
reveal that the Berry curvature distribution on the Fermi surface strongly
depends on band filling. As the Fermi level approaches a band crossing in the
Ta 5d subband near the M point, the Berry curvature triple undergoes a sign
change, accounting for the experimentally observed sign reversal of the
nonlinear Hall response. Our work offers a new strategy to optically boost and
tune the nonlinear Hall effect in oxide 2DEG systems, paving the way for
applications in light-controlled rectification and nonlinear electronic
devices.

Result: 通过δ函数或谐波驱动成功诱导出同时包含I、II和III型Dirac点的Dirac半金属。

Conclusion: 该研究为探索新型Dirac半金属提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Dirac semimetals are classified into types I, II, and III based on the
topological charge of their Dirac points. If a three-dimensional (3D) system
can be sliced into a family of $k_z$-dependent normal and topological
insulators, type I Dirac points separate a 2D normal insulator from a 2D
first-order topological insulator, while type II (III) Dirac points separate a
2D normal (first-order) insulator from a 2D second-order topological insulator.
To investigate the effects arising from the interplay of distinct Dirac points,
one may wonder whether these Dirac points can coexist in single system. Here,
we propose a scheme to induce composite Dirac semimetals in a Floquet four-band
system with time-reversal and space-inversion symmetries. A general description
is established to characterize Dirac semimetals in Floquet systems. The results
show that Dirac semimetals hosting coexisting type I, II, and III Dirac points
can be induced by delta-function or harmonic driving. Our results provide a
promising new avenue for exploring novel Dirac semimetals.

Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a
small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian
substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be
engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and
is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature
dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular
circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative
medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and
gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred
direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding
electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force
can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall
current. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the
resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional
current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation
characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals
a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link
between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new
possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.

Abstract: Phonon drag may be harnessed for thermoelectric generators and devices. Here,
we demonstrate the geometric control of the phonon-drag contribution to the
thermopower. In nanometer-thin electrically conducting $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
films homoepitaxially-grown on insulating substrates it is enhanced from -0,4
mV/K to up to -3 mV/K at 100 K by choice of the film thickness. Analysis of the
temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients reveal that a crossover from
three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional electron-phonon interaction occurs
for film thicknesses below 75~nm. The ratio of phonon-phonon to electron-phonon
relaxation times in these confined structures is $10$ times larger than that of
bulk. Generally the phonon drag can be tuned depending on the relations between
the phonon-drag interaction length $\lambda_\text{PD}$, the phonon mean free
path $\lambda$ and the film thickness $d$. Phonon drag can be enhanced for
$\lambda_\text{PD}\gg\lambda>d$.

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics defines the ideal quantum thermoelectric, with maximum
possible efficiency at finite power output. However, such an ideal
thermoelectric is challenging to implement experimentally. Instead, here we
consider two types of thermoelectrics regularly implemented in experiments: (i)
finite-height potential barriers or quantum point contacts, and (ii)
double-barrier structures or single-level quantum dots. We model them with
Landauer scattering theory as (i) step transmissions and (ii) Lorentzian
transmissions. We optimize their thermodynamic efficiency for any given power
output, when they are used as thermoelectric heat-engines or refrigerators. The
Lorentzian's efficiency is excellent at vanishing power, but we find that it is
poor at the finite powers of practical interest. In contrast, the step
transmission is remarkably close to ideal efficiency (typically within 15%) at
all power outputs. The step transmission is also close to ideal in the presence
of phonons and other heat-leaks, for which the Lorentzian performs very poorly.
Thus, a simple nanoscale thermoelectric - made with a potential barrier or
quantum point contact - is almost as efficient as an ideal thermoelectric.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of gas sensing in
monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) based field-effect transistors (FET)
using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism and Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
approach. Moving beyond conventional density functional theory analyses, our
framework captures the full device level response by incorporating
field-dependent quantum transport and temperature effects. We model the impact
of NO, H$_2$S, HF and CO$_2$ gases on the band structure and density of states
(DOS), carrier concentration, quantum capacitance and I-V characteristics. The
results indicate that CO$_2$ followed by NO induce strongest perturbations via
mid-gap states and band edge shifts, leading to the appearance of asymmetric
Van-Hove singularities with enhanced carrier modulation and quantum
capacitance. It is observed that HF induce moderate perturbation while H$_2$S
induce weakest response for all temperature and biasing condition. It is found
that an applied vertical electric field narrows the band gap via the Stark
effect, further boosting mobility and tunability. Temperature influences
sensing response by enhancing charge transfer at moderate levels and causing
desorption at higher temperatures. We found that CO$_2$ consistently show the
highest sensitivity and selectivity followed by NO and HF, while H$_2$S display
the weakest response. This study offers a comprehensive framework to engineer
h-BN based FET sensors by harnessing intrinsic band modulation and quantum
capacitance for molecule discrimination and temperature optimization.

Abstract: Trions, charged quasiparticles formed by binding an exciton to an excess
charge carrier, dominate the optical response of doped transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), and the study of the transport properties of trions in
TMDs may have application in developing high-speed excitonic and optoelectronic
devices. However, an important building block for low-dissipation
optoelectronic devices that provides dissipationless transport channels for
trions has remained elusive. Here, we propose the concept of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological trion insulator that features helical dissipationless edge states
for trions. This is realized for intralayer trions, which inherit the
valley-orbit coupling of intralayer excitons in TMDs subject to a moir\'e
periodic potential. We find that under certain circumstances, the moir\'e trion
band becomes topological, characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
number. We further provide two specific material realizations of this
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator: a doped monolayer TMD placed on top of a
twisted hBN substrate, and a generic twisted TMD heterobilayer. We also examine
the effect of charge screening and find that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
trion insulator remains robust. Our work paves the way toward realizing
dissipationless excitonic devices.

Abstract: The commonly believed absence of skyrmion Hall effect for topologically
trivial magnetic skyrmions is reconsidered for bilayer skyrmions in synthetic
antiferromagnets driven by spin-transfer and spin-orbit torques. Using a
general Lagrangian formalism, we show that Bloch-type bilayer skyrmions acquire
a finite Hall angle when driven by spin-orbit torque, while N\'{e}el-type
skyrmions do not, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations. Both types of
skyrmions exhibit current-induced elliptical deformation with minor and major
axes aligned longitudinally and transversely to their velocity, respectively. A
linear relation between velocity and longitudinal radius is derived with a
coefficient proportional to the strength of spin-orbit torque. These effects
are critical for antiferromagnetic skyrmion-based applications such as skyrmion
racetrack memory. The Lagrange equations also reproduce the linear Hall
angle-helicity relation reported by Msiska et al., Phys. Rev. Appl. 17, 064015
(2022). An intuitive explanation of the skyrmion Hall effect for arbitrary
helicity based on the antiferromagnetic exchange torque is also provided.

Abstract: Spin shuttling offers a promising approach for developing scalable
silicon-based quantum processors by addressing the connectivity limitations of

The residual shuttling error is highly sensitive to the ratio between interdot
tunnel coupling and Zeeman splitting, with tuning of these parameters enabling
up to a twenty-fold variation in error rate. An appropriate four-level
Hamiltonian model supports our findings. These results provide valuable
insights for optimizing high-performance spin shuttling systems in future

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices constitute a versatile platform to investigate emergent
phenomena arising from the interplay of strong correlations and topology, while
offering flexible in situ tunability. However, the fabrication of such moir\'e
superlattices is challenging. It is difficult to achieve highly uniform devices
with a precise twist angle because of the unintentional introduction of
heterostrain, twist angle disorder, and angle/lattice relaxation during the
nanofabrication process. This article introduces an optimized,
experience-informed protocol for fabricating high-quality graphene-based
moir\'e superlattice devices, focusing on a modified dry transfer technique.
The transfer process is performed in a highly tunable, custom-built transfer
setup that enables precise position, angle, and temperature control. By
combining rigorous flake selection criteria, pre-cleaned bubble-free bottom
gates, and graphene laser ablation, the moir\'e superlattice is constructed by
deliberately overlaying twisted graphene flakes at a submicron speed at room
temperature. Through precise control of the transfer process, the resulting
graphene moir\'e superlattice devices exhibit high uniformity and desired twist
angles. This optimized protocol addresses existing challenges in the
fabrication of graphene-based moir\'e superlattice devices and paves the way
for further advances in the rapidly evolving field of moir\'e materials.
