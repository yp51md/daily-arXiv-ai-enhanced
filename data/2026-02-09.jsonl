In this work, we reformulate the gravitationally mediated interaction phase in a conformally invariant twistor framework in which no notion of spacetime distance is assumed. We show that the bilocal phase responsible for entanglement generation remains well-defined and non-factorizable even in the absence of spacetime geometry. The familiar Newtonian $1/r$ phase, relevant for QGEM protocols, arises only after the conformal invariance is broken by introducing the infinity twistor, which selects a particular spacetime representation of the underlying bilocal quantum interaction. Our results isolate the genuinely quantum content of QGEM protocols and clarify the contingent role played by spacetime geometry in mediating entanglement."}

Here we realize the Dicke model -- a fundamental description of light-matter interactions -- in a two-dimensional crystal of approximately 100 trapped ions. The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits. In the integrable regime, where the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated, we observe a dynamical phase transition between ferromagnetic to paramagnetic spin phases. In contrast, when the spins and phonons are strongly coupled, we observe clear signatures of non-integrable chaotic dynamics, including erratic phase-space trajectories and the exponential growth of excitations and entanglement quantified by the one-body Rényi entropy. By quenching from an unstable fixed point in the near-integrable regime, quantum noise can generate correlated spin-phonon excitations. Our numerical calculations, in clear agreement with experiment, reveal the generation of two-mode spin-phonon squeezing, 2.6 dB below the standard quantum limit (4.6 dB relative to the initial thermal state), followed by generalized vacuum Rabi collapses and revivals.

A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics."}

Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \\cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $κ(δ)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $δ$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $κ(δ)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $κ(δ)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(π,π)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $ω=0$. The Knight shift, $χ_{sp}(0,0)(δ)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \\approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U < U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $δ_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $δ=δ_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community."}

We establish a feasibility condition for this preservation problem within a broad class of systems exhibiting diminishing returns in error suppression. By defining the preservation stiffness S_kappa, a response function analogous to magnetic susceptibility, we derive an optimality condition linking S_kappa to the resource odds. This identity provides a substrate-agnostic diagnostic: deviations reveal thermodynamic inefficiency or operation outside the smooth reliability regime. For systems in the diminishing-returns regime -- a class we argue is typical of physically realistic error-correction -- the optimal maintenance allocation is bounded above by 50%; for the physically significant subclass exhibiting smooth saturation, it is further constrained to a 30-50% band. We derive this regime from two independent physical principles -- Shannon's channel capacity and Landauer's erasure bound -- whose convergence on the same functional form constitutes our central theoretical contribution. We validate this framework against kinetic proofreading data in E. coli and protocol overhead in TCP/IP networks, and specify conditions under which the prediction is falsifiable."}

In this work, we introduce an iterative strategy for ground-state preparation based on a stepwise (discretized) Hamiltonian deformation. By complementing the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with adiabatic principles, we demonstrate that solving a sequence of intermediate problems facilitates tracking the ground-state manifold toward the target system, even as we scale the system size. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for this approach, proving a lower bound on the loss variance that suggests trainability throughout the deformation, provided the system remains away from gap closings.

Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer)."}

By numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Crank-Nicolson method and split operator method, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the evolution of density distribution in real space and that in momentum space, and the occupation distribution in energy space. It is shown that cold atoms with weak interaction oscillate as a whole body in a finite space when the amplitude of pulse drive is not strong enough. During the evolution atoms occupy the bound states with larger probability. Increasing the driving strength or atomic interactions promotes the excitation of atoms into continuum states and their diffusion out of the potential well, leading to complex structures or even interference-like patterns in the momentum distribution. The number of cycles in the pulse envelope plays a crucial role in the dynamical behavior: High-frequency driving can suppress diffusion and maintain localization.

Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9968], in this work we propose a practical framework for determining the ensemble N-representability of a p-body matrix. This is accomplished using a purification strategy consisting of embedding an ensemble state into a pure state defined on an extended Hilbert space, such that the reduced density matrices of the purified state reproduce those of the original ensemble. By iteratively applying variational unitaries to an initial purified state, the proposed algorithm minimizes the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between its p-body reduced density matrix and a specified target p-body matrix, which serves as a measure of the N-representability of the target. This methodology facilitates both error correction of defective ensemble reduced density matrices, and quantum-state reconstruction on a quantum computer, offering a route for density-matrix refinement.

A major challenge is the identification of such correlated systems with dominantly 1D physics. In this work, inelastic neutron scattering measurements on NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As single crystal directly reveal quasi-1D spin excitations, resulting from atomic order that lead to magnetic Fe and nonmagnetic Cu chains. The dominant exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic along the chain ($SJ_{\\rm \\parallel}\\approx90.1(3)$~meV), whereas the inter-chain couplings are much weaker ($SJ_{\\rm \\perp}\\approx-2.4(1)$~meV and $SJ_{\\rm c}\\approx0.15(5)$~meV). The quasi-1D spin excitations in NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As stem from both the Néel and stripe vectors, with Néel excitations sensitive to Fe impurities on the Cu site. The spin excitations in quasi-1D NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As and quasi-2D FeSe exhibit a striking resemblance, suggesting a common origin for their coexistent stripe and Néel excitations.

We show that among all microscopic structures compatible with a given macroscopic constraint, those rendering the observation statistically most typical are selected. As an explicit illustration, we demonstrate how ordered microscopic structures can emerge purely from inference under constraint, even when the reference measure is fully permutation symmetric. Order is thus not assumed but inferred, serving here only as an illustrative example of a broader class of relational explanatory hypotheses constrained by observation."}

Motivated by the promising results observed in using quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) for approximating complicated probability distributions, we combine ideas of sampling from the device with QeMCMC together with warm-starting and parallel tempering, in the context of combinatorial optimization.

A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal Lüscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics."}

Here, we resolve this trade-off by introducing Tensor Network Dynamical Message Passing (TNDMP), a framework grounded in a rigorous property we term \\textit{Susceptible-Induced Factorization}. This theoretical insight reveals that a susceptible node acts as a dynamical decoupler, factorizing the global evolution operator into localized components. Leveraging this, TNDMP provides a dual-mode algorithmic suite: an exact algorithm that computes local observables with minimal redundancy on tractable topologies and a scalable and tunable approximation for complex real-world networks. We demonstrate that widely adopted heuristics, such as Dynamical Message Passing (DMP) and Pair Approximation (PA), are mathematically recoverable as low-order limits of our framework. Numerical validation in synthetic and real-world networks confirms that TNDMP significantly outperforms existing methods to predict epidemic thresholds and steady states, offering a rigorous bridge between the efficiency of message passing and the accuracy of tensor network formalisms."}

In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3."}

In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology.

By tuning the hysteresis, we engineer a non-equilibrium steady state with an adjustable effective temperature, enabling erasure processes that consume over 20 percents below the Landauer bound.

In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality.

We first introduce infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE); a quantum state, including pure states, is in iMATE if the expectation values of all additive observables agree with their equilibrium values. We also introduce a macroscopic operation as unitary evolution generated by a time-dependent additive Hamiltonian, which is regarded as corresponding to adiabatic operations. Employing these concepts, we show that no extensive work can be extracted from any quantum state in iMATE through any macroscopic operations. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum-mechanical form of entropy density such that it agrees with thermodynamic entropy density for any quantum state in iMATE. We then prove that for any initial state in iMATE, this entropy density cannot be decreased by any macroscopic operations, followed by a time-independent relaxation process. Our theory thus proves two different forms of the second law, by adopting macroscopically reasonable classes of observables, equilibrium states, and operations. We also discuss the time scales of macroscopic operations in these results."}

We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive.

Distinguished from trusted-device QRNGs whose security depends on characterized devices, semi-device-independent (semi-DI) QRNGs permit partial devices to be defective or even maliciously manipulated, which achieves a good trade-off between generation rate and security. In this paper, we propose a semi-DI QRNG that resists general attacks while accounting for finite-size effects. The protocol requires no rigorous characterization of the source and measurement devices other than limiting the energy of the emitted states, significantly reducing the demands on practical QRNG systems. Leveraging the tight Kato inequality for correlated variables, we show that our protocol generates more randomness than it consumes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scheme on a continuous-variable system with ternary inputs of states. Heterodyne detection is employed to enable phase compensation through data postprocessing, alleviating the stringent requirement on system stability. The system operates at 100 MHz, achieving a net random number generation rate of 1.165 Mbps at 5.3x10^9 rounds.

Quantum technologies offer a fundamentally new means of shaping economic behavior by introducing non-classical correlations between decision-makers. Here we demonstrate a prototype quantum stock market in which entanglement between traders' valuations mitigates the runaway devaluation characteristic of speculative busts. Using reinforcement-learning agents trading a single commodity, we show that replacing classical valuations with quantum-correlated qubit-encoded valuations stabilizes prices and increases the AI traders' net worth relative to a classical market, where instead agents rapidly converge to liquidation strategies that collapse the asset value. To explain this behavior, we formulate and analyze a quantized version of the $p$-guessing game, a canonical model of speculative dynamics. Quantum entanglement and phase coherence reshape the strategic landscape, eliminating the pathological pure-strategy Nash equilibrium that drives market collapse in the classical game, while mixed-strategy equilibria remain non-degenerate and avoid bust-type outcomes. These results identify quantum correlations as a novel, endogenous mechanism for market stabilization and, more broadly, demonstrate the utility of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for uncovering optimal strategies in complex decision-making frameworks with quantum degrees of freedom."}

Treating the ACE2--Spike interface as an open quantum system embedded in a biological environment, we simulate how vibrational interactions and environmental memory reshape the coupled receptor--ligand dynamics and modulate vibrationally assisted electron transfer (VA-ET). Using a Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation (NMSSE) approach, we simulate electron transfer between donor and acceptor states in ACE2 modulated by a specific vibrational mode of the Spike protein. The influence of environmental memory (non-Markovian dynamics) and non-Condon effects (vibrational modulation of electronic coupling) are analyzed in detail. In the Markovian limit with an Ohmic bath, population dynamics reduce to exponential kinetics, and extracted transfer rates agree with semiclassical Marcus--Jortner predictions in the appropriate regime. Beyond the Markovian, high-temperature limit, we observe clear deviations: non-exponential decay, coherent oscillatory features, and enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational frequency. Incorporating off-diagonal system--bath coupling alongside diagonal coupling shows that nuclear motion can dynamically gate electron tunneling, sharpening the frequency selectivity of the VA-ET mechanism. Finally, a structured (sub-Ohmic) environmental spectral density with long-lived correlations (``memory'') preserves electronic--vibrational coherence over longer times, amplifying vibrational selectivity under non-Condon coupling. Our results support the proposition that ACE2--Spike binding may exploit vibrational assistance and quantum coherence as a molecular recognition mechanism."}

In this work, a simpler algebraic decomposition is proposed to separate the preparation of the real part of the desired state from the complex one, resulting in a reduction in terms of circuit depth, total gates, and CNOT count when $m$ ancillary qubits are available. The reduction in complexity is due to the use of a single operator $Λ$ for each uniformly controlled gate, instead of the three in the original decomposition.

This paper introduces the Quantum Sieve Tracer, a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to characterize factual recall circuits. We implement a modular pipeline that first localizes critical layers using classical causal tracing, then maps specific attention head activations into an exponentially large quantum Hilbert space. Using open-weight models (Meta Llama-3.2-1B and Alibaba Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct), we perform a two-stage analysis that reveals a fundamental architectural divergence. While Qwen's layer 7 circuit functions as a classic Recall Hub, we discover that Llama's layer 9 acts as an Interference Suppression circuit, where ablating the identified heads paradoxically improves factual recall. Our results demonstrate that quantum kernels can distinguish between these constructive (recall) and reductive (suppression) mechanisms, offering a high-resolution tool for analyzing the fine-grained topology of attention."}

We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to the splitting of operator space into commuting sub-algebras. The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos. We prove an entanglement area-law due to local constraints and we study its stability against projective measurements. In a random ensemble exhibiting causal independence, we compare spectral correlations with the universal (chaotic) ensemble using the spectral form factor. Our results offer a rigorous understanding of locally constrained quantum dynamics from a quantum information perspective."}

Our equation of state links the cascade amplitude with the underlying scale-invariant energy flux, and can, for different drive strengths, gas densities, and interaction strengths, be recast into a universal power-law form using scalings consistent with the Gross-Pitaevskii model."}

Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $π$-pulse excitation of $V_{\\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\\sim60\\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects.

We focus on two exemplary dimer models that preserve parity-time symmetry via spatial gain-loss balance and exhibit non-reciprocity due to directional hopping. The scattering matrix is constructed using the biorthogonality of the left and right scattering states of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities. Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. Our results clarify how biorthogonality restores generalized unitarity and identify distinct physical origins of enhanced transport in PT-symmetric and non-reciprocal dimers, providing new insights into quantum transport in non-Hermitian systems."}

On the other hand, it is recently established that even pure quantum states can represent thermal equilibrium. However, pure quantum states do not satisfy the second law in that they are not passive, i.e., work can be extracted from them if arbitrary unitary operations are allowed. It therefore remains unresolved how quantum mechanics can be reconciled with thermodynamics. Here, based on our key quantum-mechanical notions of thermal equilibrium and adiabatic operations, we address the emergence of the second law for adiabatic operations in the thermodynamics limit. We first introduce infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE); a quantum state, including pure states, is in iMATE if the expectation values of all additive observables agree with their equilibrium values. We also introduce a macroscopic operation as unitary evolution generated by a time-dependent additive Hamiltonian, which is regarded as corresponding to adiabatic operations. Employing these concepts, we show that no extensive work can be extracted from any quantum state in iMATE through any macroscopic operations. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum-mechanical form of entropy density such that it agrees with thermodynamic entropy density for any quantum state in iMATE. We then prove that for any initial state in iMATE, this entropy density cannot be decreased by any macroscopic operations, followed by a time-independent relaxation process. Our theory thus proves two different forms of the second law, by adopting macroscopically reasonable classes of observables, equilibrium states, and operations. We also discuss the time scales of macroscopic operations in these results."}

However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power."}
