While\ntraditional quantum error correction codes require substantial qubit overhead\nand complex syndrome decoding, we propose a machine learning approach that\ndirectly reconstructs clean quantum states from noisy density matrices without\nadditional qubits. We formulate quantum noise reduction as a supervised\nlearning problem using a convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder\narchitecture with a novel fidelity-aware composite loss function. Our method is\ntrained and evaluated on a comprehensive synthetic dataset of 10,000 density\nmatrices derived from random 5-qubit quantum circuits, encompassing five noise\ntypes (depolarizing, amplitude damping, phase damping, bit-flip, and mixed\nnoise) across four intensity levels (0.05-0.20). The CNN successfully\nreconstructs quantum states across all noise conditions, achieving an average\nfidelity improvement from 0.298 to 0.774 ({\\Delta} = 0.476). Notably, the model\ndemonstrates superior performance on complex mixed noise scenarios and higher\nnoise intensities, with mixed noise showing the highest corrected fidelity\n(0.807) and improvement (0.567). The approach effectively preserves both\ndiagonal elements (populations) and off-diagonal elements (quantum coherences),\nmaking it suitable for entanglement-dependent quantum algorithms. While phase\ndamping presents fundamental information-theoretic limitations, our results\nsuggest that CNN-based density matrix reconstruction offers a promising,\nresource-efficient alternative to traditional quantum error correction for\nNISQ-era devices. This data-driven approach could enable practical quantum\nadvantage with fewer physical qubits than conventional error correction schemes\nrequire."}

Recently, a moir\\'e superstructure formed by two coexisting charge\ndensity wave (CDW) orders with slightly mismatched wavevectors has been\nrealized. These incommensurate CDWs can collectively exhibit commensurability,\nresulting in the jointly commensurate CDW (JC-CDW). This JC-CDW hosts phenomena\nincluding electronic anisotropy and phase-modulated hysteresis, and holds\npromise for non-volatile optoelectronic memory devices. Realizing such\nfunctionality requires understanding how the spatial periodicity, coherence,\nand amplitude of this order evolve under perturbations. Here, we address these\nquestions using time- and momentum-resolved techniques to probe light-induced\ndynamics in EuTe$_4$. Our time-resolved diffraction results show that under\nintense photoexcitation, the JC-CDW wavevector and coherence length remain\nlocked along the CDW direction, indicating preserved moir\\'e periodicity while\nthe moir\\'e potential depth is suppressed. This robustness governs the\nconfiguration of the photoexcited JC-CDW and leads to the formation of\npreviously underexplored shear-type topological defects. Furthermore, we\ndeveloped an approach to simultaneously track the temporal evolution of the\namplitude and phase of a CDW by following two diffraction peaks corresponding\nto one order, with findings verified by time-resolved photoemission and\nelectron diffraction. This methodology enables reconstruction of the momentum-\nand time-resolved evolution of the JC-CDW and direct visualization of\nshear-type topological defect formation. These findings not only highlight the\nunique robustness of JC-CDWs out of equilibrium, but also establish a platform\nfor optical moir\\'e engineering and manipulation of quantum materials through\ntopological defect control."}

Determining what parameters and geometry to use\nfor the auxiliary modes, however, is non-trivial and involves many subtleties.\nIn this paper we revisit this problem of pseudomode design and investigate some\nof these subtleties. In particular, we examine the scenario in which\npseudomodes couple to each other, resulting in an effective spectral density\nthat is no longer a sum of Lorentzians. We show that non-diagonalizability of\nthe pseudomodes' effective single-particle non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can lead\nto terms in the effective spectral density which cannot be obtained by\ndiagonalizable non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We also present a method for\nconstructing the pseudomode parameters to exactly match a fit to a spectral\ndensity, and in doing so illuminate the enormous freedom in this process. The\ncase of many uncoupled pseudomodes is explored, and we show how, contrary to\nconventional assumption, the effective spectral density does not necessarily\nconverge in the limit of an infinite number of pseudomodes; we attribute this\nto the non-completeness of Lorentzians as basis functions.

Model-free measurement error mitigation (MF-MEM) is an\nimportant class of MEM methods that employs Pauli twirling-typically with a\nrandom twirling set-to convert measurement noise into a state-independent\nscaling factor, thereby enabling error mitigation through simple calibration.\nHowever, such methods face prohibitive sampling overhead, limiting their\nscalability. To address this, we introduce subsystem-balanced Pauli twirling\n(SB-PT), a twirling method designed for MF-MEM that enforces Pauli operator\nbalance on measuring subsystems to selectively suppress dominant measurement\nnoise. Theoretically, for a weight-r Pauli observable, SB-PT removes all\nindependent error components using only O[4^r] random circuits, substantially\nreducing the sampling overhead over conventional Pauli twirling. This\nefficiency gain is most significant for sparse observables. To extend such\nresource-efficient mitigation to arbitrary observables, we develop a\nhardware-efficient measurement transformation framework that converts\nhigh-weight Pauli operators into low-weight effective ones via linear-depth\ncircuits. The circuit noise introduced during this transformation is jointly\nmitigated with native measurement noise using a unified twirling protocol,\nensuring robust performance.

Certifying key properties -- such as entanglement, circuit\ncomplexity, and quantum magic -- using simple local measurements is highly\ndesirable but challenging. In this work, we introduce a highly general\ncertification framework based on a physical phenomenon that we call localizable\nquantumness: for generic many-body states, essential quantum properties are\nrobustly preserved within the projected ensembles on small subsystems after\nperforming local projective measurements on the rest of the system. Leveraging\nthis insight, we develop certification protocols that certify global properties\nby witnessing them on a small, accessible subsystem.

Our study\nfocuses on distributing end-to-end entanglement in a homogeneous,\nrepeater-based linear quantum network operating under a non-Pauli noise,\nspecifically, amplitude damping noise, which we refer to as amplitude\ndamping-affected quantum network (AQN). Unlike its twirled counterpart (TAQN),\nwhere the resulting state is fully Bell-diagonal with a single parameter, we\nprove that the AQN produces a block-diagonal state in the Bell basis with four\nparameters.
