### [1] [PennyCoder: Efficient Domain-Specific LLMs for PennyLane-Based Quantum Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19562)
*Abdul Basit,Minghao Shao,Muhammad Haider Asif,Nouhaila Innan,Muhammad Kashif,Alberto Marchisio,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: PennyCoder是一个轻量级框架，用于本地量子代码生成，解决了现有LLM依赖远程API的隐私、延迟和成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的量子代码助手依赖远程API，带来隐私、延迟和高成本问题，需要本地化解决方案。

Method: PennyCoder采用参数高效的LoRA技术微调LLaMA 3.1-8B模型，并结合领域特定指令调优，适用于PennyLane的量子编程。

Result: 在量子编程数据集上，PennyCoder的微调模型达到44.3%准确率，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: PennyCoder实现了本地高效量子代码生成，为量子编程提供了隐私安全且低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for robust quantum programming frameworks has unveiled a
critical limitation: current large language model (LLM) based quantum code
assistants heavily rely on remote APIs, introducing challenges related to
privacy, latency, and excessive usage costs. Addressing this gap, we propose
PennyCoder, a novel lightweight framework for quantum code generation,
explicitly designed for local and embedded deployment to enable on-device
quantum programming assistance without external API dependence. PennyCoder
leverages a fine-tuned version of the LLaMA 3.1-8B model, adapted through
parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques combined with
domain-specific instruction tuning optimized for the specialized syntax and
computational logic of quantum programming in PennyLane, including tasks in
quantum machine learning and quantum reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work
focused on cloud-based quantum code generation, our approach emphasizes
device-native operability while maintaining high model efficacy. We rigorously
evaluated PennyCoder over a comprehensive quantum programming dataset,
achieving 44.3% accuracy with our fine-tuned model (compared to 33.7% for the
base LLaMA 3.1-8B and 40.1% for the RAG-augmented baseline), demonstrating a
significant improvement in functional correctness.

Result: 该方法在空间搜索算法中实现了二次加速。

Conclusion: 里德堡原子的交错量子行走为复杂网络问题提供了高效的量子解决方案。

Abstract: Rydberg atoms provide a highly promising platform for quantum computation,
leveraging their strong tunable interactions to encode and manipulate
information in the electronic states of individual atoms. Key advantages of
Rydberg atoms include scalability, reconfigurable connectivity, and native
multi-qubit gates, making them particularly well-suited for addressing complex
network problems. These problems can often be framed as graph-based tasks,
which can be efficiently addressed using quantum walks. In this work, we
propose a general implementation of staggered quantum walks with Rydberg atoms,
with a particular focus on spatial networks. We also present an efficient
algorithm for constructing the tessellations required for the staggered quantum
walk. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposal achieves quadratic speedup in
spatial search algorithms.

*Hatim Salih,Jonte R. Hance,Will McCutcheon,John Rarity*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 作者反驳了Popescu对其论文的批评，强调其关于反事实通信的研究在特定条件下是有效的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回应Popescu的批评，澄清其研究的有效性和具体条件。

Method: 通过理论和实验证明，在特定条件下（后选择粒子）反事实通信是可能的。

Result: 证明了反事实通信在特定条件下可以实现，且不违反弱迹或一致历史路径标准。

Conclusion: 作者坚持其研究的正确性，并指出批评者的简化误解了其协议的具体细节。

Abstract: In his Comment on our recent paper ``The laws of physics do not prohibit
counterfactual communication'', \textit{npj Quantum Information} (2022) 8:60,
Popescu argues that the claims of the paper are invalid. Here, we refute his
argument, showing that it is based on ignoring the specifics of what we set out
to prove (that counterfactual communication is possible \emph{for post-selected
particles}, and more specifically in these cases is not prohibited by the weak
trace or consistent histories criteria for particle path), followed by an
unwarranted simplification of the protocol. Moreover, the Comment's excursion
into interpretation is misplaced. Our communication protocol is a precisely
defined one that allows two remote parties, albeit rarely, to communicate an
arbitrarily long binary message, with arbitrarily high accuracy. This is not a
matter of interpretation -- as the concrete example given in our paper in
question illustrates. As for our overarching claim that no particles are
exchanged in the course of this communication, we have already demonstrated
this both theoretically and experimentally, in the postselected case we
consider, as per the weak trace and consistent histories criteria for path of a
quantum particle.

### [4] [Light and divergences: History and outlook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19569)
*Gerd Leuchs,Luis L. Sanchez-Soto*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了真空并非空无一物，而是充满量子特性，并回顾了量子电动力学（QED）在计算精细结构常数α时的局限性及其随能量变化的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真空的量子性质及其在QED中的表现，尤其是精细结构常数α的计算问题。

Method: 回顾历史发展，提出一个简单模型描述低能区真空极化，将麦克斯韦位移与真空量子特性联系起来。

Result: QED虽成功但存在奇点和发散问题，无法精确计算α，但能描述其随能量变化的特性。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以解决QED的局限性，推动对真空量子性质的深入理解。

Abstract: All experimental evidence {indicates} that the vacuum is not void, but filled
with something truly quantum. This is reflected by terms such as {zero-point}
fluctuations, and Dirac's sea of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs, and last
but not least the vacuum is the medium responsible for Maxwell's displacement
current. While quantum electrodynamics (QED) is an exceptionally successful
theory, it remains a perturbative framework rather than a fully self-contained
one. Inherently, it includes singularities and divergences, which prevent the
precise calculation of fundamental quantities such as the fine-structure
constant $\alpha$. Any direct attempt to compute $\alpha$ results in divergent
values. However, and most remarkable, what can be determined is how $\alpha$
``runs", meaning how it varies with energy or exchanged momentum. In this
article, we review the historical development of these ideas, the current state
of knowledge, and ongoing efforts to find ways to move further. This includes a
simple model to describe vacuum polarization in the low-energy regime, when
considering only small (linear) deviations from the equilibrium {state},
relating {Maxwell's displacement} in the vacuum, to the quantum properties of
the vacuum.

### [5] [Neural Importance Resampling: A Practical Sampling Strategy for Neural Quantum States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20510)
*Eimantas Ledinauskas,Egidijus Anisimovas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的采样算法NIR，结合重要性重采样和自回归网络，解决了NQS中采样效率低和架构限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NQS的采样技术（如MCMC和自回归方法）存在效率低、架构限制等问题，影响了其实际应用。

Method: 引入Neural Importance Resampling (NIR)，结合重要性重采样和自回归网络，实现高效且无偏的采样。

Result: NIR在2D横向场Ising模型中表现优于MCMC，与DMRG方法竞争，支持多态NQS的稳定训练。

Conclusion: NIR是一种稳健的采样替代方案，适用于变分NQS算法。

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
many-body quantum systems, but their practical use is often hindered by
limitations of current sampling techniques. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods suffer from slow mixing and require manual tuning, while autoregressive
NQS impose restrictive architectural constraints that complicate the
enforcement of symmetries and the construction of determinant-based multi-state
wave functions. In this work, we introduce Neural Importance Resampling (NIR),
a new sampling algorithm that combines importance resampling with a separately
trained autoregressive proposal network. This approach enables efficient and
unbiased sampling without constraining the NQS architecture. We demonstrate
that NIR supports stable and scalable training, including for multi-state NQS,
and mitigates issues faced by MCMC and autoregressive approaches. Numerical
experiments on the 2D transverse-field Ising model show that NIR outperforms
MCMC in challenging regimes and yields results competitive with density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Our results establish NIR as a robust
alternative for sampling in variational NQS algorithms.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) with both dynamical
matter and gauge fields provide a promising approach to studying strongly
coupled problems beyond classical computational reach. Yet, implementing
gauge-invariant encodings and real-time evolution remains experimentally
challenging. Here, we demonstrate a resource-efficient encoding of a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT using a hybrid qubit-oscillator trapped-ion quantum device,
where qubits represent gauge fields and vibrational modes naturally encode
bosonic matter fields. This architecture utilises synthetic dimensions to
construct higher-dimensional lattice geometries and combines digital and
analogue techniques to prepare initial states, realise gauge-invariant
real-time evolution, and measure the relevant observables. We experimentally
probe dynamics obeying Gauss's law in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ link and extend this to
a loop geometry, marking the first steps towards higher-dimensional LGTs. In
this quasi-2D setup, we observe Aharonov-Bohm interference for the first time
with dynamical gauge fields encoding magnetic flux, demonstrating the interplay
between charge and flux. Our results chart a promising path for scalable
quantum simulations of bosonic gauge theories and outline a roadmap for
realising exotic LGTs in higher dimensions.

Motivation: 传统变分量子电路（VQC）因局域测量限制性能，需改进以提升量子机器学习的实用性。

Method: 提出自适应非局域观测（ANO）范式，联合优化电路参数和多量子比特测量，应用于DQN和A3C算法。

Result: ANO-VQC在多个基准任务中优于基线VQC，自适应测量扩展功能空间而不增加电路深度。

Conclusion: 自适应多量子比特观测可实现强化学习中的实际量子优势。

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical frameworks leverage quantum computing for machine
learning; however, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are limited by the need
for local measurements. We introduce an adaptive non-local observable (ANO)
paradigm within VQCs for quantum reinforcement learning (QRL), jointly
optimizing circuit parameters and multi-qubit measurements. The ANO-VQC
architecture serves as the function approximator in Deep Q-Network (DQN) and
Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms. On multiple benchmark
tasks, ANO-VQC agents outperform baseline VQCs. Ablation studies reveal that
adaptive measurements enhance the function space without increasing circuit
depth. Our results demonstrate that adaptive multi-qubit observables can enable
practical quantum advantages in reinforcement learning.

### [8] [Quantum Internet Architecture: unlocking Quantum-Native Routing via Quantum Addressing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19655)
*Marcello Caleffi,Angela Sara Cacciapuoti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分层量子互联网架构，围绕纠缠定义的控制器设计，解决了量子互联网的可扩展性和高效管理问题，并引入了量子原生控制平面、量子寻址方案和路由协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子互联网的核心目标是分配和操作量子纠缠，而非传输经典信息，这打破了经典互联网的设计原则（如端到端原则），需要重新设计网络架构和控制平面。

Method: 提出分层量子互联网架构，引入纠缠定义的控制器；设计量子寻址方案和路由协议，利用量子现象优化节点标识和路由表；基于薛定谔预言机实现量子地址分割功能。

Result: 展示了量子原生网络功能的优势，实现了可扩展和高效的量子互联网管理。

Conclusion: 论文首次证明了量子原生设计的网络功能在量子互联网中的关键优势，为未来量子网络的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The Quantum Internet introduces a fundamental shift in the network design,
since its key objective is the distribution and manipulation of quantum
entanglement, rather than the transmission of classical information. This shift
breaks key classical Internet design principles, such as the end-to-end
argument, due to the inherently stateful and non-local nature of entangled
states that require coordinated in-network operations. Consequently, in this
paper we propose a novel hierarchical Quantum Internet architecture centered
around the concept of entanglement-defined controller, enabling scalable and
efficient management of the aforementioned in-network operations. However,
architecture alone is insufficient for network scalability, which requires a
quantum-native control plane that fundamentally rethinks addressing and
routing. Consequently, we propose a quantum addressing scheme that embraces the
principles and quantum phenomena within the node identifiers. Built upon this
addressing scheme, we also design a quantum-native routing protocol that
exhibits scalable and compact routing tables, by efficiently operating over
entanglement-aware topologies. Finally, we design a quantum address splitting
functionality based on Schr\"odinger's oracles that generalizes classical
match-and-forward logic to the quantum domain. Together, these contributions
demonstrate, for the first time, the key advantages of quantum-by-design
network functioning.

Abstract: Convolution operations are foundational to classical image processing and
modern deep learning architectures, yet their extension into the quantum domain
has remained algorithmically and physically costly due to inefficient data
encoding and prohibitive circuit complexity. In this work, we present a
resource-efficient quantum algorithm that reformulates the convolution product
as a structured matrix multiplication via a novel sparse reshaping formalism.
Leveraging the observation that localized convolutions can be encoded as doubly
block-Toeplitz matrix multiplications, we construct a quantum framework wherein
sparse input patches are prepared using optimized key-value QRAM state
encoding, while convolutional filters are represented as quantum states in
superposition. The convolution outputs are computed through inner product
estimation using a low-depth SWAP test circuit, which yields probabilistic
amplitude information with reduced sampling overhead. Our architecture supports
batched convolution across multiple filters using a generalized SWAP circuit.
Compared to prior quantum convolutional approaches, our method eliminates
redundant preparation costs, scales logarithmically with input size under
sparsity, and enables direct integration into hybrid quantum-classical machine
learning pipelines. This work provides a scalable and physically realizable
pathway toward quantum-enhanced feature extraction, opening up new
possibilities for quantum convolutional neural networks and data-driven quantum
inference.

Conclusion: 光子衰减率是控制极化子传输的有效参数，为研究其他耗散机制提供了基础。

Abstract: Motivated by the recent advances in optical imaging and tracking of
wave-packet propagation in optical cavities, we systematically explore the
non-Hermitian polariton dynamics within a decay-tunable multimode cavity model.
The complex eigen-spectrum of the model Hamiltonian allows us to predict the
incoherent-coherent transition induced by photon losses, which defines an
exceptional point at resonance and evolves analytically as the wavevector
shifts off-resonantly. The resulting dispersion relation, group velocity, and
relaxation rate exhibit striking signatures, such as curve crossing, level
repulsion, turnover, bifurcation, and coalescence, as the decay rate crosses
the critical transition or the wavevector crosses the resonance. The spectral
characterization leads to surprising features in the non-Hermitian wave packet
dynamics: (i) maximal population relaxation rate at the critical transition;
(ii) reversed propagation in the center-of-mass motion; (iii)
ballistic-to-diffusion transition; (iv) contraction in the displacement and
width of the polariton wave-packet. These dynamical features have complementary
symmetry between the upper-polariton (UP) branch and lower-polariton (LP)
branch in the two-dimensional phase diagram spanned by the photon decay rate
and wavevector. Thus, the combination of complex spectral characterization and
non-Hermitian wave packet propagation establishes the photon decay rate as a
powerful control parameter for polariton transport, reveals the underlying
symmetry in lossy cavities, and presents a starting point to incorporate other
dissipative mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent work (Nathan et al, arXiv:2405.05671) proposed an architecture for a
dissipatively stabilized GKP qubit, and protocols for protected Clifford gates.
Here we propose a protocol for a protected non-Clifford $\sqrt{T}$ gate at the
physical qubit level, based on the inclusion of a quartic flux potential
generated by ancillary Josephson junctions. We show that such a gate is
topologically robust with exponentially suppressed infidelity from control or
device imperfections, and operates on microsecond timescales for GHz
resonators. We analyze the resilience of the protocol to noise, imperfect
control, and imperfect targeting of circuit parameters.

Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum correlations and a
key resource underpinning advances in quantum information and many-body
physics. We uncover a universal relationship between bipartite entanglement
entropy and particle number after the barrier in a one-dimensional
Fermi-Hubbard system with an external asymmetric potential. Using
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks - a novel machine learning architecture - we learn
this relationship across a broad range of interaction strengths with
near-perfect predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a simple analytical
binary-entropy-like expression that quantitatively captures the observed
correlation for fixed parameters. Our findings open new avenues for
characterizing quantum correlations in transport phenomena and provide a
powerful framework for predicting entanglement evolution in quantum systems.

Conclusion: 半经典方法有效解决了经典谱的发散问题，并揭示了能量谱与时间/相位的线性关系。

Abstract: In this work, we study the electromagnetic energy and energy rate spectra
produced by a point particle in the presence of plane wave fields. Our approach
is based on a semiclassical formulation, in which the current distribution that
generates electromagnetic radiation is treated classically while the radiation
field is quantum. Unlike the classical energy spectrum--which exhibits
divergences linked to the duration of interaction between the particle and the
external field--the semiclassical spectrum is finite because radiation is
produced during the quantum transition from an initial state without photons to
the final state with photons at time $t$. In our formulation, we find that the
maximum energy spectrum emitted by the particle is linearly proportional to
time or phase, depending on the external field. This allowed us not only to
extract the maximum energy rate spectra emitted by the particle but also to
correlate them with energy rates derived in the framework of Classical
Electrodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics.

Abstract: We study the ultimate precision limits of a spin chain, strongly coupled to a
heat bath, for measuring a general parameter and report the results for
specific cases of magnetometry and thermometry. Employing a full polaron
transform, we derive the effective Hamiltonian and obtain analytical
expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of equilibrium states in
both weak coupling (WC) and strong coupling (SC) regimes for a general
parameter, explicitly accounting for finite-size (FS) effects. Furthermore, we
utilize Hill's nanothermodynamics to calculate an effective QFI expression at
SC. Our results reveal a potential advantage of SC for thermometry at low
temperatures and demonstrate enhanced magnetometric precision through control
of the anisotropy parameter. Crucially, we show that neglecting FS effects
leads to considerable errors in ultimate precision bounds for equilibrium
thermometry. This work also highlights the inadequacy of phenomenological
approaches in describing the metrological capability and thermodynamic behavior
of systems at SC. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of bath on system's
phase transition at SC.

Conclusion: 不同路径信息记录方法对干涉实验的结果有显著影响，验证了量子互补性原理。

Abstract: Young's double slit experiment has often been used to illustrate the concept
of complementarity in quantum mechanics. If information can in principle be
obtained about the path of the photon, then the visibility of the interference
fringes is reduced or even destroyed. This Gedanken experiment discussed by
Bohr and Einstein can be realized when the slit is replaced by individual atoms
sensitive to the transferred recoil momentum of a photon which "passes through
the slit". Early pioneering experiments were done with trapped ions and atom
pairs created via photo-dissociation. Recently, it became possible to perform
interference experiments with single neutral atoms cooled to the absolute
ground state of a harmonic oscillator potential. The slits are now single atoms
representing a two-level system, and the excitation in the harmonic oscillator
potential is the which-way marker. In this note, we analyze and generalize two
recent experiments performed with single atoms and emphasize the different ways
they record which-way information.

Abstract: Learning the behaviour of chaotic systems remains challenging due to
instability in long-term predictions and difficulties in accurately capturing
invariant statistical properties. While quantum machine learning offers a
promising route to efficiently capture physical properties from
high-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware
noise and limited scalability. We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning
framework for learning partial differential equations, with an application
focus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn
the invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial
memory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a
compact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data
storage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw
simulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then
incorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such
as gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical
fidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent
channel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves superior
performance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum priors. This

Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising metaheuristic for solving constrained
combinatorial optimization problems. However, parameter tuning difficulties and
hardware noise often prevent optimal solutions from being properly encoded as
the ground states of the problem Hamiltonian. This study investigates
mid-anneal measurement as a mitigation approach for such situations, analyzing
its effectiveness and underlying physical mechanisms. We introduce a
quantitative metric to evaluate the effectiveness of mid-anneal measurement and
apply it to the graph bipartitioning problem and the quadratic knapsack
problem. Our findings reveal that mid-anneal measurement is most effective when
the energy difference between desired solutions and ground states is small,
with effectiveness strongly governed by the energy structure. Furthermore, the
effectiveness increases as the Hamming distance between the ground and excited
states gets small, highlighting the role of state similarity. Analysis of
fully-connected Ising models demonstrates that the effectiveness of mid-anneal
measurement persists with increasing system size, indicating its scalability
and practical applicability to large-scale quantum annealing.

Conclusion: 未来可通过结合两种通道提高精度。

Abstract: A diagrammatic multi-reference generalization of many-body perturbation
theory was recently introduced [J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2025, 16, 3047]. This
framework allows us to extend single-reference (SR) Green's function methods
defined at the diagrammatic level naturally into multi-reference case, as
previously exemplified by the formulation of multi-reference direct random
phase approximation (MR-dRPA) and the multi-reference second-order screened
exchange approximation (MR-SOSEX). In this work, we further elaborate this
framework and use it to develop MR generalizations of two other RPA variants,
namely, particle-hole (ph) RPA with exchange (MR-RPAx) and particle-particle
RPA (MR-ppRPA). We define these two MR generalizations by infinite order
resummations of the generalized `ring' and `ladder' diagrams with
antisymmetrized interaction vertices, respectively, which incorporate the
contributions from the active-space connected two-body Green's functions. As
for MR-dRPA, we derive unified sets of equations that hold at both SR and MR
levels for RPAx and ppRPA, respectively. We perform numerical studies of
prototypical systems using the three MR-RPA methods and carry out a
perturbative analysis to gain a deeper understanding of their behaviors. We
find that error cancellation between the second and third orders is a key
factor for both SR-RPA and MR-RPA. In addition, we observe that MR-phRPA
(MR-dRPA and MR-RPAx) and MR-ppRPA tend to overestimate and underestimate
correlation energies, respectively, suggesting that a better accuracy can be
achieved by further combining these two channels in the future.

Conclusion: 通过对称群作用和参数空间离散化，成功构建了高阶Berry曲率的拓扑不变量，揭示了相变点的缺陷特性及其与对称性结构的关联。

Abstract: We analyze topological phase transitions and higher Berry curvature in
one-dimensional quantum spin systems, using a framework that explicitly
incorporates the symmetry group action on the parameter space. Based on a
$G$-compatible discretization of the parameter space, we incorporate both group
cochains and parameter-space differentials, enabling the systematic
construction of equivariant topological invariants. We derive a fixed-point
formula for the higher Berry invariant in the case where the symmetry action
has isolated fixed points. This reveals that the phase transition point between
Haldane and trivial phases acts as a monopole-like defect where higher Berry
curvature emanates. We further discuss hierarchical structures of topological
defects in the parameter space, governed by symmetry reductions and
compatibility with subgroup structures.

Conclusion: 动态熵为量子系统信息获取提供了新视角，相关结果对纯化率也有启示。

Abstract: We introduce a simple definition of dynamical entropy for quantum systems
under continuous monitoring, inspired by Connes, Narnhofer and Thirring. It
quantifies the amount of information gained about the initial condition. A
nonzero entropy rate can be obtained by monitoring the thermal fluctuation of
an extensive observable in a generic many-body system (away from classical or
large N limit). We explicitly compute the entropy rate in the thermodynamic and
long-time limit, in terms of the two-point correlation functions. We conjecture
a universal Planckian bound for the entropy rate. Related results on the
purification rate are also obtained.

Conclusion: 该框架适用于实验平台（如腔量子电动力学和光子晶体电路），为开放量子系统的基态问题提供了稳定且物理可实现的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a variational framework for solving ground-state problems of open
quantum systems governed by quantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs).
This formulation naturally accommodates bosonic operators, as commonly
encountered in quantum chemistry and quantum optics. By parameterizing a
dissipative quantum optical system, we minimize its steady-state energy to
approximate the ground state of a target Hamiltonian. The system converges to a
unique steady state regardless of its initial condition, and the design
inherently guarantees physical realizability. To enhance robustness against
persistent disturbances, we incorporate H-infinity control into the system
architecture. Numerical comparisons with the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA) highlight the method's structural advantages, stability, and
physical implementability. This framework is compatible with experimental
platforms such as cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and photonic crystal
circuits.

Abstract: We present a general and simple formula for computing the entanglement
negativity in free fermions. Our formula allows for deriving several universal
bounds on negativity and its rate of change in dynamics. The bound on
negativity directly relates the clustering property of correlations in
free-fermion states to the entanglement area law, and provides the optimal
condition for the area law in mixed free fermion states with long-range
correlations. In addition, we establish an area-law bound on entanglement
generation in open systems, analogous to previously known results for
entanglement entropy in unitary dynamics. Our work provides new analytical
insights into fermionic mixed-state entanglement.

Abstract: Cluster states are a useful resource in quantum computation, and can be
generated by applying entangling gates between next-neighbor qubits. Heralded
entangling gates offer the advantage of high post-selected fidelity, and can be
used to create cluster states at the expense of large space-time overheads. We
propose a low-overhead protocol to generate and merge high-fidelity many-atom
entangled states into a 3D cluster state that supports fault-tolerant universal
logical operations. Our simulations indicate that a state-of-the-art
high-finesse optical cavity is sufficient for constructing a scalable
fault-tolerant cluster state with loss and Pauli errors remaining an order of
magnitude below their respective thresholds. This protocol reduces the
space-time resource requirements for cluster state construction, highlighting
the measurement-based method as an alternative approach to achieving
large-scale error-corrected quantum processing with neutral atoms.

Conclusion: 该模型为强关联体系中约瑟夫森效应的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Bosons with density-dependent hopping on a one dimensional lattice have been
shown to emulate anyonic particles with fractional exchange statistics.
Leveraging this, we construct a Josephson junction setup, where an insulating
barrier in the form of a Mott-insulator is sandwiched between two superfluid
phases. This is obtained by spatially varying either the statistical phase or
the strength of the on-site interaction potential on which the ground state of
the system depends. Utilizing numerical methods such as exact diagonalization
and density renormalization group theory, the ground state properties of this
setup are investigated to understand the Josephson effect in a strongly
correlated regime. The dynamical properties of this model for different
configurations of this model are analyzed to find the configurations that can
produce the Josephson effect. Furthermore, it is observed that continuous
particle flow over time is achievable in this proposed model solely by creating
an initial phase difference without any external biasing.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum behavior of a charm-anticharm bound system under
the influence of a magnetic field within the symplectic formulation of Quantum
Mechanics. Employing a perturbative approach, we obtain the ground and first
excited states of the system described by the Cornell potential, which
incorporates both confining and nonconfining interactions. After perfoming a
Bohlin mapping in phase space, we solve the time-independent symplectic
Pauli-Schr\"odinger-type equation and determine the corresponding Wigner
function. Special attention is given to the observation of the confinement of
the quark-antiquark (meson $c\overline{c}$) that is revealed in the phase space
structure. And the introduction of spin effect (external magnetic field) in
modifying the quantum characteristics of the system. Our results reveal that
the magnetic enhances the negativity of the Wigner function, signaling stronger
quantum interference and a departure from classical behavior. The negativity
thus serve as a quantitative measure of the system's non-classicality. In
addition we have computed the mass spectra of the $c\overline{c}$ meson and
present result are in agreement with experimental data, improving previous
theoretical studies.

Result: 实验数据对玻姆力学无挑战，两种解释预测相同的光子隧穿行为。

Conclusion: 实验结论不成立，玻姆力学与哥本哈根解释在光子隧穿中一致。

Abstract: Very recently, Sharoglazova et al. performed an experiment measuring the
energy-velocity relationship and Bohmian velocity in coupled waveguides. Their
data show a discrepancy between the semi-classical `speed'
$v=\sqrt{2|\Delta|/m}$ and Bohmian velocity $v_s$ for $\Delta<-\hbar J_0$,
leading them to claim a challenge to Bohmian mechanics. Here, we definitively
demonstrate this experiment poses no challenge to Bohmian mechanics. First, $v$
and $v_S$ represent fundamentally distinct physical quantities -- comparing
them is physically unjustified and cannot adjudicate between Copenhagen and
Bohmian interpretations. Second, we rigorously show that both interpretations
predict identical photon tunneling dynamics in coupled waveguides.

Conclusion: 极化Houston基是模拟光驱动开放量子材料中非平衡现象的有力工具。

Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework -- the polarized Houston basis -- to
model nonequilibrium dynamics in driven open quantum systems, formulated for
use within the quantum master equation. This basis extends conventional Houston
states by incorporating field-induced polarization effects, enabling a more
accurate description of excitation dynamics under external driving. Using a
one-dimensional dimer-chain model, we examine band population dynamics through
projections onto polarized Houston states, original Houston states, and naive
Bloch states. We find that the polarized Houston basis significantly suppresses
spurious Bloch-state excitations and virtual transitions present in standard
Houston approaches, allowing for a cleaner extraction of real excitations. When
implemented in the relaxation time approximation of the quantum master
equation, this formalism also yields a substantial reduction of unphysical DC
currents in insulating systems. Our results highlight the polarized Houston
basis as a powerful tool for simulating nonequilibrium phenomena in
light-driven open quantum materials.

Abstract: This third paper in this series continues the investigation of atom-field
interactions in the presence of a conductor or a dielectric medium, focusing on
quantum information related basic issues such as decoherence and entanglement.
Here we consider the entanglement between two atoms with internal degrees of
freedom modeled by a harmonic oscillator, with varying separations between them
and varying distances between them and a conducting surface. These are
configurations familiar in the Casimir-Polder effect, but the behavior of
atom-surface entanglement is quite different from the well-studied behavior of
field-induced forces. For one, while the attractive force between an atom and a
conducting surface increases as they come closer, the entanglement between the
atom and the quantum field actually decreases as the atom gets closer to the
conductor, as shown in \cite{Rong,AFD2}. We show how different factors play
out, ranging from the coupling between the atoms and the field to the coupling
between the atoms, going beyond the weak coupling restrictions often found
necessary in the literature. Gathering our results for the entanglement
dependence on each variable concerned, we can provide a spatial topography of
quantum entanglement, thus enabling a visualized understanding of the behavior
of quantum field-mediated entanglement. In particular we can quantify the
definition of a three-dimensional \textit{entanglement domain} between the two
atoms, how it varies with their coupling, their separation and their distances
from the conducting surface, and for practical applications, how to exercise
effective control of the entanglement between two atoms by changing these
parameters. Our findings are expected to be useful for studies of
atom-field-medium interactions in vacuum and surface physics.

Abstract: Gaussian states hold a fundamental place in quantum mechanics, quantum
information, and quantum computing. Many subfields, including quantum
simulation of continuous-variable systems, quantum chemistry, and quantum
machine learning, rely on the ability to accurately and efficiently prepare
states that reflect a Gaussian profile in their probability amplitudes.
Although Gaussian states are natural in continuous-variable systems, the
practical interest in digital, gate-based quantum computers demands discrete
approximations of Gaussian distributions over a computational basis of size
\(2^n\). Because of the exponential scaling of naive amplitude-encoding
approaches and the cost of certain block-encoding or Hamiltonian simulation
techniques, a resource-efficient preparation of approximate Gaussian states is
required. In this work, we propose and analyze a circuit-based approach that
starts with single-qubit rotations to form an exponential amplitude profile and
then applies the quantum Fourier transform to map those amplitudes into an
approximate Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that this procedure achieves
high fidelity with the target Gaussian state while allowing optional pruning of
small controlled-phase angles in the quantum Fourier transform, thus reducing
gate complexity to near-linear in \(\mathcal{O}(n)\). We conclude that the
proposed technique is a promising route to make Gaussian states accessible on
noisy quantum hardware and to pave the way for scalable implementations on
future devices. The implementation of this algorithm is available at the
Classiq library: https://github.com/classiq/classiq-library.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analytical study that extends the conventional
formulation of Berry curvature, highlighting its derivation in the context of
problematic domains of definition of the operators. Our analysis reveals that
handling these domains carefully can have a substantial impact on Berry
curvature, demonstrating that even Hamiltonians without explicit parameter
dependence may exhibit nonzero Berry curvature. This finding emphasizes that
Berry curvature is intrinsically related to the eigenvectors rather than the
Hamiltonian itself. Our approach utilizes the standard Bloch (k-space)
framework for spatially periodic systems, illustrating these effects from first
principles and discussing potential implications for solid-state systems.

Motivation: 探索准晶结构中不同于传统体-边界对应的拓扑态，特别是体局域输运态（BLT态）的性质及其识别方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于交叉标记和鲁棒性分析的算法，并将其应用于Hofstadter模型在Ammann-Beenker拼图上的研究。

Result: BLT态主要在特定磁通区间内出现，具有与边缘态不同的性质，如局域化特性和能量谱中的分布模式。

Conclusion: BLT态的发现为准晶拓扑态的研究提供了新视角，其独特的局域化和能量分布特性可能具有更高的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In contrast to the usual bulk-boundary correspondence, topological states
localized within the bulk of the system have been numerically identified in
quasicrystalline structures, termed bulk localized transport (BLT) states.
These states exhibit properties different from edge states, one example being
that the number of BLT states scales with system size, while the number of edge
states scales with system perimeter. Here, we define an algorithm to identify
BLT states, which is based on the physically motivated crosshair marker and
robustness analyses. Applying the algorithm to the Hofstadter model on the
Ammann-Beenker tiling, we find that the BLT states appear mainly for magnetic
fluxes within a specific interval. While edge states appear at low densities of
states, we find that BLT states can appear at many different densities of
states. Many of the BLT states are found to have real-space localization that
follows geometric patterns characteristic of the given quasicrystal.
Furthermore, BLT states can appear both isolated and in groups within the
energy spectrum which could imply greater robustness for the states within such
groups. The spatial localization of the states within a certain group can
change depending on the Fermi energy.

Conclusion: 该架构为硬件开发者提供了一种高效的早期容错量子计算机设计方向。

Abstract: We present an architecture for early fault-tolerant quantum computers based
on the smallest interesting colour code (Earl Campbell, 2016). It realizes a
universal logical gate set consisting of single-qubit measurements and
preparations in the X and Z bases, single-qubit Hadamard (H) gates, and
three-qubit controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ) gates. State teleportations between
[[4, 2, 2]] (2D) and [[8, 3, 2]] (3D) error-detecting color codes allow one to
make use of the respective transversal H and CCZ gates that these codes
possess. As such, minimizing the number of logical quantum teleportation
operations, not the number of logical quantum non-Clifford gates, is the
relevant optimization goal. To help hardware developers characterize this
architecture, we also provide an experimental protocol tailored to testing
logical quantum circuits expressed in it.

Abstract: Levitated optomechanics, the interaction between light and small levitated
objects, is a new macroscopic quantum system that is being used as a testing
ground for fundamental physics and for the development of sensors with
exquisite sensitivity. The utility of this system, when compared to other
quantum optomechanical systems, is its extreme isolation from the environment
and, by the relatively few degrees of freedom that a levitated object has.
While work in the field has strongly focused on the three translational degrees
of freedom of this system, it has become increasingly important to understand
the induced rotational motion of levitated objects, particularly in optical
trapping fields, but also in magnetic and electric traps. These additional
three degrees of freedom, which are intrinsic to levitated systems, offer a new
set of optomechanical nonlinear interactions that lead to a rich and yet
largely unexplored roto-translational motion. The control and utilization of
these interactions promise to extend the utility of levitated optomechanics in
both fundamental studies and applications. In this review, we provide an
overview of levitated optomechanics, before focusing on the roto-translational
motion of optically levitated anisotropic objects. We first present a classical
treatment of this induced motion, bridging the gap between classical and
quantum formalisms. We describe the different types of roto-translational
motion for different particle shapes via their interaction with polarized
optical trapping fields. Subsequently, we provide an overview of the
theoretical and experimental approaches as well as applications that have
established this new field. The review concludes with an outlook of promising
experiments and applications, including the creation of non-classical states of
roto-translational motion, quantum-limited torque sensing and particle
characterization methods.

Abstract: Corresponding to a finite dimensional Hilbert space $H$ with $\dim H=n$, we
define a geometric algebra $\gscript (H)$ with $\dim\sqbrac{\gscript (H)}=2^n$.
The algebra $\gscript (H)$ is a Hilbert space that contains $H$ as a subspace.
We interpret the unit vectors of $H$ as states of individual fermions of the
same type and $\gscript (H)$ as a fermion quantum field whose unit vectors
represent states of collections of interacting fermions. We discuss creation
operators on $\gscript (H)$ and provide their matrix representations. Evolution
operators provided by self-adjoint Hamiltonians on $H$ and $\gscript (H)$ are
considered. Boson-Fermion quantum fields are constructed. Extensions of
operators from $H$ to $\gscript (H)$ are studied. Finally, we present a
generalization of our work to infinite dimensional separable Hilbert spaces.

Abstract: Single photons source (SPS) is a key component required by quantum

lines observed within the 500-800 nm range in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of
the surface layer of untreated Yakut diamonds rich in nitrogen and hydrogen
belong to SPS. Moreover, unknown narrow-line PL observed earlier in nitrogen-
and hydrogen-rich diamonds from various deposits around the world are thought
to be associated with SPS. Thus, the diamond rim, which until now was sent to
the dumps or, at best, used as an abrasive powder, turned out to be a valuable
material suitable for use in quantum technologies.

Conclusion: QMSE是一种可扩展且可解释的编码框架，有望推动分子数据集在QML中的实际应用。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has great potential for the analysis of
chemical datasets. However, conventional quantum data-encoding schemes, such as
fingerprint encoding, are generally unfeasible for the accurate representation
of chemical moieties in such datasets. In this contribution, we introduce the
quantum molecular structure encoding (QMSE) scheme, which encodes the molecular
bond orders and interatomic couplings expressed as a hybrid Coulomb-adjacency
matrix, directly as one- and two-qubit rotations within parameterised circuits.
We show that this strategy provides an efficient and interpretable method in
improving state separability between encoded molecules compared to other
fingerprint encoding methods, which is especially crucial for the success in
preparing feature maps in QML workflows. To benchmark our method, we train a
parameterised ansatz on molecular datasets to perform classification of state
phases and regression on boiling points, demonstrating the competitive
trainability and generalisation capabilities of QMSE. We further prove a
fidelity-preserving chain-contraction theorem that reuses common substructures
to cut qubit counts, with an application to long-chain fatty acids. We expect
this scalable and interpretable encoding framework to greatly pave the way for
practical QML applications of molecular datasets.

Motivation: 探索固态氖表面电子电荷量子比特的长相干时间背后的机制，以指导实验改进。

Method: 通过理论研究分析在10 mK温度下，由声子引起的氖表面位移和介电常数调制对相干时间的影响。

Result: 随着量子比特频率从1 GHz增至10 GHz，相干时间从366 s降至7 ms（表面位移机制）和27 s降至0.3 ms（介电常数调制机制）。

Conclusion: 理论计算的相干时间远高于实验观测值，表明实验仍有较大改进空间。

Abstract: Recent experiments show ~0.1 ms coherence time for a single electron charge
qubit on a solid neon surface. This remarkably long coherence time is believed
to result from the intrinsic purity of solid neon as a qubit host. In this
paper, we present theoretical studies on the decoherence mechanisms of an
electron's charge (lateral motional) states on solid neon. At the typical
experimental temperature of ~10 mK, the two main decoherence mechanisms are the
phonon-induced displacement of the neon surface and the phonon-induced
modulation of the neon permittivity (dielectric constant). With a qubit
frequency increasing from 1 GHz to 10 GHz, the charge coherence time decreases
from about 366 s to 7 ms, and from about 27 s to 0.3 ms, respectively, limited
by the two mechanisms above. The calculated coherence times are at least one
order longer than the observed ones at ~6.4 GHz qubit frequency, suggesting
plenty of room for experimental improvement.

Method: 使用Bogoliubov变换求解btpQRM和dtpQRM的精确解，分析谱塌缩、EPs和简并点，并通过双正交保真度敏感性和c积分类能级交叉。

Result: btpQRM中观察到谱塌缩和PT对称性破缺，dtpQRM中存在EPs和Juddian型简并，动力学演化路径不同。

Conclusion: 精确表征了PT对称非厄米双光子量子Rabi模型，为未来实验提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We investigate two non-Hermitian two-photon quantum Rabi models (tpQRM) that
exhibit $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry: the biased tpQRM (btpQRM), in which the qubit
bias is purely imaginary, and the dissipative tpQRM (dtpQRM), where the
two-photon coupling is made imaginary to introduce dissipation. For both
models, we derive exact solutions by employing Bogoliubov transformations. In
the btpQRM, we identify spectral collapse at a critical coupling strength, with
accompanying $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking that correlates with exceptional
points (EPs) arising from coalescing eigenstates. We establish a direct
correspondence between $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regions and the doubly degenerate
points of the Hermitian tpQRM, and analyze the effects of qubit bias via an
adiabatic approximation. In the dtpQRM, although no spectral collapse occurs,
both EPs and Juddian-type degeneracies are present, with well-separated
behaviors distinguished by parity conservation. Through biorthogonal fidelity
susceptibility and c-product, we successfully identify and classify the nature
of these two types of level crossings. Finally, we compare the dynamical
evolution of both models, revealing fundamentally different pathways to steady
states governed by their respective non-Hermitian spectral structures. Our
results provide exact characterizations of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
non-Hermitian tpQRMs and may offer theoretical insights for future experimental
realizations.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms have gained increasing attention for addressing complex

systematically benchmarks two prominent variational quantum approaches,
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA), under diverse experimental settings, including different
asset universes, ansatz architectures, and circuit depths. Although both
methods demonstrate effective cost function minimization, the resulting
portfolios often violate essential financial criteria, such as adequate

computational optimization and practical viability, we introduce an Expert

economic soundness and the market feasibility of quantum-optimized portfolios.
Our results highlight a critical disparity between algorithmic performance and
financial applicability, emphasizing the necessity of incorporating expert

Conclusion: 新阈值优化了性能，未来可进一步调整自由度以适用于更多系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an expansion of the Expected Maximum Improvement
over Confident Regions (EMICoRe) Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) -- a
technique advanced by Nicoli et al., which utilizes both quantum and classical
components to approximate the ground state of a quantum system -- by
introducing an alternative threshold for EMICoRe's Confident Region that
depends on both the Gaussian process (GP) prior variance and the model's change
in predicted energy over a set number of iterations. This modification is a
more lenient threshold for the Confident Region and accounts for natural
fluctuations in the predicted energy that EMICoRe punishes by eliminating the
exploratory benefits presented by the Confident Region. We test both algorithms
with the original EMICoRe model as a baseline and our results suggest
improvement over EMICoRe's state-of-the-art results for a common benchmark for
VQEs, the Ising Hamiltonian, and similar performance for more complex
optimization regimes. We analyze the accuracy in approximated ground state
energy and how the threshold evolves during optimization to compare the EMICoRe
model with the proposed alternative. After comparison, we discuss the potential
optimization of the degrees of freedom present in the new threshold for better
performance and a more varied choice of system to be approximated.

Conclusion: 非均匀网格和transcorrelated方法为量子化学计算提供了更高效的框架，有望在量子硬件上实现高精度模拟。

Abstract: First-quantized, real-space formulations of quantum chemistry on quantum
computers are appealing: qubit count scales logarithmically with spatial
resolution, and Coulomb operators achieve quadratic instead of quartic
computational scaling of two-electron interactions. However, existing schemes
employ uniform discretizations, so the resolution required to capture
electron-nuclear cusps in high-density regions oversamples low-density regions,
wasting computational resources. We address this by deploying non-uniform,
molecule-adaptive grids that concentrate points where electronic density is
high. Using Voronoi partitions of these grids, the molecular Hamiltonian is
expressed in a Hermitian form and in a transcorrelated, isospectral form that
eliminates Coulomb singularities and yields cusp-free eigenfunctions. Both
formulations slot naturally into quantum eigenvalue solvers: Hermitian Quantum
Phase Estimation (QPE) and the recent generalised Quantum Eigenvalue Estimation
(QEVE) protocol for its non-Hermitian, transcorrelated counterpart. Numerical
validation on benchmark systems confirms that this non-heuristic ab initio
framework offers a promising path for accurate ground-state chemistry on
quantum hardware.

Abstract: We investigate how accidental counts, the detection events not originating
from genuine entangled photon pairs, impact the observed violation of Bell
inequalities in photonic experiments. These false coincidences become
increasingly significant at higher laser pump powers, limiting the strength of
Bell violations and thus the performance of quantum protocols such as
device-independent quantum random number generation and quantum key
distribution. We propose a simple noise model that quantitatively links the
Bell value to the pump strength. Using experimental data from recent SPDC-based
Bell tests, we fit the model to a Bell expression, and demonstrate accurate
prediction of Bell values across a range of pump settings. Our results provide
practical guidance for optimizing source brightness while preserving quantum
nonlocality, with direct implications for high-rate, secure quantum
technologies.

Conclusion: FSR方法为量子计算在CAE中的应用提供了可行的解决方案，保留了量子优势。

Abstract: Applying quantum computing in the computer-aided engineering (CAE) problems
are highly expected since quantum computers yield potential exponential
speedups for the operations between extremely large matrices and vectors.
Although efficient quantum algorithms for the above problems have been
intensively investigated, it remains a crucial task to extract all the
grid-point values encoded in the prepared quantum states, which was believed to
eliminate the achieved quantum advantage. In this paper, we propose a
quantum-classical hybrid Fourier space readout (FSR) method to efficiently
recover the underlying function from its corresponding quantum state. We
provide explicit quantum circuits, followed by theoretical and numerical
discussions on its complexity. In particular, the complexity on quantum
computers has only a logarithmic dependence on the grid number, while the
complexity on classical computers has a linear dependence on the number of
target points instead of the grid number. Our result implies that the achieved
quantum speedups are not necessarily ruined when we read out the solutions to
the CAE problems.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the incompatibility of random quantum
measurements. Most previous work has focused on characterizing the maximal
amount of white noise that any fixed number of incompatible measurements with a
fixed number of outcomes in a fixed dimension can tolerate before becoming
compatible. This can be used to quantify the maximal amount of incompatibility
available in such systems. The present article investigates the incompatibility
of several classes of random measurements, i.e., the generic amount of
incompatibility available. In particular, we show that for an appropriate
choice of parameters, both random dichotomic projective measurements and random
basis measurements are close to being maximally incompatible. We use the
technique of incompatibility witnesses to certify incompatibility and combine
it with tools from random matrices and free probability.

Abstract: We present the simulation of the quench dynamics of the Z3 Schwinger model,
that describes an approximation of one-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics, on

dynamical quantum phase transitions. In order to reach long-time dynamics, we
exploit an enconding dictated by the symmetries, combined with a circuit
compression procedure. We focus on a quench that evolves the Dirac vacuum by
means of a Hamiltonian depending on a negative mass parameter. This leads to
resonant Rabi oscillations between the Dirac vacuum and mesonic states. The
population concentration exhibits oscillations with negligible fluctuations of
detuned states also with the inclusion of combined noise sources, from which we

Abstract: Tensor networks have proven to be a valuable tool, for instance, in the
classical simulation of (strongly correlated) quantum systems. As the size of
the systems increases, contracting larger tensor networks becomes
computationally demanding. In this work, we study distributed memory
architectures intended for high-performance computing implementations to solve
this task. Efficiently distributing the contraction task across multiple nodes
is critical, as both computational and memory costs are highly sensitive to the
chosen partitioning strategy. While prior work has employed general-purpose
hypergraph partitioning algorithms, these approaches often overlook the
specific structure and cost characteristics of tensor network contractions. We
introduce a simulated annealing-based method that iteratively refines the
partitioning to minimize the total operation count, thereby reducing
time-to-solution. The algorithm is evaluated on MQT Bench circuits and achieves
an 8$\times$ average reduction in computational cost and an 8$\times$ average
reduction in memory cost compared to a naive partitioning.

Abstract: Utility-scale quantum programs contain operations on the order of $>10^{15}$
which must be prepared and piped from a classical co-processor to the control
unit of the quantum device. The latency of this process significantly increases
with the size of the program: existing high-level classical representations of
quantum programs are typically memory intensive and do not na\"ively
efficiently scale to the degree required to execute utility-scale programs in
real-time. To combat this limitation, we propose the utilization of high-level
quantum circuit caches and compressors. The first save on the time associated
with repetitive tasks and sub-circuits, and the latter are useful for
representing the programs/circuits in memory-efficient formats. We present
numerical evidence that caches and compressors can offer five orders of
magnitude lower latencies during the automatic transpilation of extremely large
quantum circuits.

Abstract: Compiling quantum circuits to account for hardware restrictions is an
essential part of the quantum computing stack. Circuit compilation allows us to
adapt algorithm descriptions into a sequence of operations supported by real
quantum hardware, and has the potential to significantly improve their
performance when optimization techniques are added to the process. One such
optimization technique is reducing the number of quantum gates that are needed
to execute a circuit. For instance, methods for reducing the number of
non-Clifford gates or CNOT gates from a circuit is an extensive research area
that has gathered significant interest over the years. For certain hardware
platforms such as ion trap quantum computers, we can leverage some of their
special properties to further reduce the cost of executing a quantum circuit in
them. In this work we use global interactions, such as the Global
M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate present in ion trap hardware, to optimize and
synthesize quantum circuits. We design and implement an algorithm that is able
to compile an arbitrary quantum circuit into another circuit that uses global
gates as the entangling operation, while optimizing the number of global
interactions needed. The algorithm is based on the ZX-calculus and uses an
specialized circuit extraction routine that groups entangling gates into Global
M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates. We benchmark the algorithm in a variety of
circuits, and show how it improves their performance under state-of-the-art
hardware considerations in comparison to a naive algorithm and the Qiskit
optimizer.

Abstract: Spin-phonon interaction is known to drive magnetic relaxation in solid-state
systems, but little evidence is available on how it affects coherence time.
Here we extend fourth-order quantum master equations to account for coherence
terms and describe the full effect of up to two-phonon processes on spin
dynamics. We numerically implement this method fully ab initio for a
single-molecule magnet with large magnetization blocking temperature and show
that while strong axial magnetic anisotropy ensures slow magnetic relaxation
approaching seconds at 77 K, the superposition of Kramers doublets is coherent
for less than 10 ns due to a novel two-phonon pure dephasing mechanism.

Conclusion: 有限热力学资源限制了理想主体间性，但通过冷却或粗粒化可逼近理想状态，为量子热力学与经典性涌现的联系提供了新视角。

Abstract: Ideal quantum measurement requires divergent thermodynamic resources. This is
a consequence of the third law of thermodynamics, which prohibits the
preparation of the measurement pointer in a fully erased, pure state required
for the acquisition of perfect, noiseless measurement information. In this
work, we investigate the consequences of finite resources in the emergence of
intersubjectivity as a model for measurement processes with multiple observers.
Here, intersubjectivity refers to a condition in which observers agree on the
observed outcome (agreement), and their local random variables exactly
reproduce the original random variable for the system observable (probability
reproducibility). While agreement and reproducibility are mutually implied in
the case of ideal measurement, finite thermodynamic resources constrain each of
them. Starting from the third law of thermodynamics, we derive how the
achievability of ideal intersubjectivity is affected by restricted
thermodynamic resources. Specifically, we establish a no-go theorem concerning
perfect intersubjectivity and present a deviation metric to account for the
influence of limited resources. We further present attainable bounds for the
agreement and bias that are exclusively dependent on the initial state of the
environment. In addition, we show that either by cooling or coarse-graining, we
can approximate ideal intersubjectivity even with finite resources. This work
bridges quantum thermodynamics and the emergence of classicality in the form of
intersubjectivity.

Conclusion: 该理论兼具数学严谨性和广泛适用性，为科学界提供了新的工具来描述矩阵的动态行为。

Abstract: Matrix theory, foundational in diverse fields such as mathematics, physics,
and computational sciences, typically categorizes matrices based strictly on
their invertibility-determined by a sharply defined singular or nonsingular
classification. However, such binary classifications become inadequate in
describing matrices whose elements vary continuously over time, thereby
transitioning through intermediate states near singular configurations. To
address this fundamental limitation, we develop a rigorous and original
mathematical theory termed Continuity Norm Framework for the Evolution of
Nonsingular Matrices. Within this framework, we introduce a novel mathematical
structure enabling continuous and differentiable transitions between singular
and nonsingular matrix states, explicitly governed by a specialized continuity
norm and evolution operators derived through a well-defined differential
formulation. Our theoretical formalism rigorously quantifies the proximity of a
matrix to singularity, alongside its temporal evolution, through precisely
constructed functional relationships involving determinants and their time
derivatives. Furthermore, we elucidate the direct applicability and relevance
of our approach to physical systems by demonstrating how our formalism can
seamlessly describe continuous quantum state transitions-scenarios frequently
encountered but insufficiently captured by existing matrix theory. The theory
presented herein is meticulously constructed to maintain mathematical
exactitude, comprehensive rigor, and broad accessibility, bridging advanced
mathematical innovation and clear interpretability for the wider scientific
community.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms are of great interest for their possible use in
optimization problems. In particular, variational algorithms that use classical
counterparts to optimize parameters hold promise for use in currently existing
devices. However, convergence stagnation phenomena pose a challenge for such
algorithms. Seeking to avoid such difficulties, we present a framework based on
circuits with variable topology with two approaches, one based on ansatz-free
evolutionary method known from literature and the other using an introduction
of an ansatz with circuital structure inspired by the physics of the
Hamiltonian related to the problem, considering a, named here,
pseudo-counterdiabatic evolutionary term. The efficiency of the proposed
framework was tested on several instances of the set partitioning problem. The
two approaches were compared with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver in noisy
and non-noisy scenarios. The results demonstrated that optimization using
circuits with variable topology presented very encouraging results. Notably,
the strategy employing a pseudo-counterdiabatic evolutionary term exhibited
remarkable performance, avoiding convergence stagnation in most instances
considered. This framework circumvents the need for classical optimizers, and,
as a consequence, this procedure based on circuits with variable topology
indicates an interesting path in the search for algorithms to solve integer
optimization problems targeting efficient applications in larger-scale
scenarios.

Conclusion: 需改进设计以减少磁通捕获，优化悬浮性能。

Abstract: Magnetic levitation of superconductors is a promising platform to study
quantum mechanics in the large-mass limit. One major limitation is the weak
trapping potential, which results in low vibrational eigenfrequencies and
increased susceptibility to low-frequency noise. While generating strong
magnetic fields is relatively straightforward, creating a tightly confined
harmonic potential - essentially achieving a large magnetic field gradient -
remains a significant challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a potential
solution using superconducting cores that concentrate magnetic flux into
arbitrarily small volumes. We show the ability to trap superconducting
particles using an anti-Helmholtz coil configuration incorporating these cores.
However, we observe rapid damping of the levitated particle motion due to flux
trapping within the cores, occurring once the lower critical field is exceeded
locally. To investigate this mechanism, we employ diamond NV center
magnetometry and detect substantial remanent fields persisting after
high-current operation of the coils. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to
mitigate this effect and improve the levitation properties.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a foundational resource in quantum information
science, underpinning applications across physics. However, detecting and
quantifying entanglement remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a
variational quantum algorithm inspired by Uhlmann's theorem to quantify the
Bures entanglement of general quantum states, a method that naturally extends
to other quantum resources, including genuine multipartite entanglement,
quantum discord, quantum coherence, and total correlations, while also enabling
reconstruction of the closest free states. The algorithm requires a polynomial
number of ancillary qubits and circuit depth relative to the system size,
dimensionality, and free state cardinality, making it scalable for practical
implementations. Thus, it provides a versatile and efficient framework for
quantifying quantum resources, demonstrated through several applications.

Conclusion: 对齐分子中正交跃迁偶极可能导致BTH区域类似的相位和极化特征。

Abstract: We utilize few-level model systems to analyze the polarization and phase
properties of below-threshold harmonics (BTH) in aligned molecules. In a
two-level system (TLS), we find that the phase of emitted harmonics undergoes a
distinct change. For harmonics with photon energies below the transition
between the dominant field-dressed states, the phase alternates by $\pi$
between successive odd harmonic orders but remains constant above. Exploiting
this behavior, we construct a four-level model composed of two uncoupled TLS
subsystems aligned along orthogonal directions. We demonstrate that with
selected transition frequencies lower-order harmonics follow the polarization
of the linearly polarized driving field while higher-order harmonics exhibit a
mirrored polarization. The model predicts that aligned systems with orthogonal
transition dipoles may show analogous phase and polarization features in the
BTH regime.

Conclusion: FOQCS-LCU框架为高效块编码提供了新途径，适用于更广泛的结构化矩阵。

Abstract: As algorithmic tools exemplified by the Quantum Singular Value Transformation
(QSVT) continue to emerge as a unifying framework for diverse quantum speedups,
the efficient construction of block encodings--their fundamental input
model--becomes increasingly crucial. However, devising explicit block encoding
circuits remains a well-recognized and challenging problem. One of the most
widely studied and versatile approaches to block encoding is the Linear
Combination of Unitaries (LCU). Despite its generality, the practical use of
LCU is often limited by significant gate overhead, primarily stemming from the
multi-controlled gates required in the SELECT oracle. We introduce a compact
LCU formulation, dubbed FOQCS-LCU, which leverages the check matrix formalism
to implement a constant-depth SELECT oracle using a linear number of singly
controlled Pauli gates and ancillae. We demonstrate that, by exploiting the
structure of the problem, the cost of the state preparation oracle can also be
substantially reduced. We accomplish so by designing a parametrized family of
efficient Dicke state preparation routines. We construct explicit block
encoding circuits for representative spin models such as the Heisenberg and
spin glass Hamiltonians and provide detailed, non-asymptotic gate counts. Our
numerical benchmarks validate the efficiency of the FOQCS-LCU approach,
illustrating an order-of-magnitude improvement in CNOT count over conventional
LCU. This framework opens the door to efficient block encodings of a broad
class of structured matrices beyond those explored here.

Abstract: In this work, we present a new framework for a relativistic quantum analouge
of the classical Otto engine. Considering a single qubit as the working
substance, we analyse its interaction with a massless quantum scalar field
while undergoing two half-circular rotations at ultra-relativistic velocities.
The quantum vacuum serves as a thermal bath through the Unruh effect induced
due to the acceleration from the circular motions. We observe that the response
function of the qubit gets significantly modified by the presence of the
qubit's trajectory. Analysing the transition probability behaviour, we find
that in the high-acceleration regime, it asymptotically approaches a constant
value, determined solely by the properties of the correlation function.
Furthermore, our results emphasize the crucial role of the circular trajectory
in determining the engine's work output. In particular, the extracted work
increases with detector acceleration and approaches an asymptotic limit in the
high-acceleration regime. Notably, the efficiency of this model remains
unaffected by the circular motion and is consistent with previously studied
models.

Abstract: Quantum steering enables one party to influence another remote quantum state
by local measurement. While steering is fundamental to many quantum information
tasks, the existing detection methods in the literature are mainly constrained
to either specific measurement scenario or low-dimensional systems. In this
work, we propose a majorization lattice framework for steering detection, which
is capable of exploring the steering in arbitrary dimension and measurement
setting. Steering inequalities for two-qubit states, high-dimensional Werner
states and isotropic states are obtained, which set even stringent bars than
what have reached yet. Notably, the known high-dimensional results turn out to
be some kind of approximate limits of the new approach.

Abstract: We explore how the fundamental problems in quantum molecular dynamics can be
modelled using classical simulators (emulators) of quantum computers and the
actual quantum hardware available to us today. The list of problems we tackle
includes propagation of a free wave packet, vibration of a harmonic oscillator,
and tunneling through a barrier. Each of these problems starts with the initial
wave packet setup. Although Qiskit provides a general method for initializing
wavefunctions, in most cases it generates deep quantum circuits. While these
circuits perform well on noiseless simulators, they suffer from excessive noise
on quantum hardware. To overcome this issue, we designed a shallower quantum
circuit for preparing a Gaussian-like initial wave packet, which improves the
performance on real hardware. Next, quantum circuits are implemented to apply
the kinetic and potential energy operators for the evolution of a wavefunction
over time. The results of our modelling on classical emulators of quantum
hardware agree perfectly with the results obtained using the traditional
(classical) methods. This serves as a benchmark and demonstrates that the
quantum algorithms and Qiskit codes we developed are accurate. However, the
results obtained on the actual quantum hardware available today, such as IBM's
superconducting qubits and IonQ's trapped ions, indicate large discrepancies
due to hardware limitations. This work highlights both the potential and
challenges of using quantum computers to solve fundamental quantum molecular
dynamics problems.

Conclusion: 量子光学协议为浅层网络提供了一种高效且资源需求恒定的实现方式。

Abstract: Classical shallow networks are universal approximators. Given a sufficient
number of neurons, they can reproduce any continuous function to arbitrary
precision, with a resource cost that scales linearly in both the input size and
the number of trainable parameters. In this work, we present a quantum optical
protocol that implements a shallow network with an arbitrary number of neurons.
Both the input data and the parameters are encoded into single-photon states.
Leveraging the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, the network output is determined by the
coincidence rates measured when the photons interfere at a beam splitter, with
multiple neurons prepared as a mixture of single-photon states. Remarkably,
once trained, our model requires constant optical resources regardless of the
number of input features and neurons.

Abstract: It is demonstrated that identifying information-theoretic limitations of
quantum Bell nonlocality alone cannot completely distinguish quantum theory
from generalized nonsignaling theories. To this end, an information-theoretic
concept of certifying nonobjective information by the Popescu-Rohrlich box
fraction is employed. Furthermore, in the aforementioned demonstration, a
partial answer to the question of what distinguishes quantum theory from
generalized nonsignaling theories emerges beyond the one provided by the
principle of information causality alone. This is accomplished by demonstrating
that postquantum models identified by the information causality are isolated by
the emergence of the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction of nonobjective information
in Bell-local boxes of a generalized nonsignaling theory, over the two other
generalized nonsignaling theories that have simplicial local state spaces.

Abstract: In contrast to the neatly bounded spectra of densely populated large random
matrices, sparse random matrices often exhibit unbounded eigenvalue tails on
the real and imaginary axis, called Lifshitz tails. In the case of asymmetric
matrices, concise mathematical results have proved elusive. In this work, we
present an analytical approach to characterising these tails. We exploit the
fact that eigenvalues in the tail region have corresponding eigenvectors that
are exponentially localised on highly-connected hubs of the network associated
to the random matrix. We approximate these eigenvectors using a series
expansion in the inverse connectivity of the hub, where successive terms in the
series take into account further sets of next-nearest neighbours. By
considering the ensemble of such hubs, we are able to characterise the
eigenvalue density and the extent of localisation in the tails of the spectrum
in a general fashion. As such, we classify a number of different asymptotic
behaviours in the Lifshitz tails, as well as the leading eigenvalue and the
inverse participation ratio. We demonstrate how an interplay between matrix
asymmetry, network structure, and the edge-weight distribution leads to the
variety of observed behaviours.

Abstract: Molecular adsorption energy is a critical descriptor for high-throughput
screening of heterogeneous catalysts and electrode materials. However, precise
experimental adsorption energies are scarce due to the complexity of
experiments, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain
computationally expensive for large-scale material screening. Machine learning
models trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative, but face
challenges such as functional dependency, limited labeled high-fidelity data,
and interpretability issues. Herein, we present DOS Transformer for Adsorption
(DOTA), a novel deep learning model that leverages local density of states
(LDOS) as input to predict chemically accurate adsorption energies across
metallic and intermetallic surfaces. DOTA integrates multi-head self-attention
mechanisms with LDOS feature engineering to capture orbital interaction
patterns, achieving superior accuracy and transferability. Pretrained on
PBE-level DFT data, DOTA can be fine-tuned using minimal high-fidelity
experimental or hybrid functional data to predict adsorption energies with
chemical accuracy. The model resolves long-standing challenges, such as the "CO
puzzle" and outperforms traditional theories, like the d-band center and Fermi
softness models. It provides a robust framework for efficient catalyst and
electrode screening, bridging the gap between computational and experimental
approaches.

Abstract: Theoretical analysis of biological and artificial neural networks e.g.
modelling of synaptic or weight matrices necessitate consideration of the
generic real-asymmetric matrix ensembles, those with varying order of matrix
elements e.g. a sparse structure or a banded structure. We pursue the
complexity parameter approach to analyze the spectral statistics of the
multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of real asymmetric matrices and derive the
ensemble averaged spectral densities for real as well as complex eigenvalues.
Considerations of the matrix elements with arbitrary choice of mean and
variances render us the freedom to model the desired sparsity in the ensemble.
Our formulation provides a common mathematical formulation of the spectral
statistics for a wide range of sparse real-asymmetric ensembles and also
  reveals, thereby, a deep rooted universality among them.

Abstract: We show that interlayer excitons in double-layer semiconductor
heterostructures can form a Bose solid, which is an incompressible supersolid
characterized by exactly one boson per lattice site. This exciton Bose solid
would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the
generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases.
Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires
extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle
correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a
formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and
interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and
incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to
determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature
properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.

Conclusion: on-shell近似在弱相互作用下可作为有效工具，用于构建量子场论中的有效相互作用。

Abstract: We investigate the on-shell approximation in the context of s-wave scattering
for ultracold two-body collisions. Our analysis systematically covers spatial
dimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the
approximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction
potentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell
potentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering
problem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical
expressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct
comparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction
potential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision
momenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings
indicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with
increasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials.
Remarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell
approximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation
offers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the
potential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions
for quantum field theories.

Abstract: We analyze the zero energy collision of three identical bosons in the same
internal state with total orbital angular momentum $L=2$, assuming short range
interactions. By solving the Schr\"odinger equation asymptotically, we derive
two expansions of the wave function when three bosons are far apart or a pair
of bosons and the third boson are far apart. The scattering hypervolume $D$ is
defined for this collision. Unlike the scattering hypervolume defined by one of
us in 2008, whose dimension is length to the fourth power, the dimension of $D$
studied in the present paper is length to the eighth power. We then derive the
expression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's
expansion. We also calculate the energy shift of such three bosons with three
different momenta $\hbar \mathbf{k_{1}}$, $\hbar\mathbf{k_{2}}$ and
$\hbar\mathbf{k_{3}}$ in a large periodic box. The obtained energy shift
depends on $D^{(0)}/\Omega^{2}$ and $D/\Omega^{2}$, where $D^{(0)}$ is the
three-body scattering hypervolume defined for the three-body $L=0$ collision
and $\Omega$ is the volume of the periodic box. We also calculate the
contribution of $D$ to the three-body T-matrix element for low-energy
collisions. We then calculate the shift of the energy and the three-body
recombination rate due to $D^{(0)}$ and $D$ in the dilute homogeneous Bose gas.
The contribution to the three-body recombination rate constant from $D$ is
proportional to $T^2$ if the temperature $T$ is much larger than the quantum
degeneracy temperature but still much lower than the temperature scale at which
the thermal de Broglie wave length becomes comparable to the physical range of
interaction.

Abstract: Fluctuations are fundamental in physics and important for understanding and
characterizing phase transitions. In this spirit, the phase transition to the
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is of specific importance. Whereas fluctuations
of the condensate particle number in atomic BECs have been studied in
continuous systems, experimental and theoretical studies for lattice systems
were so far missing. Here, we explore the condensate particle number
fluctuations in an optical lattice BEC across the phase transition in a
combined experimental and theoretical study. We present both experimental data
using ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms and numerical simulations based on a hybrid
approach combining the Bogoliubov quasiparticle framework with a master
equation analysis for modeling the system. We find strongly anomalous
fluctuations, where the variance of the condensate number $\delta N_{\rm
BEC}^2$ scales with the total atom number as $N^{1+\gamma}$ with an exponent
around $\gamma_{\rm theo}=0.74$ and $\gamma_{\rm exp}=0.62$, which we attribute
to the 2D/3D crossover geometry and the interactions. Our study highlights the
importance of the trap geometry on the character of fluctuations and on
fundamental quantum mechanical properties.

Conclusion: 部分吸收目标导致电流涨落的交叉相关性，且吸收率显著影响涨落方差。

Abstract: We use macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to analyse current fluctuations
in a non-interacting Brownian gas with one or more partially absorbing targets
within a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \R^d$. We proceed by coarse-graining a
generalised Dean-Kawasaki equation with Robin boundary conditions at the target
surfaces. The exterior surface $\partial \Omega$ is maintained at a constant
density $\owp$. We first derive MFT equations for the optimal noise-induced
path for a single target under a saddle-point approximation of the associated
path integral action. We then obtain the Gaussian distribution characterising
small current fluctuations by linearising the MFT equations about the
corresponding deterministic or noise-averaged system and solving the resulting
stationary equations. The Robin boundary conditions are handled using the
spectrum of a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined on the target surface. We
illustrate the theory by considering the finite interval and a circular
annulus. In both cases we determine how the variance of the current depends on
the rate of absorption $\kappa$. Finally, we extend our analysis to multiple
partially absorbing targets. First, we obtain the general result that, in the
case of partially absorbing targets ($0<\kappa<\infty$), the covariance matrix
for current fluctuations supports cross correlations even in the absence of
particle interactions. (These cross-correlations vanish in the totally
absorbing limit $\kappa\rightarrow \infty$.) We then explicitly calculate the
covariance matrix for circular targets in a 2D domain by assuming that the
targets are much smaller than the characteristic size $L$ of the domain
$\Omega$ and applying methods from singular perturbation theory.

Abstract: The large-scale collective behavior of biological systems can be
characterized by macroscopic transport, which arises from the non-equilibrium
microscopic interactions among individual constituents. A prominent example is
the formation of dynamic aggregates by motile eukaryotic cells or bacteria
mediated by active contractile forces. In this work, we develop the
two-dimensional fluctuating hydrodynamics theory based on the microscopic
dynamics of a model system of aggregation by \textit{Neisseria gonorrhoeae}
bacteria. The derivation of two macroscopic transport coefficients of bulk
diffusivity and conductivity which determine hydrodynamic current of cells is
the central result of this work. By showing how transport coefficients depend
on cell density and microscopic parameters of the system we predict transport
slowdown during the colony formation process. This study provides valuable
analytical tools for quantifying hydrodynamic transport in experimental systems
involving cellular aggregation occurring due to intermittent contractile dipole
forces.

Abstract: This thesis explores a central question: how does memory affect the way
random walkers explore space? By analyzing various non-Markovian models, where
past behavior directly influences future dynamics, we uncover new mechanisms
and universal patterns in space exploration.
  In the first part, we study Locally Activated Random Walks (LARWs), where
motion depends on the time spent at visited sites. These walks, though simply
defined, display rich behaviors such as dynamical trapping, aging, and
non-Gaussian diffusion. We identify confinement criteria, reveal a dynamical
phase transition, and derive exact analytical results in several regimes.
  The second part focuses on Self-Interacting Random Walks (SIRWs), where the
walker's own history governs future steps. Using advanced probabilistic tools,
especially Ray-Knight theory, we compute exact results for observables such as
splitting probabilities, persistence, first-passage times, number of visited
sites, and aging effects. This includes the first exact expressions for aged
observables in the saturating Self-Attracting Walk (SATW) model.
  In the third part, we propose a unified framework to describe memory effects
in space exploration, based on the walker's tendency to reverse direction over
time. This approach reveals robust patterns across a wide class of
non-Markovian models, including fractional Brownian motion and the strongly
self-interacting True Self-Avoiding Walk (TSAW), where we derive the first
exact result for an aged observable in a non-saturating system.
  Together, these results show that memory-driven systems, though complex, can
exhibit universal structures. This work offers new tools to analyze such
dynamics and lays the groundwork for future research across physics,
probability, and beyond.

Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the
standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$
does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly
suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first
extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a
fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi,
it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki
of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or
higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and
Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the
conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our
proof.

Abstract: The dynamical evolution of the surface height is controlled by
  either a linear or a nonlinear Langevin equation, depending on the
  underlying microscopic dynamics, and is often done theoretically
  using stochastic coarse-grained growth equations. The persistence
  probability $p(t)$ of stochastic models of surface growth that are
  constrained by a finite system size is examined in this work. We
  focus on the linear Edwards-Wilkinson model (EW) and the nonlinear
  Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model, two specific models of surface
  growth. The persistence exponents in the continuum version of these
  two models have been widely investigated. Krug et al.[Phys. Rev. E ,
  56:2702-2712, (1997)] and Kallabis et al. [EPL (Europhysics Letters)
  , 45(1):20, 1999] had shown that, the steady-state persistence
  exponents for both these models are related to the growth exponent
  $\beta$ as $\theta=1-\beta$. It is numerically found that the values
  of persistence exponents for both these models are close to the
  analytically predicted values. While the results of the continuum
  equations of the surface growth are well known, we focus to study
  the persistence probability expressions for discrete models with a
  finite size effect. In this article, we have investigated the
  persistence probabilities for the linear Edwards-Wilkinson(EW) model
  and for the non-linear Kardar-Parisi-Zhang(KPZ) model of surface
  growth on a finite one-dimensional lattice. The interesting
  phenomenon which is found in this case is that the known scenario of
  $p(t)$ of the following algebraic decay vanishes as we introduce a
  finite system size.

Abstract: We introduce and study a non-equilibrium stochastic model of two fluctuating
interfaces which interact through short-range attractive interactions at their
points of contact. Beginning from an entangled state, the system exhibits
diverse dynamics -- ranging from fast transients with small lifetimes to
ultraslow evolution through quasi-stationary states -- and reaches stuck,
entangled, or detached steady states. Near the stuck-detached transition, two
distinct dynamical modes of evolution co-occur. When the two surfaces evolve
through similar dynamics (both Edwards-Wilkinson or both Kardar-Parisi-Zhang),
the invariant measure is determined and found to have an inhomogeneous product
form. This exact steady state is shown to be the measure of the equilibrium
Poland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation.

Abstract: Hyperuniform systems are distinguished by an unusually strong suppression of
large-scale density fluctuations and, consequently, display a high degree of
uniformity at the largest length scales. In some cases, however, enhanced
uniformity is expected to be present even at intermediate and possibly small
length scales. There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems,
where class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively.
We utilize the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window
of radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic
large-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We
find, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals,
disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a
faster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by
corrections with integer powers of $1/R$. Thus, we conclude this represents the
highest degree of effective uniformity from small to large length scales. Class
II systems, such as Fermi-sphere point processes, are characterized by
logarithmic $1/\ln(R)$ corrections and, consequently, a lower degree of local
uniformity. Class III systems, such as perturbed lattice patterns, present an
asymptotic scaling of $1/R^{\alpha}$, $0 < \alpha < 1$, implying, curiously, an
intermediate degree of local uniformity. In addition, our study provides
insight into when experimental and numerical finite systems are representative
of large-scale behavior. Our findings may thereby facilitate the design of
hyperuniform systems with enhanced physical properties arising from local
uniformity.

N^{-1/d}$, with lattice-dependent higher-order corrections. This scaling,
observed across structures from chains to FCC and diamond lattices, offers a
minimal framework to quantify geometric influences on entropy. The model
captures the order of magnitude of experimental residual entropies (e.g.,
$S_{\mathrm{molar}} = R \ln 12 \approx 20.7 \, \mathrm{J/mol \cdot K}$) and
provides a reference for understanding entropy-driven order in colloids,
clusters, and solids.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter
that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising
model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase
emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and
(low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier
duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a
finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to
characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary
conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by
boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous
symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension
of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide
numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their
corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete
phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous)
intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate
transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation.

Result: 发现节律性区域边界清晰，噪声可增强振荡规律性，且节律精确性与能量消耗成正比。

Conclusion: 研究证实了生物钟的稳健性、精确性和效率受普遍物理规律约束。

Abstract: Circadian rhythms in living organisms are temporal orders emerging from
biochemical circuits driven out of equilibrium. Here, we study how the
rhythmicity of a biochemical clock is shaped using the KaiABC system. A phase
diagram constructed as a function of KaiC and KaiA concentrations reveals a
sharply bounded limit-cycle region, which naturally explains arrhythmia upon
protein over-expression. Beyond the Hopf bifurcation, intrinsic noise enables
regular oscillation via coherence resonance. Within the limit-cycle region,
greater rhythmic precision incurs a higher energetic cost, following the
thermodynamic uncertainty relation. The cost-minimizing period of the KaiABC
clock ($\sim$21-hr) is close enough to entrain to 24-hr cycle of environment.
Our study substantiates universal physical constraints on the robustness,
precision, and efficiency of noisy biological clocks.

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the positional dynamics and average
thermodynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle subject to both, harmonic
confinement and annealed disorder due to a temporarily fluctuating trap
stiffness. We model this stiffness via a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)
process whose correlation time can be tuned from white noise to a quenched
limit. We analytically calculate the positional distribution in these limits
and provide exact expressions for the $n$th positional moments at finite
correlation times, revealing important insights regarding stationarity.
Further, we analyze the average work performed on the particle and the heat
dissipated into the environment at all times, illustrating the nonequilibrium
character of the system and its relaxation into a steady state. Our analytical
results are validated by numerical Langevin simulations.

Conclusion: 回旋共振是探测自旋子Landau量子化和规范场的有效实验手段，为量子自旋液体提供实验证据。

Abstract: We propose cyclotron resonance as an optical probe for emergent
fractionalized excitations in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum spin liquids, focusing on
kagome antiferromagnets. In contrast to conventional systems, where cyclotron
resonance directly couples to charged carriers, spinons in spin liquids are
charge-neutral and interact only through an emergent gauge field. We identify
two key mechanisms by which an external physical electromagnetic field induces
emergent electric and magnetic fields, enabling indirect coupling to spinons.
Using these mechanisms, we compute the absorption rate of the cyclotron
resonance response for Dirac spinons forming Landau levels. Our analysis shows
that, although the absorption per layer is small, the absence of a skin-depth
limitation in insulating spin liquids allows for cumulative absorption
comparable to graphene in realistic sample sizes for the recently discovered
spin-liquid candidate material
YCu${}_3$(OH)${}_6$Br${}_2$[Br${}_{1-y}$(OH)${}_y$]. Our findings shows that
cyclotron resonance is a viable experimental probe of spinon Landau
quantization and emergent gauge fields, providing powerful positive
experimental signatures of quantum spin liquids.

Conclusion: 研究结果支持了理论猜想，并为相关量子霍尔态相变提供了新见解。

Abstract: Gauge theories compose a large class of interacting conformal field theories
in 3d, among which an outstanding category is critical Chern-Simons-matter
theories. In this paper, we focus on one of the simplest instances: one complex
critical scalar coupled to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ Chern-Simons gauge field. It is
theoretically interesting as it is conjectured to exhibit dualities between
four simple Lagrangian descriptions, but also practically important as it
describes the transition between Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid (or
$\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state) and trivially gapped phase. Using the fuzzy
sphere regularisation, we realise this theory as a transition on the spherical
lowest Landau level between a $\nu_f=2$ fermionic integer quantum Hall state
and a $\nu_b=1/2$ bosonic fractional quantum Hall state. We show that this
transition is continuous and has emergent conformal symmetry. By studying the
operator spectrum, we show that there exists only one relevant singlet with
scaling dimension $\Delta_S=1.52(18)$. We also discuss other higher operators
and the consequences of our results.

Conclusion: 结论是LPFET为强关联系统提供了一种有效的局域势泛函嵌入方法，优于以往的密度嵌入方法。

Abstract: Localized orbital-based quantum embedding, as originally formulated in the
context of density matrix embedding theory (DMET), is revisited from the
perspective of lattice density functional theory (DFT). An in-principle exact
(in the sense of full configuration interaction) formulation of the theory,
where the occupations of the localized orbitals play the role of the density,
is derived for any (model or ab initio) electronic Hamiltonian. From this
general formalism we deduce an exact relation between the local
Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the full-size Kohn-Sham (KS)
lattice-like system and the embedding chemical potential that is adjusted on
each embedded fragment, individually, such that both KS and embedding cluster
systems reproduce the exact same local density. When well-identified
density-functional approximations (that find their justification in the
strongly correlated regime) are applied, a practical self-consistent local
potential functional embedding theory (LPFET), where the local Hxc potential
becomes the basic variable, naturally emerges from the theory. LPFET differs
from previous density embedding approaches by its fragment-dependent embedding
chemical potential expression, which is a simple functional of the Hxc
potential. Numerical calculations on prototypical systems show the ability of
such an ansatz to ease convergence and improve substantially the description of
density profiles (localized orbital occupations in this context) in strongly
correlated systems.

Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations are widely used to study spin
dynamics in Mott insulators. However, because energy dissipation is typically
introduced phenomenologically, its validity for describing nonequilibrium
processes and long-time dynamics in real materials remains questionable. In
this paper, we derive a generalized stochastic LLG equation from first
principles for spin-orbital coupled Mott insulators, explicitly incorporating
the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and lattice vibrations. Our
approach is based on the path-integral formalism formulated along the Keldysh
contour, which naturally accounts for dissipation and thermal fluctuations
through interactions with a phonon bath and emergent stochastic noise. We
benchmark our theoretical framework by numerically integrating the equations of
motion for a two-orbital spin chain coupled to Einstein phonons. The resulting
energy relaxation mimics realistic cooling dynamics, exhibits nontrivial
transient behavior during thermalization, and accurately reproduces
thermodynamic properties upon equilibration. This demonstrates the robustness
and reliability of our formalism for capturing both equilibrium and
nonequilibrium aspects of dissipative spin dynamics in strongly correlated
systems. We further show how electron-phonon coupling induces hybridization
between electronic and phononic modes in the excitation spectrum. Finally, we
demonstrate how the conventional LLG equations can be recovered as a limiting
case of our microscopic theory, and discuss their applicability to real
materials.

Abstract: We report thermodynamic, neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron
scattering measurements on Cs$_2$RuO$_4$, a member of the celebrated family of
frustrated magnets Cs$_2$MX$_4$ (M = Cu, Co, X = Br, Cl). Unlike the previously
studied members, it is based on $4d$ transition metal ions with $S=1$. Mapping
out the $H-T$ magnetic phase diagram reveals an unusual continuous
spin-flop-like phase transition associated with a quantum critical point within
the antiferromagnetically ordered phase. A quantitative analysis of the complex
magnetic excitation spectrum measured in zero field allows us to derive a model
magnetic Hamiltonian for this compound. Its main feature is a frustration of
magnetic anisotropy on a level that is much higher than in any of the
previously studied species. This frustration naturally explains the peculiar
phase transition observed.

Result: PT破缺相导致观测量和纠缠量的指数增长，而非相互作用费米子系统中TTC熵呈现线性衰减。

Conclusion: 双正交密度矩阵的非正定性是PT破缺相中指数增长的原因，而TTC熵的线性衰减源于双正交约化密度矩阵的近似谱对称性。

Abstract: We explore the quench dynamics of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian systems by
utilizing the biorthogonal formalism. We analyze quench dynamics of observable
quantities, the quantum geometric tensor, and various entanglement quantities,
including the entanglement entropy, the SVD entropy, and the Tu-Tzeng-Chang
entropy. Our results show that a sudden quench into a PT-broken phase generally
leads to exponential growth in these quantities, driven by the biorthogonal
density matrix's non-positivity. In contrast to generic interacting systems, we
observe a surprising linear decay in the TTC entropy for non-interacting
fermionic systems. This finding originates from the approximate spectral
symmetry of the biorthogonal reduced density matrix, and we confirm our
findings using the Yang-Lee and non-Hermitian XXZ models.

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the transverse field Ising
chain (TFIC) using time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS)
in a pump-probe setup within a condensed matter setting. The tr-RIXS spectra
reveal distinctive features, including two-kink continua at high energies and
oscillatory spectral weight at low energies, both strongly influenced by the
pump dynamics. By systematically analyzing the nonequilibrium tr-RIXS cross
section under various pump configurations, we demonstrate how the spectra
encode detailed information about the system's transient states, capturing
instantaneous Hamiltonian parameters and the traversal of equilibrium quantum
critical points during dynamic evolution. Notably, we uncover a one-to-one
correspondence between oscillatory features in the low-energy spectra and
dynamical quantum phase transitions, offering a novel and experimentally
accessible approach for their detection. These findings highlight the
versatility of tr-RIXS as a powerful tool for studying quantum systems far from
equilibrium and their critical phenomena.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了m=1/9平台的独特VBC态，并验证了RVB拟设对其他磁化平台的适用性。

Abstract: Numerical simulations find that there are multiple plateaus in the
magnetization curve of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kagome antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model(KAFH) at fractional magnetization $m=1/9,1/3,5/9,7/9$. While
it is well known that the $m=1/3,5/9,7/9$ plateau feature a
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ valence bond crystal(VBC) ordering pattern with a
David-star-shaped motif, the origin of the narrow plateau at $m=1/9$ remains
elusive. Some researchers claim that a subtle translational symmetry breaking
pattern with the same $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ periodicity occurs at the
$m=1/9$ plateau. On the other hand, it has also been argued that the $m=1/9$
plateau may harbor a novel $Z_{3}$ chiral spin liquid phase. To resolve this
controversy, we have proposed the most general variational ansatz based on the
resonating valence bond(RVB) picture that is consistent with the spin symmetry
of the system and developed a new algorithm to optimize such a complicated
ansatz. We find that a peculiar VBC state with a $3\times3$ periodicity and a
windmill-shaped motif has significantly lower energy than the claimed $Z_{3}$
chiral spin liquid state and other proposed VBC states around the $m=1/9$
plateau. We find that there are strong spatial modulation in the local
magnetization at the $1/9$ plateau, so strong that even its polarization can be
reversed. Our general RVB ansatz also well reproduces all other more
conventional magnetization plateaus of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ KAFH. We find
that the local magnetization is always strongly inhomogeneous below the
saturating field for such a strongly frustrated quantum magnet.

Abstract: We present a real-frequency third-order strong-coupling impurity solver which
employs quantics tensor cross interpolation (QTCI) for an efficient evaluation
of the diagram weights. Applying the method to dynamical mean-field theory
(DMFT) calculations of the single-band Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, we
clarify the interaction and temperature range in which the third-order approach
yields accurate results. Since the calculations are implemented on the
real-time/frequency axis, the detailed structure of spectral functions can be
obtained without analytical continuation, as we demonstrate with examples for
paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic and photo-doped states. Our work establishes a
viable path toward high-order, real-frequency impurity solvers for both

emerge in star-like systems with exponentially decaying couplings, as we show

Depending on the central connectivity, entanglement halos may exhibit trivial

how geometry and connectivity can generate complex entanglement structures with

Abstract: We study the model for spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a square
lattice in the presence of spin vacancies. In order to overcome the
methodological challenges associated with analyzing models with magnetic
frustration and inhomogeneities, we introduce a new semi-classical approach in
which singlet dimers are treated as effective classical degrees of freedom. The
energetic and entropic aspects of the dimer formation are included via a
classical Monte Carlo scheme that allows for the dynamical conversion of spin
pairs into dimers and vice versa. We show that our semi-classical approach
recovers the qualitative physics of the J1-J2 model in the absence of
vacancies. The vacancies lead to a broadening of the spin-liquid regime between
the N\'eel and the stripe antiferromagnetic phases. This suggests a possible
new route to discover spin-liquid ground states by tuning the J2/J1 ratio in
doped square lattice antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices enable engineering of correlated quantum states through
tunable periodic potentials, where twist angle controls periodicity but dynamic
potential strength modulation remains challenging. Here, we develop a
high-pressure quantum transport technique for van der Waals heterostructures,
achieving the ultimate pressure limit (~9 GPa) in encapsulated moir\'e devices.
In aligned graphene/h-BN, we demonstrate that pressure induces a substantial
enhancement of the moir\'e potential strength, evidenced by the suppression of
the first valence bandwidth and the near-doubling of the primary band gap.
Moreover, we report the first observation of a tertiary gap emerging above 6.4
GPa, verifying theoretical predictions. Our results establish hydrostatic
pressure as a universal parameter to reshape moir\'e band structures. By
enabling quantum transport studies at previously inaccessible pressure regimes,
this Letter expands the accessible parameter space for exploring correlated
phases in moir\'e systems.

method, high-temperature expansions series analysis, and quantum Monte Carlo
simulations to examine the effect of lattice geometry on the finite-temperature
properties. In particular, we have found that the Curie temperature $T_c$ for
the hyperkagome-lattice (frustrated lattice) ferromagnet is about $0.33\vert
J\vert$ that is smaller than $T_c$ for the diamond-lattice (another
three-dimensional lattice with the same coordination number 4 but bipartite
one) ferromagnet by about $25\%$.

Result: 强耦合下观察到单次或同时双次一级相变，并通过实验相关参数验证。

Conclusion: 研究为激光驱动CuGeO₃中的相变提供了理论支持和实验指导。

Abstract: We study a dimerized spin-1/2 chain, such as CuGeO$_3$, hosting triplon
excitations coupled to optical phonons under weak terahertz laser driving. Both
phonons and triplons weakly lose energy into the surrounding baths, forming a
non-equilibrium steady state. In the strong phonon-triplon coupling regime,
phonons near the two-triplon continuum hybridize strongly with triplons. Using
mean-field Lindblad dynamics, we show that this strong hybridization induces
sharp first-order phase transitions -- either single or simultaneous double --
in the emission spectrum, mainly due to dissipation-induced nonlinearities.
Using mean-field Floquet analysis of harmonic modes in both sectors, we
analytically confirm the existence of these phase transitions. Furthermore, we
map the complete steady-state phase diagram by varying key control parameters
and provide experimentally relevant parameters for observing these transitions
in laser-driven CuGeO$_3$.

Result: CeGaSi在11K发生磁相变，晶体电场分裂能量为288K，观察到负磁阻和反常霍尔效应。

Conclusion: CeGaSi是一种节点线金属，其反常霍尔效应主要由偏斜散射机制主导。

Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of CeGaSi single crystals, including
magnetic, thermodynamic, electronic, and magnetotransport properties. The
powder x-ray diffraction refinement revealed that CeGaSi crystallizes in
LaPtSi-type tetragonal structure with space group I41md. The electrical
resistivity data show a metallic nature with a sharp drop occurring around T_m
= 11 K, revealing a magnetic phase transition, which is confirmed by magnetic
susceptibility and heat capacity data. The magnetic susceptibility,
magnetization, and heat capacity data are analyzed through the crystalline
electric field based on point charge model, suggesting that the six degenerate
ground states of Ce3+ (J = 5/2) ion split into three doublets with an overall
splitting energy = 288 K. The maximum negative magnetoresistance in CeGaSi for
both B\parallel c and B\parallel ab field-direction is observed near T_m, it is
attributed to the suppression of spin-disorder scattering by the magnetic
field. The Hall resistivity data for B \parallel c and B\parallel ab show
anomalous Hall signal. Our scaling analysis suggests that anomalous Hall effect
in CeGaSi is dominated by the skew scattering mechanism. In addition,
first-principles calculations identify CeGaSi as a nodal-line metal.

Result: 计算速度比传统偶极场方法快两倍，适用于线性激发（如磁振子）。

Conclusion: PS-LL模型有望加速磁振子研究，尤其适用于需要多次模拟的逆向设计方法。

Abstract: The pseudospectral Landau-Lifshitz (PS-LL) model can describe atomic-scale
magnetic exchange interactions within a continuum framework. This is achieved
by employing a convolution kernel that models the nonlocal interaction in a
grid-independent manner. Even though the PS-LL was originally introduced to
address atomic exchange, any nonlocal kernel can be modeled. In the field of
magnonics, the dipole field is fundamental to describe the dispersion relation
of magnons, the quasiparticle representation of angular momentum. Because
dipole-dipole interactions are long-range, numerical approaches typically rely
on convolutions. Here, we demonstrate that the PS-LL model can be used to
perform magnonic simulations with a single convolution kernel derived from
analytical solutions. We demonstrate a twofold increase in computational speed
compared with the full dipole calculation. This approach is valid insofar as
the excitations are linear, which is typically the case for magnons. Our
results have the potential to accelerate magnonic research, particularly for
the inverse design method, where several simulations must be performed to
achieve the desired outcome.

Abstract: Ferromagnetic topological insulators in the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)
regime host chiral, dissipationless edge states whose propagation direction is
determined by the internal magnetization. Under suitable conditions, a strong
electrical bias can induce magnetization reversal, and thus flip the
propagation direction. In this work, we perform time-resolved measurements to
investigate the switching dynamics. Our results reveal characteristics
consistent with a disordered magnetic landscape and demonstrate that the
reversal process is thermally activated, driven by Joule heating during the
current pulse. The understanding of the magnetization dynamics in QAH systems
opens pathways for local, controlled manipulation of chiral edge states via
thermal effects.

Abstract: A radical restructuring of the optical response of highly excited
electron-hole plasma formed in a mesoscopic GaAs/AlGaAs channel in a quantizing
magnetic field when an electric current flows in the channel has been
discovered. In the absence of current, the emission spectra are caused by
transitions between Landau levels formed in the conduction band and in the
valence band of heavy holes. A critical electric current leads to a drastic
change in the emission spectra with a predominant contribution from light
holes. It is shown that the current causes local accumulation of light holes
due to Coulomb drag, which leads to strong electron-hole coupling and, as a
consequence, the formation of excitons and trions.

Abstract: The engineering of acoustic phonons in the gigahertz (GHz) range holds
significant potential for technological breakthroughs in areas such as data
processing, sensing and quantum communication. Novel approaches for
nanophononic resonators responsive to external stimuli provide additional
control and functionality for these devices. Mesoporous thin films (MTFs) for
example, featuring nanoscale ordered pores, support GHz-range acoustic
resonances. These materials are sensitive to environmental changes, such as
liquid and vapor infiltration, modifying their effective optical and elastic
properties. Here, a SiO$_{2}$ MTF-based open-cavity nanoacoustic resonator is
presented, in which the MTF forms the topmost layer and is exposed to the
environment. Using a transient reflectivity setup, acoustic responses under
varying humidity conditions are investigated. A pronounced shift in acoustic
resonance frequency with changes in relative humidity is observed for the first
time, demonstrating a simple way to tune hypersound confinement. In addition,
resonators with varying pore sizes and thicknesses are compared, revealing that
resonance frequencies are primarily influenced by material properties and film
thickness, rather than pore size. The proposed open-cavity resonator design
provides a versatile platform for future studies on the mechanical response of
MTFs to liquid and vapor infiltration, opening the gate to
environment-responsive hypersound devices.

Abstract: The dynamics of vortex states in confined geometries like thin-film disks are
characterized by a sub-GHz gyration, representing the damped oscillatory motion
of the vortex core about the disk center. It has recently been shown that
interactions between the core and azimuthal spin waves, lying in the GHz range
and driven by magnetic fields, can result in steady-state core gyration. The
gyration in turn provides a time-periodic modulation for the spin waves,
resulting in the emergence of Floquet states. Here, we present results of a
theoretical and computational study in which we examine how Floquet modes
sustain this core gyration. In particular, we find that multiple steady-state
gyration radii are possible under certain field conditions, resulting from the
nonlinear interactions between the core and Floquet modes. Different gyration
radii result in distinct Floquet frequency comb spectra and allow for
hysteretic effects, as reported in recent experiments.

Abstract: A simplified model of a metallic spin-type photonic topological insulator on

simpler and allows for easier integration into more traditional microwave
systems. The non-trivial nature of the transport is shown via direct
calculation of the structure's spin-projected Berry curvature and Wilson loop
spectra, as well as by a systematic investigation of a reduced symmetry
tight-binding model based off the Kane-Mele Hamiltonian. Device implementations
are shown for a range of non-trivial configurations.

Abstract: We present the basic elements for a modular architecture for time-bin encoded
qubits based on quantum Hall edge channels, forming the foundation of a
scalable electronic quantum information platform named TEMPO (Time-binned
Electronic Modular Platform for Qubits). Quantum states are encoded in
temporally separated edge magnetoplasmon (EMP) wave packets propagating along a
single chiral edge, eliminating the need for spatial path separation and
enhancing coherence. The platform supports full qubit
operations$\unicode{x2013}$including initialization, phase modulation, readout,
and two-qubit entangling gates$\unicode{x2013}$by leveraging dynamically
tunable quantum point contacts and electrostatic control of interferometric
loops. We consider the linear dispersion and gate-induced velocity control on
EMP propagation and describe strategies for maintaining waveform integrity.
Various single-electron sources, including ohmic injection and capacitive
excitation, are discussed in the context of coherence. Multi-qubit operations
are enabled through synchronized injection and engineered Coulomb interactions
between adjacent channels, while single-qubit readout is addressed via
spin-based or capacitive charge sensors. Our approach integrates gate-tunable
coherent control of chiral edge states, offering a comprehensive pathway toward
scalable electron quantum optics in solid-state platforms.

Conclusion: 结论是电子传输理论需考虑双电层和表面电荷分布，被动和主动传输机制均需修正和扩展。

Abstract: Theoretical foundations of electron transport in mesoscopic systems, based on
Landauer theory, Master equations or Onsager linear thermodynamics, are
revisited to show that the noniteracting electrons model is insufficient to
describe neither passive transport, nor generation of electromotive force
(active transport). It is argued that 2-body electrostatic interactions
creating double layers and surface charge distributions are crucial for the
electron transport through a junction. Phenomenological modifications of the
passive transport formulas based on the carefull analysis of the fundamental
notions of chemical, electrostatic, electrochemical, build-in potentials, band
bending and bias voltage, are proposed. On the other hand active transport can
be generated by a self-oscillating double layer (a pump ) driven by an external
heat, light or chemical energy source.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots are a promising platform for generating single and
entangled photons.Still, their use is limited even in the most advanced
structures by changes in the charge state of the quantum dot and its
environment. Here, we present detailed time-resolved resonance fluorescence
measurements on a single charge-tunable GaAs quantum dot, shedding new light on
the spectral shadows invoked by the complex impurity environment.
Detuning-dependent measurements reveal the existence of multiple Stark-shifted
resonances, which are associated with rare spectral jumps smaller than the
homogeneous linewidth and, therefore, typically concealed in the measurement
noise. We observe similar environmentally induced Stark shifts for both the
neutral exciton and negatively charged trion transitions, while the positively
and doubly negatively charged trions exhibit significant differences. Our
investigation quantifies the underlying impurity charge dynamics over a range
from well below milliseconds to seconds, revealing that the hole occupation of
the positively charged trion transition is constrained by rapid hole loss and
slow hole recapture dynamics. Utilizing a second non-resonant laser, we
increase the hole occupancy by over an order of magnitude and identify both a
prolonged hole residence time and an enhanced hole tunneling rate into the
quantum dot. These findings are supported by complementary spin noise
spectroscopy measurements, which offer a significantly higher bandwidth
compared to the time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements.

Method: 采用双门控模型，独立控制载流子密度和层间电位差，计算不同角度和能量下的电子传输和反射概率。

Result: 中等偏压通过打开低能谱带隙抑制了垂直入射传输，导致低能下近乎全反射，并在带隙上方出现传输增加。偏压还导致方向依赖和谷特异性不对称性。

Conclusion: 垂直层间偏压可有效调控扭曲双层石墨烯中的电子隧穿行为，为未来电子器件设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG), chiral tunneling can be tuned by
parameters such as the twist angle, barrier height, and Fermi energy. This
differs from the tunneling behavior observed in monolayer and Bernal bilayer
graphene, where electrons either pass completely through or are fully blocked
due to the Klein paradox. Here we investigate the effect of a perpendicular
interlayer bias on electron tunneling through electrostatic barriers in TBLG.
Using a dual-gated model, which controls the carrier density and interlayer
potential difference independently, we compute the transmission and reflection
probabilities of electrons at different angles and energies for representative
twist angles of $\theta = 1.8^{\circ}$, $3.89^{\circ}$, and $9.43^{\circ}$. We
find that a moderate bias suppresses normal-incidence transmission by opening a
band gap in the low-energy spectrum. Our results show this leads to near-total
reflection at low energy, with transmission starting to increase just above the
gap due to twist-dependent conducting channels. The applied bias breaks the
system's effective inversion symmetry, resulting in pronounced
direction-dependent and valley-specific asymmetries in the angular distribution
of transmitted electrons. We show that electrons incident at different angles
show notable variations in transmission under bias. Furthermore, interlayer
bias modulates Fabry--P\'{e}rot--like resonances in the TBLG barrier, shifting
the energies of transmission peaks and altering their intensity.

Abstract: We propose using Andreev bound states (ABS) as spectroscopic probes to
characterize Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev
chains. Specifically, we show that tunneling conductance measurements with a
superconducting probe hosting an ABS reveal four subgap peaks whose voltage
positions and relative heights enable extraction of the MZM energy splitting
and Bogoliubov-de Gennes coherence factors. This provides direct access to
zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of
the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental
architectures and remains robust in extended chains.

Abstract: Exciton polaritons based on atomically thin semiconductors are essential
building blocks of quantum optoelectronic devices. Their properties are
governed by an ultrafast and oscillatory energy transfer between their
excitonic and photonic constituents, resulting in the formation of polaritonic
quasiparticles with pronounced nonlinearities induced by the excitonic
component. In metallic nanoresonators, dissipation phenomena limit the
polariton lifetime to a few ten femtoseconds, so short that the role of these
polaritons for the nonlinearities of such hybrids is yet unexplored. Here, we
use ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to uncover
coherent polariton dynamics in a hybrid monolayer (1L) WS2/plasmonic
nanostructure. With respect to an uncoupled WS2 flake, we observe an over
20-fold, polarization-dependent enhancement of the optical nonlinearity and a
rapid evolution of the 2DES spectra within ~70 fs. We relate these dynamics to
a transition from coherent polaritons to incoherent excitations, unravel the
microscopic optical nonlinearities, and show the potential of coherent
polaritons for ultrafast all-optical switching.

Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene hosts a rich landscape of correlated
symmetry-broken phases, driven by strong interactions from its flat band edges.
Aligning to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) creates a moir\'e pattern, leading to
recent observations of exotic ground states such as integer and fractional
quantum anomalous Hall effects. Here, we show that the moir\'e effects and
resulting correlated phase diagrams are critically influenced by a previously
underestimated structural choice: the hBN alignment orientation. This binary
parameter distinguishes between configurations where the rhombohedral graphene
and hBN lattices are aligned near 0{\deg} or 180{\deg}, a distinction that
arises only because both materials break inversion symmetry. Although the two
orientations produce the same moir\'e wavelength, we find their distinct local
stacking configurations result in markedly different moir\'e potential
strengths. Using low-temperature transport and scanning SQUID-on-tip
magnetometry, we compare nearly identical devices that differ only in alignment
orientation and observe sharply contrasting sequences of symmetry-broken
states. Theoretical analysis reveals a simple mechanism based on lattice
relaxation and the atomic-scale electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene,
supported by detailed modeling. These findings establish hBN alignment
orientation as a key control parameter in moir\'e-engineered graphene systems
and provide a framework for interpreting both prior and future experiments.

Abstract: We present a transparent and analytically tractable approach to the problem
of time-dependent electron transport through tunneling barriers. Using the
Single-Electron Approach, we study a model system composed of a time-dependent
tunneling barrier coupled to two reservoirs of finite bandwidth. Avoiding
Floquet expansions, we derive simple expressions for the time-dependent
tunneling current in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes. Our formulation,
based on the tunneling Hamiltonian framework, relates barrier modulation to
measurable phase shifts in the steady-state current, offering a physically
intuitive definition of the tunneling (or traversal) time. Remarkably, in the
Markovian limit (wide-band reservoirs), we recover the well-known result of
vanishing tunneling time. In contrast, for finite-bandwidth leads, we predict a
finite time delay given by the inverse bandwidth. Our findings provide a robust
foundation for understanding tunneling dynamics in non-Markovian environments
and may serve as a benchmark for experimental investigations involving tunable
band structures.

Motivation: 验证投影方法在MATBG中的适用性，并开发新的序参量以可视化波函数和量化对称性破缺。

Method: 使用投影方法对MATBG的平带进行建模，并与全紧束缚模型比较；引入新的序参量分析波函数和对称性破缺。

Result: 平带投影解与全紧束缚模型吻合良好，能带结构和总能差异仅为几meV；新序参量有效表征了MATBG及相关系统的对称性破缺。

Conclusion: 投影方法在MATBG中有效，新序参量为研究其及相关系统的对称性破缺提供了有力工具。

Abstract: We benchmark the recently proposed projection method [Phys. Rev. B 111,
205133 (2025)] for magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) across various
symmetry-breaking phases at charge neutrality. The flat-band projected
solutions agree well with the full tight-binding, with band structures and
total energies differing by only a few meV. The projection to the flat bands is
justified, owing to the increased gap to the remote bands in the normal state.
Moreover, we employ a novel set of order parameters that allow us to visualize
the wave functions locally in real space and quantify the breaking of various
symmetries in the correlated phases. These order parameters are suitable to
characterize MATBG and generic honeycomb systems.

Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), particularly at half-filling of
Landau levels, provides a unique window into topological phases hosting
non-Abelian excitations. However, experimental platforms simultaneously
offering large energy gaps, delicate tunability, and robust non-Abelian
signatures remain scarce. Here, we report the observation of a cascade of
even-denominator FQH states at filling factors ${\nu}$ = ${-5/2}$, ${-7/2}$,
${-9/2}$, ${-11/2}$, and ${-13/2}$, alongside numerous odd-denominator states
in mixed-stacked pentalayer graphene, a previously unexplored system
characterized by intertwined quadratic and cubic band dispersions. These
even-denominator states, representing the highest filling half-filled states
reported so far in the zeroth Landau level (ZLL), emerge from two distinct
intra-ZLL and exhibit unprecedented displacement field tunability driven by LL
crossings in the hybridized multiband structure. At half fillings, continuous
quasiparticle phase transitions between paired FQH states, magnetic Bloch
states, and composite Fermi liquids are clearly identified upon tuning external
fields. Numerical calculations, revealing characteristic sixfold ground-state
degeneracy and chiral graviton spectral analysis, suggest the observed
even-denominator FQH states belong to the non-Abelian Moore-Read type. These
results establish mixed-stacked multilayer graphene as a rich and versatile
crystalline platform for exploring tunable correlated topological phases.

Result: 推导了Majorana极化的解析表达式，并通过数值计算验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估短Kitaev链中Majorana态的质量提供了定量手段。

Abstract: The coherence factors of quasiparticles in a superconductor determine their
properties, including transport and susceptibility to electric fields. In this
work, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local
transport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current
through a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the
current is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors,
becoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of
local electron-hole symmetry, {\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply
our method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow
superconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles
(zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We
demonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana
polarization (MP) -- a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the
state. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents
and benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that
include a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results
provide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short
Kitaev chains.

TL;DR: 研究了具有随机层间隧穿的多层拓扑绝缘体，发现非厄米缺陷能分裂能级但保持能级交叉规则，可作为拓扑的局部标记。不同无序类型对边缘模的局域化长度有不同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多层拓扑绝缘体中无序隧穿对能态和边缘模的影响，以理解拓扑相变和实验偏差。

Method: 采用Burkov-Balents模型和两种互补的图示方法分析能态密度，研究无序对能隙和边缘模的影响。

Result: 无序隧穿在平凡相中使束缚态能级交叉零点，而在拓扑相中不交叉。Weyl相在强无序下保持稳定，而反常量子霍尔相仅对弱无序稳定。边缘模的局域化长度受无序类型影响。

Conclusion: 无序隧穿对拓扑绝缘体的能态和边缘模有显著影响，可作为拓扑相变的局部标记，并解释了实验中的偏差。

Abstract: We study multilayer topological insulators with random interlayer tunnelling,
known as off-diagonal disorder. Within the Burkov-Balents model a single
Hermitian defect creates a bound state whose energy crosses the middle of the
gap in the trivial phase but never in the topological phase; a non-Hermitian
defect splits this level yet preserves the same crossing rule, so the effect
serves as a local marker of topology. However, the key distinction persists:
the bound state crosses zero in the trivial phase but not in the topological
phase. Two complementary diagrammatic approaches give matching densities of
states for the normal, topological, Weyl and anomalous quantum Hall regimes.
Off diagonal disorder inserts bulk states into the gap and can close it: the
Weyl phase remains robust under strong disorder, whereas the anomalous quantum
Hall phase survives only for weak fluctuations, and the added bulk states
shrink the Hall plateau, clarifying experimental deviations. Finally, we
analyse edge modes. Uniform disorder shortens their localization length
slightly, while Gaussian and Lorentzian disorder enlarge it and in the Gaussian
case can even delocalize the edges. Although chirality is maintained, the
enhanced overlap permits tunnelling between opposite edges and pulls the
longitudinal conductance away from its quantized value.

Result: 手性离子门控能够以手性依赖的方式调控磁畴比例，实现手性诱导的对称性破缺。

Conclusion: 手性离子门控为控制磁序提供了新策略，并为手性自旋电子学开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Chiral molecular systems offer unique pathways to control spin and magnetism
beyond conventional symmetry operations. Here, we demonstrate that chiral ionic
liquids enable electric-field modulation of two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism
in FeSi(111) thin films via electric double-layer transistor (EDLT) gating.
FeSi hosts chemically-stable, surface-confined ferromagnetism without bulk
moments, making the interfacial spins highly responsive to chiral-ion
adsorption. Using both achiral and chiral ionic liquids, we systematically
compare electrochemical and electrostatic gating effects. While both gating
modes modulate magnetic properties such as anomalous Hall conductivity and
coercive field, only chiral ionic gating biases the ratio of up- and
down-magnetized domains in a handedness-dependent manner, evidencing
chirality-induced symmetry breaking. This work establishes chiral ion gating as
a novel strategy for controlling magnetic order and opens new directions for
chiral spintronics.

Result: 薄膜通过改变电磁模式色散和耦合强度，实现热传递的增强和聚焦。

Conclusion: 为纳米尺度局部辐射热传递的主动控制提供了可行途径。

Abstract: The spatially resolved near-field radiative heat transfer between a nanoscale
probe and a substrate is studied in the fluctuational electrodynamics framework
within the dipolar approximation. It is shown that the introduction of a thin
polar film atop a non-dispersive substrate can lead to both an enhancement and
a lateral focusing of the heat exchange. The influence of the probe--substrate
separation, film thickness and substrate permittivity is analyzed, revealing
that the effect originates from near-field interactions governed by the
interplay between film-induced modifications of electromagnetic mode dispersion
and the distance-dependent coupling strength. The results highlight a viable
route toward the active control of local radiative heat transfer at the
nanoscale.

Conclusion: 退相干通过加热低能激发影响Kondo物理，电荷与自旋退相干对Kondo稳态的影响不同。

Abstract: We study the interplay between strong correlations and Markovian dephasing,
resulting from monitoring the charge or spin degrees of freedom of a quantum
dot described by a dissipative Anderson impurity model. Using the Auxiliary
master equation approach we compute the steady-state spectral function and
occupation of the dot and discuss the role of dephasing on Kondo physics.
Furthermore, we consider a two-lead setup which allows to compute the
steady-state current and conductance. We show that the Kondo steady-state is
robust to moderate charge dephasing but not to spin dephasing, which we
interpret in terms of dephasing-induced heating of low-energy excitations.
Finally, we show universal scaling collapse of the non-linear conductance with
a dephasing-dependent Kondo scale.

Motivation: 探索临界NHSE在非厄米系统中的独特性质，特别是格林函数的行为，以理解GBZ理论的适用范围。

Method: 使用双链Hatano-Nelson模型，分析不同耦合强度Δ下的格林函数行为，包括常规区域和异常区域。

Result: 小Δ时，常规区域的格林函数呈现锯齿状结构；异常区域中，格林函数在体区符合GBZ理论，但在边界附近发散。

Conclusion: 临界NHSE表现出非微扰特性，需同时考虑体区和边界动力学，GBZ理论在有限尺寸和边界效应中存在局限性。

Abstract: We study the Green's functions in non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the
critical non-Hermitian skin effect (critical NHSE) using a double-chain
Hatano-Nelson model with inter-chain coupling $\Delta$. For $\Delta=0$, the
system decouples into two independent chains, and the Green's functions follow
predictable patterns based on the GBZ theory. For small $\Delta$
($\Delta=1/10000$), in conventional regions with trivial OBC spectral winding
numbers, inter-chain coupling induces a zigzag scaling structure in Green's
functions due to competition between the two chains, explainable by first-order
perturbation theory. In anomalous regions with non-trivial winding numbers,
Green's functions match GBZ predictions in the bulk but diverge near
boundaries, with residual contributions from the $\Delta=0$ GBZ accounting for
the deviations. These results reveal the unique non-perturbative features of
critical NHSE and highlight the limitations of GBZ theory in capturing
finite-size and boundary effects, emphasizing the need to consider both bulk
and boundary dynamics in such systems.
