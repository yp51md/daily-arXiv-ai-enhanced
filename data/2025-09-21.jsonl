Strikingly, further increase in the driving period\nresults in a series of localization-delocalization transitions leaving behind\ntraces of extended regimes (islands) in between MBL phases. Furthermore,\nnon-Hermiticity renders the extended islands boundary-sensitive, resulting in a\nFloquet many-body skin effect under open boundaries.

However,\nrecent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled\nstates can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and\nmulti-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized\nmeasurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that\nvolume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet\nnon-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model\ncomprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where\ngeneralized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to\ndetector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law\nentanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the\nmain chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find\nthat such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the\nmeasurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of\nnon-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement\ngeneration by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the\nstatistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the\napproach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady\nstates, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the\nmeasurement-only dynamics.

In this work, we explore a generalized\nmeasurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that\nvolume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet\nnon-commuting measurements.

As standard FKPP equation the\nstudied system of equations has one unstable and one stable homogeneous\nsolution with travelling wave switching between them.

Applying a tilted magnetic\nfield induces spin-charge hybridization which enables spin-photon coupling. For\nlow disorder, the photons couple states of simultaneously (almost) opposite\nspin and angular momentum.

In this work, we explore a generalized\nmeasurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that\nvolume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet\nnon-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model\ncomprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where\ngeneralized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to\ndetector qubits.

The recently\nintroduced single-boson exchange decomposition of the vertex presents an\nalternative set of equivalent equations in terms of screened interactions,\nHedin vertices, and rest functions. This formulation has garnered much\nattention for several reasons: opening the door to new approximations, for\navoiding vertex divergences associated with local moment formation plaguing the\ntraditional parquet decomposition, and for its interpretative advantage in its\nbuilt-in diagrammatic identification of bosons without resorting to\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformations. In this work, we show how the fermionic\ndiagrams of the particle-particle and particle-hole polarizations can be mapped\nto diagrammatics of a bosonic self-energy of two respective bosonic theories\nwith pure bosonic constituents, solidifying the identification of the screened\ninteraction with a bosonic propagator. Resorting to a spin-diagonalized basis\nfor the bosonic fields and neglecting the coupling between singlet and triplet\ncomponents is shown to recover the trace log theory known from\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformations. Armed with this concrete mapping, we\nrevisit a conjecture claiming that universal aspects of the parquet\napproximation coincide with those of the self-consistent screening\napproximation for a bosonic $O(N)$ model.

In this paper, we refer to this interpretive stance as\nthe nonfactorizable position. In contrast, superdeterminism represents the view\nthat measurement independence does not hold.

This\npaper offers a philosophical reassessment of measurement independence through\nthree major frameworks in the philosophy of science: de Regt's contextual\ntheory of scientific understanding, Kuhn's criteria for theory choice, and\nLakatos's methodology of scientific research programmes.

Combined with an improved\nupper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined\ncontinuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new\nstate-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing\nchannel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the\npreviously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian\noptimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish\nlower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum\ninstruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by\nparameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical\nresults for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our\nmethods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results.\nTogether, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and\npowerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication\nlimits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel\ncoherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity\nlower bounds in general."}

The key novelty of our algorithm is an offline classical\nsampling protocol that gives information about the spectrum of the problem\nHamiltonian.

We empirically demonstrate\nthat SamBa-GQW finds high quality approximate solutions on problems up to a\nsize of $n=20$ qubits by only sampling $n^2$ states among $2^n$ possible\ndecisions.

Two issues\nunderlie this bottleneck: (i) the no-cloning theorem imposes a linear growth in\ncircuit evaluations with the number of parameters per gradient step; and (ii)\ndeeper circuits encounter barren plateaus (BPs), leading to exponentially\nincreasing measurement overheads. To address these challenges, here we propose\na deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive\nparameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of\nHamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy.\nThe motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of\nparameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics. Its\ndesign combines a theoretically grounded data construction strategy, ensuring\neach training example is informative and BP-resilient, with an adaptive neural\narchitecture that generalizes across ansatze of varying sizes. Across benchmark\ntransverse-field Ising models, Heisenberg models, and multiple molecule systems\nup to 30 qubits, Titan achieves up to 3 times faster convergence and 40% to 60%\nfewer circuit evaluations than state-of-the-art baselines, while matching or\nsurpassing their estimation accuracy. By proactively trimming parameter space,\nTitan lowers hardware demands and offers a scalable path toward utilizing VQE\nto advance practical quantum chemistry and materials science."}
