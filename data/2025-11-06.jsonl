While the quantum impurity\nproblem has been extensively studied with ultracold atomic gases, repulsive\npolarons in the strongly correlated regime have remained elusive. Typically,\nthe impurity atoms bind into molecules or rapidly decay into deeper lying\nstates before they can acquire an appreciable dressing cloud. Here, we report\non the realization of polarons in a strongly repulsive quasi-two-dimensional\nquantum gas. Using a superfluid of $^6$Li dimers, we introduce impurities by\npromoting a small fraction of the dimers into higher levels of the transverse\nconfining potential. These novel synthetic-spin polarons give access to the\nstrongly repulsive regime where common decay channels are suppressed. We\nextract key polaron properties - the energy, quasiparticle residue, and\neffective mass - using trap modulation and Bragg spectroscopy. Our measurements\nare well captured by a microscopic T-matrix approach and quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations, revealing deviations from mean-field predictions. In particular,\nwe measure a significant enhancement of the polaron mass, with values exceeding\ntwice the free dimer mass. Our demonstration of a stable repulsive Bose polaron\nestablishes a platform for studying impurity physics in low-dimensional and\nstrongly correlated systems."}

Next, we\nanalyze the dynamics of this system in the presence of a static external force\nand demonstrate that non-Hermiticity leads to asymmetric two-particle Bloch\noscillations. Interestingly, when $F=0$ ($F \\ne 0$), strong interactions leads\nto the formation of an inner density-cone (density-hourglass) structure; this\ninner structure also becomes asymmetric in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We\nfurther analyze the spatial correlations and establish that the system exhibits\nnon-reciprocal bunching (anti-bunching) in the presence of weak (strong)\ninteractions.

This work investigates dynamical discontinuities that arise\nwhen the post-selected polar angle is used as a control parameter. The system\nevolves under repeated applications of a weak measurement protocol with\npost-selection, in which the meter state is retained after each iteration while\nthe system is renewed. The emergence of these discontinuities is shown to be\ndetermined by the structure of the weak value: when the weak value has a\nnonzero imaginary component, a discontinuity appears in the expectation value\nof meter observables precisely at the point where the imaginary part of the\nweak value vanishes as a function of the post-selection polar angle. In\ncontrast, no discontinuities occur when the weak value remains real for all\npost-selection angles. The phenomenon originates from the eigenstructure of the\nprotocol's Kraus operator, with the stability of fixed points changing at the\ncritical point where the discontinuity arises. Remarkably, the associated\ncritical exponent is 1, independent of system parameters. These results open\nnew perspectives for engineering non-analytic behavior in measurement-based\nquantum control and for probing criticality in post-selected quantum dynamics\nusing weak measurements with weak values."}

Within the resulting class of first order local\nHamiltonian field theories, these axioms single out the canonical Poisson\nbracket on density and phase under the Dubrovin and Novikov assumptions for\nlocal hydrodynamic brackets. Using a pointwise, gauge covariant complex change\nof variables that maps density and phase to a single complex field, we show\nthat the only convex, rotationally invariant, first derivative local functional\nof the density whose Euler Lagrange term yields a reversible completion that is\nexactly projectively linear is the Fisher functional.

Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the\nstability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only\none solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable.\nFurthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity,\nidentifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical\nanalysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability\nto bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes\nan analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly\nrelevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and\noptical propagation in engineered photonic lattices."}

We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer\nmatrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact\neigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical\ntransverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection\nbetween the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical\nIsing chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics."}

A continuous\nsimilarity transformation is applied in momentum space to derive an effective\nHamiltonian that conserves the number of magnon excitations. This allows us to\nquantitatively calculate the one-magnon dispersion, the effects of\nmagnon-magnon interactions, and the dynamic structure factor in a certain range\nof parameters. In particular, we focus on the altermagnetic spin splitting of\nthe magnon bands and the size of the roton minimum. We further map out\ndivergencies of the continuous similarity transformation for different types of\ngenerators, which signal either the breakdown of the N\\'eel-ordered phase or\nthe presence of significant magnon decay."}
