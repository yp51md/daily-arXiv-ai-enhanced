Abstract: We investigate quantum quenches starting from a critical point and
experimentally probe the associated defect statistics using a trapped-ion
quantum simulator of the transverse-field Ising model. The cumulants of the
defect number distribution exhibit universal scaling with quench depth,
featuring Gaussian behavior at leading order and systematic subleading
corrections. Our results are in excellent agreement with both exact and
approximate theoretical predictions, establishing quench-depth scaling as a
powerful and precise experimental benchmark for nonequilibrium quantum critical
dynamics.

Abstract: A recent work (Li, 2406.01204) considered quantum simulation of Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED) on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of
freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider
representing the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and
develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the Coulomb
gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting
on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The
Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge
fields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The
local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are
swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the
qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time
simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and
Hamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the
continuum limit or the UV completion of QED.

Conclusion: araQne编译器在优化分布式量子计算中具有重要作用，通过减少通信需求提升了效率。

Abstract: Just as classical computing relies on distributed systems, the quantum
computing era requires new kinds of infrastructure and software tools. Quantum
networks will become the backbone of hybrid, quantum-augmented data centers, in
which quantum algorithms are distributed over a local network of quantum
processing units (QPUs) interconnected via shared entanglement. In this
context, it is crucial to develop methods and software that minimize the number
of inter-QPU communications. Here we describe key features of the quantum
compiler araQne, which is designed to minimize distribution cost, measured by
the number of entangled pairs required to distribute a monolithic quantum
circuit using gate teleportation protocols. We establish the crucial role
played by circuit reordering strategies, which strongly reduce the distribution
cost compared to a baseline approach.

### [4] [Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates and Less Overhead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01229)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的基于腔辅助光子散射（CAPS）的量子互联协议，通过优化协议和深入分析原子-腔动力学，实现了高保真度和高速率的量子网络连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAPS协议的保真度和速率受限，限制了其在量子互联中的应用。本文旨在消除这些限制，展示CAPS作为量子网络协议的潜力。

Method: 通过改进协议和分析原子-腔动力学，结合时间复用操作和混合网络配置，提升CAPS的性能。

Result: 实验证明，使用现有或近期的光学腔质量，可实现0.999的保真度和高速率纠缠生成。例如，200个Yb原子与腔耦合时，纠缠生成速率可达4×10^5 s^-1。

Conclusion: 改进后的CAPS协议成为扩展量子信息平台的领先候选方案，兼具高性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block
of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS)
approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based
on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success
probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining
a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or
intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a
primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity
and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing
protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations
by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity
dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities
are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses
required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed
operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate
entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration
leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for
external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a
concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal
cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times
10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup
beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength
channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading
candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.

Result: 协议成功保护了参与者的身份和参数值，同时避免了现有协议可能存在的漏洞。

Conclusion: 该协议为分布式参数估计提供了一种安全且高效的方法，适用于量子网络中的多种应用。

Abstract: Anonymity and privacy are two key functionalities in modern communication
networks. In quantum networks, distributed quantum sensing has emerged as a
powerful use case, with applications to clock synchronisation, detecting
gravitational effects and more. In this work, we develop a new protocol
combining the different cryptographic functionalities of anonymity and privacy
for the task of distributed parameter estimation. That is, we present a
protocol that allows a selected subset of network participants to anonymously
collaborate in estimating the average of their private parameters. Crucially,
this is achieved without disclosing either the individual parameter values or
the identities of the participants, neither to each other nor to the broader
network. Our approach builds on a modified scheme that preserves the distinct
security guarantees of existing protocols, while avoiding potential
vulnerabilities that could arise from applying those protocols sequentially.

Abstract: Stochastic unravelings are a widely used tool to solve open quantum system
dynamics, in which the exact solution is obtained via an average over a
stochastic process on the set of pure quantum states. Recently, the generalized
rate operator unraveling formalism was derived, allowing not only for an
engineering of the stochastic realizations, but also to unravel without reverse
jumps even for some dynamics in which P-divisibility is violated, thus hugely
improving the simulation efficiency. This is possible because the unraveling
depend on an arbitrary non-linear transformation which can incorporate the
memory effects. In this work, a stochastic Schr\"odinger equation for this
formalism is derived, both for cases with and without reverse jumps. It is also
shown that a failure of this method can be used to witness master equations
leading unphysical time evolutions, independently on the particular non-linear
transformation considered.

Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish exact relations for nonequilibrium dynamics,
profoundly advancing the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we
extend quantum fluctuation theorems beyond the traditional thermodynamic
framework to quantum information dynamics and many-body systems, where both the
system and the environment are multipartite without assuming any thermodynamic
constraints. Based on the two-point measurement scheme and the classical
probability, we establish the fluctuation theorem for the dynamics of many-body
classical mutual information. By extending to quasiprobability, we derive
quantum fluctuation theorems for many-body coherence and quantum correlations,
presenting them in both integral and detailed forms. Our theoretical results
are illustrated and verified using three-qubit examples, and feasible
experimental verification protocols are proposed. These findings uncover the
statistical structure underlying the nonequilibrium quantum information
dynamics, providing fundamental insights and new tools for advancing quantum
technologies.

Result: 实验验证了不等式违反，首次实现了无需辅助纠缠源、适用于所有纠缠态的认证方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子关联的认证提供了新工具，填补了现有技术的不足。

Abstract: By combining the assumption of Bell locality with that of generalized
noncontextuality, we define different classes of noncontextuality inequalities
for correlations in a bipartite Bell scenario, with the classes being
distinguished by which set of operational identities are taken into account,
with certain natural subsets defining a hierarchy of classes. We prove that
violations of the inequalities at different levels of the hierarchy can witness
that a bipartite state is entangled, steerable, or nonlocal, respectively,
thereby providing a means of certifying these different forms of quantum
correlations. To illustrate the power of this approach, we demonstrate the
violation of one such inequality in an experiment with polarization-entangled
photons. This allows us to certify entanglement in certain qubit isotropic
states for which certification by Bell or steering inequalities is known to be
impossible. Our entanglement certification scheme is the first to combine all
of the following desirable features: it requires no prior characterization of
the measurements, it delivers a verdict based on quantities that are
independent of the tomographic gauge freedom, it is able to certify any
entangled state, and it requires no auxiliary entangled sources.

Conclusion: 该研究为混合CV-DV架构的可扩展、容错量子计算奠定了基础，适用于逻辑门合成、读出和混合算法设计。

Abstract: This thesis develops a theoretical framework for hybrid continuous-variable
(CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum systems, with emphasis on quantum
control, state preparation, and error correction. A central contribution is
non-abelian quantum signal processing (NA-QSP), a generalization of quantum
signal processing to settings where control parameters are non-commuting
operators. Within this framework, we introduce the Gaussian-Controlled-Rotation
(GCR) protocol, which enables high-fidelity control of CV states using DV
ancillae. This approach allows for deterministic preparation of squeezed, cat,
and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states without numerical optimization.
  Two previously unpublished contributions are included: (i) Chapter 2.3
introduces the Gaussian hierarchy, a classification of CV operations analogous
to the Clifford hierarchy, offering a new lens for understanding CV gate sets;
(ii) Chapter 5 presents an analytical framework for correcting photon loss in
finite-energy GKP codes, introducing the notion of probabilistic error
correction, providing insight into recent GKP experiments surpassing break-even
thresholds.
  Overall, this work lays the groundwork for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum
computation in hybrid CV-DV architectures, with applications to logical gate
synthesis, readout, and hybrid algorithm design using ancilla oscillators.

Abstract: Noise from material defects at device interfaces is known to limit the
coherence of superconducting circuits, yet our understanding of the defect
origins and noise mechanisms remains incomplete. Here we investigate the
temperature and in-plane magnetic-field dependence of energy relaxation in a
low-frequency fluxonium qubit, where the sensitivity to flux noise and charge
noise arising from dielectric loss can be tuned by applied flux. We observe an
approximately linear scaling of flux noise with temperature $T$ and a power-law
dependence of dielectric loss $T^3$ up to 100 mK. Additionally, we find that
the dielectric-loss-limited $T_1$ decreases with weak in-plane magnetic fields,
suggesting a potential magnetic-field response of the underlying charge-coupled
defects. We implement a multi-level decoherence model in our analysis,
motivated by the widely tunable matrix elements and transition energies
approaching the thermal energy scale in our system. These findings offer
insight for fluxonium coherence modeling and should inform microscopic theories
of intrinsic noise in superconducting circuits.

Result: 噪声自适应转译导致工作负载集中在少数量子比特上，随机映射可缓解此问题；单次编译的电路可重复使用。

Conclusion: 建议减少噪声自适应转译的频率，采用轻量化方案以提高效率。

Abstract: Transpilation, particularly noise-aware optimization, is widely regarded as
essential for maximizing the performance of quantum circuits on superconducting
quantum computers. The common wisdom is that each circuit should be transpiled
using up-to-date noise calibration data to optimize fidelity. In this work, we
revisit the necessity of frequent noise-adaptive transpilation, conducting an
in-depth empirical study across five IBM 127-qubit quantum computers and 16
diverse quantum algorithms. Our findings reveal novel and interesting insights:
(1) noise-aware transpilation leads to a heavy concentration of workloads on a
small subset of qubits, which increases output error variability; (2) using
random mapping can mitigate this effect while maintaining comparable average
fidelity; and (3) circuits compiled once with calibration data can be reliably
reused across multiple calibration cycles and time periods without significant
loss in fidelity. These results suggest that the classical overhead associated
with daily, per-circuit noise-aware transpilation may not be justified. We
propose lightweight alternatives that reduce this overhead without sacrificing
fidelity -- offering a path to more efficient and scalable quantum workflows.

Conclusion: 这种灵活混合算法可作为NISQ设备与未来容错量子计算机之间的桥梁，推动量子化学优势的早期实现。

Abstract: The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces
significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets
and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach
to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of
logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by
existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of
accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where
classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized
by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In
this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach:
coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in
reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state
energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive
analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies
when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by
today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where
problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a
bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future
fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization
of quantum advantage in chemistry.

Method: 通过测量新创建和自然界中稳定同位素的超精细分裂，分析锶-87、镥-175和镥-176的核磁矩变化。

Result: 提出核磁矩可能随时间变化，可用于预测同位素的年龄和衰变时间。

Conclusion: 原子跃迁可能随时间变化，可通过双原子钟实验进一步验证电子跃迁的老化现象。

Abstract: We propose and analyze experiments to test determinism and the role of time
in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if stable isotopes
change over time. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for newly
created stable isotopes and compare them to the same isotopes found in nature.
The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons,
lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number
of protons and neutrons. These experiments would search for possible changes in
the nuclear magnetic moment of isotopes since they were first created during
nucleosynthesis. We propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may
enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction
of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of
thulium-170 is analyzed, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with
an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic
transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the
electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock
in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.

Result: 实验显示72小时内干涉可见度保持在95.3%，标准差0.47%。

Conclusion: 该装置适用于多用户场景，且能长期稳定运行。

Abstract: Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution requires first-order interference between
coherent states sent by Alice and Bob in a mid-station Charlie. In order to
obtain stable operation and maximum interferometric visibility, not only phase
stabilization but also polarization control is required, especially in
optical-fiber setups. In this paper, we propose an experimental setup that
simultaneously provides passive stabilization of phase and polarization
fluctuations by combining a Sagnac-like interferometer with a "Plug-and-Play"
configuration employing Faraday mirrors. Experimental results show a net
interferometric visibility maintained around 95.3% during 72 hours of
continuous operation, with a standard deviation of 0.47%. The setup can be
straightforwardly adapted to a multi-user scenario employing either a star
network, a bus topology, or a combination of both.

Conclusion: 该性能极限为硬件平台的容错能力提供了设备无关的度量标准，并为鲁棒控制合成和系统识别设定了定量目标。

Abstract: We derive a universal performance limit for coherent quantum control in the
presence of modeled and unmodeled uncertainties. For any target unitary $W$
that is implementable in the absence of error, we prove that the worst-case
(and hence the average) gate fidelity obeys the lower bound $F \ge
\Flb\bigl(\tf \Omeff\bigr)$, where $\tf$ is the gate duration and $\Omeff$ is a
single frequency-like measure that aggregates \emph{all} bounded uncertainty
sources, e.g., coherent control imperfections, unknown couplings, and residual
environment interactions, without assuming an initially factorizable
system-bath state or a completely positive map. The bound is obtained by
combining an interaction-picture averaging method with a Bellman-Gronwall
inequality and holds for any finite-norm Hamiltonian decomposition. Hence it
applies equally to qubits, multi-level qudits, and ancilla-assisted operations.
Because $\Flb$ depends only on the dimensionless product $\tf\Omeff$, it yields
a device-independent metric that certifies whether a given hardware platform
can, in principle, reach a specified fault-tolerance threshold, and also sets a
quantitative target for robust-control synthesis and system identification.

Abstract: Reconstructing quantum states from measurement data represents a formidable
challenge in quantum information science, especially as system sizes grow
beyond the reach of traditional tomography methods. While recent studies have
explored quantum machine learning (QML) for quantum state tomography (QST),
nearly all rely on idealized assumptions, such as direct access to the unknown
quantum state as quantum data input, which are incompatible with current
hardware constraints. In this work, we present a QML-based tomography protocol
that operates entirely on classical measurement data and is fully executable on
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our approach employs a
variational quantum circuit trained to reconstruct quantum states based solely
on measurement outcomes. We test the method in simulation, achieving
high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse quantum states, including GHZ states,
spin chain ground states, and states generated by random circuits. The protocol
is then validated on quantum hardware from IBM and IonQ. Additionally, we
demonstrate accurate tomography is possible using incomplete measurement bases,
a crucial step towards scaling up our protocol. Our results in various
scenarios illustrate successful state reconstruction with fidelity reaching 90%
or higher. To our knowledge, this is the first QML-based tomography scheme that
uses exclusively classical measurement data and has been implemented on real
quantum processors. This work establishes the feasibility of QML-based
tomography on current quantum platforms and offers a scalable pathway for
practical quantum state reconstruction.

### [17] [Hardness of Quantum Distribution Learning and Quantum Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01292)
*Taiga Hiroka,Min-Hsiu Hsieh,Tomoyuki Morimae*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了量子密码学中的单向谜题（OWPuzzs）与分布学习难度的关系，首次建立了OWPuzzs与量子分布学习难度的完整联系，并探讨了PP≠BQP与学习难度的等价性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在经典密码学中，单向函数（OWFs）的存在性是最小假设，但在量子密码学中情况不同。OWPuzzs作为量子类比，其存在性与PP≠BQP相关，但缺乏类似经典密码学中OWFs与P≠NP关系的完整刻画。

Method: 通过研究量子分布学习的难度，建立了OWPuzzs与平均情况下量子分布学习难度的等价性，并探讨了PP≠BQP与最坏情况下学习难度的关系。

Result: 证明了OWPuzzs的存在性等价于平均情况下量子分布学习的难度；同时，PP≠BQP等价于另一种标准学习难度（不可知学习）。

Conclusion: 论文首次完整刻画了OWPuzzs与量子分布学习难度的关系，为量子密码学的基础假设提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: The existence of one-way functions (OWFs) forms the minimal assumption in
classical cryptography. However, this is not necessarily the case in quantum
cryptography. One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer,
provide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies
$PP\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the
analogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \neq NP$-has long
been studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning
in various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to
$P \neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for
OWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of
OWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution
learning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper
quantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that
follows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution
learning can be derived from $PP \neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to
average-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from
$PP \neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if
worst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \neq
SampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite
that, we show that $PP \neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of
hardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \neq BQP$ if and only if
agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard.
As a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning
with respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\Sigma_3^P}$ learners
implies $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$.

Motivation: 探索在室温条件下利用氮空位中心和微波腔实现超辐射回波的可能性，为量子传感应用提供新途径。

Method: 结合激光照射和微波Hahn回波序列，通过微波驱动脉冲和自由演化在频率空间中形成相位光栅，并通过集体耦合产生多次超辐射回波。

Result: 超辐射回波可通过微波脉冲和激光照射主动调控，且其动力学行为与光学时钟系统中的超辐射拍频类似。

Conclusion: 该方法未来可通过动态解耦优化，为量子传感应用提供潜在可能性。

Abstract: In this Letter, we propose that superradiant echoes can be achieved at room
temperature by applying a laser illumination and a microwave Hahn echo sequence
to a diamond with a high concentration of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers placed
in a dielectric microwave cavity. We identify that the combined action of two
microwave driving pulses and a free evolution imprints a phase grating among NV
spin sub-ensembles in frequency space, and multiple re-phasing of the grated
spin sub-ensembles leads to multiple superradiant echoes through a collective
coupling with the cavity. Furthermore, we show that the superradiant echoes can
be actively tailored with the microwave pulses and the laser illumination by
modifying the grating parameters, and the multiple re-phasing dynamics is
analogous to the one leading to superradiant beats in optical clock system. In
the future, the spin sub-ensembles grating and the resulting echoes can be
further optimized with dynamical decoupling, which might pave the way for
applications in quantum sensing.

Motivation: 研究量子计算中滤波技术的性能，特别是基于QPE的滤波器，以优化低能谱模拟和连续谱计算。

Method: 使用QPE算法，比较矩形、正弦和Kaiser窗口函数的滤波效果，并通过数值模拟比较QPE滤波与QETU的查询效率。

Result: Kaiser窗口能有效抑制Gibbs现象，且查询效率与优化后的QETU相当；提出的两步算法适用于低能谱模拟。

Conclusion: QPE滤波结合Kaiser窗口是一种高效且实用的量子计算滤波方法，适用于连续谱计算和低能谱模拟。

Abstract: Filtering is an important technique in quantum computing used for isolating
or enhancing some specific states of quantum many-body systems. In this paper,
we analyze the performance of filters based on the quantum phase estimation
(QPE) algorithm, in which filtering removes states associated with bitstrings
in the ancilla register above a given threshold. We show that when the
conventional rectangular window function is used for the QPE input state, the
resulting filter function exhibits an oscillating behavior known as the Gibbs
phenomenon. We also show that in the case of the sine and Kaiser windows, this
phenomenon is suppressed. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to
compare the number of necessary queries to the Hamiltonian time evolution
operation of for the QPE-based filtering algorithm and the quantum eigenvalue
transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QETU). We find that
the number of queries required for Kaiser window-based filtering is comparable
to that for QETU with optimized phase angles. As an application of the
QPE-based filter, we also study a two-step algorithm for low-energy spectral
simulations, composed of a coarse grid for filtering and a fine grid for
obtaining final high-resolution spectra. As a benchmark of the proposed scheme
for realistic continuous spectra, we present the density-of-states (DOS)
calculation of antiferromagnetic type-II MnO in a one-particle approximation.

Motivation: 复合脉冲在核磁共振等领域广泛应用，但其鲁棒性的理论解释尚不完善。本文旨在通过经典力学概念提供新的视角。

Method: 将布洛赫球上的运动映射到典型坐标系，利用稳定性矩阵元素消失对应系综聚焦的特性进行分析。

Result: 揭示了CPs如何在不同方向上重新聚焦系综，并明确了CPs何时能改变系综宽度而非仅旋转轴。

Conclusion: 通过经典力学方法，为CPs的鲁棒性提供了新的理论支持，并以Levitt的CP为例验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Composite Pulses (CPs) are widely used in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR),
optical spectroscopy, optimal control experiments and quantum computing to
manipulate systems that are well-described by a two-level Hamiltonian. A
careful design of these pulses can allow the refocusing of an ensemble at a
desired state, even if the ensemble experiences imperfections in the magnitude
of the external field or resonance offsets. Since the introduction of CPs,
several theoretical justifications for their robustness have been suggested. In
this work, we suggest another justification based on the classical mechanical
concept of a stability matrix. The motion on the Bloch Sphere is mapped to a
canonical system of coordinates and the focusing of an ensemble corresponds to
caustics, or the vanishing of an appropriate stability matrix element in the
canonical coordinates. Our approach highlights the directionality of the
refocusing of the ensemble on the Bloch Sphere, revealing how different
ensembles refocus along different directions. The approach also clarifies when
CPs can induce a change in the width of the ensemble as opposed to simply a
rotation of the axes. As a case study, we investigate the $90(x)180(y)90(x)$ CP
introduced by Levitt, where the approach provides a new perspective into why
this CP is effective.

Abstract: Portable quantum technologies require robust, lightweight apparatus with
superior performance. For techniques dependent upon high-vacuum environments,
such as atom interferometers and atomic clocks, 3D-printing enables new avenues
to tailor in-vacuum gas propagation dynamics. We demonstrate intricate,
fine-scale surface patterning of 3D-printed vacuum components to increase the
rate at which gas particles collide with the surface. By applying a
non-evaporable getter coating for use as a surface pump, we show that the
patterned surface pumps gas particles 3.8 times faster than an equivalent flat
areas. These patterns can be directly integrated into additively manufactured
components, enabling application in close proximity to key experimental regions
and contributing to overall mass-reduction. We develop numerical simulations
that show good agreement with this result and predict up to a ten-fold increase
in pumping rate, for realistic surface structures. Our work has direct
applications in enabling passively-pumped portable quantum technologies, but
also establishes 3D-printing as a powerful technique for the creation of
optimized surface patterning to provide enhanced control over high-vacuum gas
dynamics for a broad range of applications.

Abstract: The next generation of telecommunication networks will rely on the
transmission of complex quantum states to enable secure and transformative
information processing, utilizing entanglement and superposition. Cluster
states - multipartite entangled states that retain entanglement under local
measurements - are a vital resource for quantum networking applications such as
blind photonic quantum computing, quantum state teleportation and all-photonic
quantum repeaters. However, the transmission of cluster states over optical
fiber has remained elusive with previous approaches. Here, we demonstrate the
first transmission of a four-qubit cluster state over 25 km of single-mode
fiber by using a two-photon multi-level time-bin encoding. We directly generate
the state by exploiting coherent control of a parametric generation process,
rendering a resource-intensive controlled-phase gate obsolete. To enable
efficient and reconfigurable projective measurements on the multi-level
time-bin encoded state, we introduce chirped-pulse modulation and implement the
first time-bin beam splitter, allowing us to certify genuine multipartite
entanglement and to demonstrate one-way computing operations. Our approach
enables the transmission of complex quantum states over long-distance fibers,
permitting the implementation of multipartite protocols and laying the
foundation for large-scale quantum resource networks.

Abstract: Time crystals constitute a novel phase of matter defined by the spontaneous
breaking of time-translation symmetry. We present a scheme for realizing a
continuous-time crystal using the vibrational phonon mode of a trapped-ion
system. By coupling two addressable standing-wave lasers to individual ions via
adiabatic elimination, we generate a nonlinear phonon mode with controllable
linear gain ($g$) and nonlinear damping ($\kappa$). This scheme enables stable
dissipative dynamics over timescales significantly longer than the oscillation
period, leading to the emergence of time-translation symmetry breaking - a time
crystal - under specific conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the experimental
feasibility and numerically demonstrate this phonon time crystal using
experimentally feasible parameters. These results provide a practical scheme
for observing a time crystal in a nonlinear phonon mode, which will advance
research into time crystals.

Abstract: We present an exact analytical solution of the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation
in a precise Markovian limit for a system of two harmonically coupled harmonic
oscillators interacting with a common thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. The
thermal bath is initially considered to be at arbitrary temperatures and
characterized by an Ohmic Lorentz-Drude spectral density. In the examined
system, couplings between the two harmonic oscillators and the environment
ensure a complete decoupling of the center-of-mass and relative degrees of
freedom, resulting in undamped dynamics in the relative coordinate. The exact
time evolution is used to analyze the system's entanglement dynamics,
quantified through logarithmic negativity and quantum mutual information, while
ensuring the positivity of the density operator to confirm the physical
validity of the results. We demonstrate that, under certain parameter regimes
and initial conditions, the asymptotic dynamics can give rise to periodic
entanglement-disentanglement behavior. Furthermore, numerical simulations
reveal that for negative values of the direct coupling between the oscillators,
which are sufficiently close to a critical lower bound beyond which the system
becomes unstable, the system can maintain entanglement across a broad
temperature range and for arbitrarily long durations.

Abstract: A magnetic field enables the interconversion of photons and gravitons, yet
the process is usually analysed only at the level of classical wave equations.
We revisit photon-graviton conversion in a quantum field theoretic framework,
allowing us to track the evolution of arbitrary quantum states. Treating the
photons as squeezed coherent states and the gravitons as the squeezed vacuum
expected for primordial gravitational waves, we derive analytic expressions for
the conversion probability and show that it can be significantly enhanced
compared to the conventional estimate. We further demonstrate that the
conversion both swaps preexisting entanglement and generates genuinely new
entanglement between the electromagnetic and gravitational sectors, which is
impossible in any classical description. Detecting such nonclassical
correlations would constitute compelling evidence for the quantization of
gravity and offers a novel pathway toward graviton detection.

Abstract: Multiphoton entangled states are a key resource for quantum networks and
measurement-based quantum computation. Scalable protocols for generating such
states using solid-state spin-photon interfaces have recently emerged, but
practical implementations have so far relied on emitters operating at short
wavelengths, incompatible with low-loss fibre transmission. Here, we take a key
step towards the generation of telecom wavelength multi-qubit entangled states
using an InAs/InP quantum dot. After establishing that all essential criteria
for generating cluster states using a ground state spin as the entangler are
satisfied, we implement a scalable protocol to entangle the resident spin with
sequentially emitted photons directly in the telecom C-band. We demonstrate a
two-qubit (spin-photon) entanglement fidelity of $59.5\pm 8.7\%$ and a lower
bound of three-qubit (spin-photon-photon) entanglement fidelity of $52.7\pm
11.4\%$. Our results close the performance gap between short-wavelength quantum
dot systems and the existing telecom infrastructure, establishing a route
towards practical large photonic cluster states for fibre-based quantum network
applications.

Abstract: Scaling beyond individual quantum devices via distributed quantum computing
relies critically on high-fidelity quantum state transfers between devices, yet
the quantum interconnects needed for this are currently unavailable or expected
to be significantly noisy. These limitations can be bypassed by simulating
ideal state transfer using quasiprobability decompositions (QPDs). Wire
cutting, for instance, allows this even without quantum interconnects.
Nevertheless, QPD methods face drawbacks, requiring sampling from multiple
circuit variants and incurring substantial sampling overhead. While prior
theoretical work showed that incorporating noisy interconnects within QPD
protocols could reduce sampling overhead relative to interconnect quality, a
practical implementation for realistic conditions was lacking. Addressing this
gap, this work presents a generalized and practical QPD for state transfer
simulation using noisy interconnects to reduce sampling overhead. The QPD
incorporates a single tunable parameter for straightforward calibration to any
utilized interconnect. To lower practical costs, the work also explores
reducing the number of distinct circuit variants required by the QPD.
Experimental validation on contemporary quantum devices confirms the proposed
QPD's practical feasibility and expected sampling overhead reduction under
realistic noise. Notably, the results show higher effective state transfer
fidelity than direct transfer over the underlying noisy interconnect.

Abstract: Combining quantum computing techniques in the form of amplitude amplification
with classical reinforcement learning has led to the so-called "hybrid agent
for quantum-accessible reinforcement learning", which achieves a quadratic
speedup in sample complexity for certain learning problems. So far, this hybrid
agent has only been applied to stationary learning problems, that is, learning
problems without any time dependency within components of the Markov decision
process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of the hybrid agent to
dynamic RL environments. To this end, we enhance the hybrid agent by
introducing a dissipation mechanism and, with the resulting learning agent,
perform an empirical comparison with a classical RL agent in an RL environment
with a time-dependent reward function. Our findings suggest that the modified
hybrid agent can adapt its behavior to changes in the environment quickly,
leading to a higher average success probability compared to its classical
counterpart.

conditional normalizing flows with parameterized quantum circuits to
efficiently generate high-quality variational parameters. By embedding a
generative model into the VQE optimization loop through preference-based
training, Flow-VQE enables quantum gradient-free optimization and offers a
systematic approach for parameter transfer, accelerating convergence across
related problems through warm-started optimization. We compare Flow-VQE to a
number of standard benchmarks through numerical simulations on molecular
systems, including hydrogen chains, water, ammonia, and benzene. We find that
Flow-VQE outperforms baseline optimization algorithms, achieving computational
accuracy with fewer circuit evaluations (improvements range from modest to more
than two orders of magnitude) and, when used to warm-start the optimization of
new systems, accelerates subsequent fine-tuning by up to 50-fold compared with
Hartree--Fock initialization. Therefore, we believe Flow-VQE can become a
pragmatic and versatile paradigm for leveraging generative modeling to reduce
the costs of variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: The analysed in this paper new class of $s$-tight IC measurements contains
both morphophoric measurements, preserving the geometry of the states space,
and tight IC measurements, introduced nearly 20 years ago by Scott in the
quantum case as optimal for the task of linear quantum tomography. By looking
at the mathematical side of these classes we discover their common feature,
which is also preserved in the broader class of $s$-tight IC measurements: a
particularly elegant form of the formula that can be seen as the generalised
form of the Urgleichung known from the QBist approach to quantum theory. In
particular, the tight IC measurements are identified as the ones for which this
generalised Urgleichung takes an exceptionally simple form.

Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum gates controlled by classical electromagnetic fields form
the basis of any realistic model of quantum computers. In this letter, we
derive a lower bound on the field energy required to implement such gates and
relate this energy to the expected gate error. We study the entangleability
(ability to entangle qubits) of Hamiltonians and highlight how this feature of
quantum gates can provide a means for more energetically efficient computation.
Ultimately, we show that a universal quantum computer can be realized with
vanishingly low energetic requirements but at the expense of arbitrarily large
complexity.

Abstract: Braiding has attracted significant attention in physics because of its
important role in describing the fundamental exchange of particles. Infusing
the braiding with topological protection will make it robust against
imperfections and perturbations, but such topological braiding is believed to
be possible only in interacting quantum systems, e.g., topological
superconductors. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new strategy of topological
braiding that emerges from non-Abelian topological insulators, a class of
recently discovered multi-band topological phase. We unveil a mathematical
connection between braiding and non-Abelian quaternion invariants, by which
Bloch eigenmodes under parallel transport produce braid sequences protected by
the non-Abelian band topology. The braiding is also associated with geometric
phases quantized over half the Brillouin zone. This new type of non-Abelian
topological braiding is experimentally realized in acoustic systems with
periodic synthetic dimensions. The results show that the principle discovered
here is a new strategy towards topological braiding and can be extended for
other types of classical waves and non-interacting quantum systems.

Abstract: Topological protection offers a robust solution to the challenges of noise
and loss in physical systems. By integrating topological physics into optics,
loading and encoding quantum states into topological invariants can provide
resilience to information systems in the face of environmental disruptions.
Here, we demonstrate on-chip loading and entanglement-assisted transfer of
photon topology, where the topological structure is coherently encoded in a
single-photon spin-textured quantum state, which can be transferred, through
entanglement distribution, into a non-local quantum-correlated topology shared
between two entangled photons. Throughout the transfer process, the topology
remains protected against substantial background noise as well as isotropic and
anisotropic disturbances, while quantum correlations persist. Our framework for
loading and transferring topology is compatible with quantum teleportation when
ancillary photons are introduced, thereby promising the development of
distributed quantum systems with inherently secure and protected information
channels. This approach serves as a step toward building robust quantum
interconnects and advancing distributed quantum information technology mediated
by topology.

Abstract: The study of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics remains one of the
most exciting research frontiers of physics, standing at the crossroads of our
understanding of complex quantum phenomena and the realization of quantum
advantage. Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically
require deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and
imperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum
circuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for
quantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising
path forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational
ansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli
propagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that
implement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and
beyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to
$30 \times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard
Trotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To
experimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on
Quantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's
dynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without
optimization. Our circuit compression scheme brings us one step closer to a
practical quantum advantage by allowing longer simulation times at reduced
quantum resources and unlocks the exploration of large families of
hardware-friendly ans\"atze.

Method: 通过16量子比特电路生成量子相关先验，将其与传统高斯先验混合，并集成到WGAN、SNGAN和BigGAN中，不改变网络结构或超参数。

Conclusion: 量子随机性和硬件噪声可作为有效的归纳偏置，为深度生成模型提供新思路，展示了量子计算与机器学习的结合潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to generative adversarial networks (GANs) in
which the standard i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior is replaced or hybridized with
a quantum-correlated prior derived from measurements of a 16-qubit entangling
circuit. Each latent sample is generated by grouping repeated shots per qubit
into a binary fraction, applying the inverse Gaussian CDF to obtain a
16-dimensional Gaussian vector whose joint copula reflects genuine quantum
entanglement, and then projecting into the high-dimensional space via a fixed
random matrix. By pre-sampling tens of millions of bitstrings, either from a
noiseless simulator or from IBM hardware, we build large pools of independent
but internally quantum-correlated latents. We integrate this prior into three
representative architectures (WGAN, SNGAN, BigGAN) on CIFAR-10, making no
changes to the neural network structure or training hyperparameters. The hybrid
latent representations incorporating hardware-derived noise consistently lower
the FID relative to both the classical baseline and the simulator variant,
especially when the quantum component constitutes a substantial fraction of the
prior. In addition, we execute on the QPU in parallel to not only save
computing time but also further decrease the FID up to 17% in BigGAN. These
results indicate that intrinsic quantum randomness and device-specific
imperfections can provide a structured inductive bias that enhances GAN
performance. Our work demonstrates a practical pipeline for leveraging noisy
quantum hardware to enrich deep-generative modeling, opening a new interface
between quantum information and machine learning. All code and data are

Abstract: To move towards the utility era of quantum computing, many corporations have
posed distributed quantum computing (DQC) as a framework for scaling the
current generation of devices for practical applications. One of these
applications is quantum chemistry, also known as electronic structure theory,
which has been poised as a "killer application" of quantum computing, To this
end, we analyze five electronic structure methods, found in common packages
such as Tequila and ffsim, which can be easily interfaced with the Qiskit
Circuit Cutting addon. Herein, we provide insights into cutting these
algorithms using local operations (LO) to determine their aptitude for
distribution. The key findings of our work are that many of these algorithms
cannot be efficiently parallelized using LO, and new methods must be developed
to apply electronic structure theory within a DQC framework.

Abstract: Feedback control in open quantum dynamics is crucial for the advancement of
various coherent platforms. For a proper theoretical description, however, most
feedback schemes rely on stochastic trajectories, which require significant
statistical sampling and lack analytical insight. Currently, only a handful of
deterministic feedback master equations exist in the literature. In this letter
we derive a set of deterministic equations for describing feedback schemes
based on generic causal signals. Our formulation is phrased in terms of
sequentially applied quantum instruments, and is therefore extremely general,
recovering various known results in the literature as particular cases. We then
specialize this result to the case of quantum jumps and derive a new
deterministic equation that allows for feedback based on the channel of the
last jump, as well as the time since the last jump occurred. The strength of
this formalism is illustrated with a detailed study of population inversion of
a qubit using coherent drive and feedback, where our formalism allows all
calculations to be performed analytically.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the physical action $S$ for random
graphs, by treating the number of neighbors at each vertex of the graph
(degree), as a scalar field. For each configuration (run) of the graph we
calculate the Lagrangian of the degree field by using a lattice quantum field
theory(LQFT) approach. Then the corresponding action is calculated by
integrating the Lagrangian over all the vertices of the graph. We implement an
evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental
quantum of time, resulting in different evolution paths based on the run that
is chosen at each evolution step. We calculate the action along each of these
evolution paths, which allows us to calculate the probability distribution of
$S$. We find that the distribution approaches the normal(Gaussian) form as the
graph becomes denser, by adding more edges between its vertices. The maximum of
the probability distribution of the action corresponds to graph configurations
whose spacing between the values of $S$ becomes zero $\Delta S=0$,
corresponding to the least-action (Hamilton) principle, which gives the path
that the physical system follows classically. In addition, we calculate the
fluctuations(variance) of the degree field showing that the graph
configurations corresponding to the maximum probability of $S$, which follow
the Hamilton's principle, have a balanced structure between regular and
irregular graphs.

Conclusion: 该方法为理解一维系统的拓扑性质提供了稳健框架，适用于复杂模型和实验连接。

Abstract: Topological invariants, such as the winding number, the Chern number, and the
Zak phase, characterize the topological phases of bulk materials. Through the
bulk-boundary correspondence, these topological phases have a one-to-one
correspondence to topological edge states, which are robust to certain classes
of disorder. For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the
computation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however,
in multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce
the unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk
topological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically
to evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large
number of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all
topological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants,
such as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments,
we determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like
configuration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave
certain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending
on their symmetry properties. Our approach is illustrated using different
one-dimensional models, providing a robust framework for understanding
topological properties in one-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and
optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in
energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising
cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its
electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as
grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping
methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough
transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling
complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale
microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach
for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated
generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the
analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning
architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional
Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated,
using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM
algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin
Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer
achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural
predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary
delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring
the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based
image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine
learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural
characterization.

Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its generalisations to dissipative and
dipolar gases have been very useful in describing dynamics of cold atomic
gases, as well as polaritons and other nonlinear systems. For some of these
applications the numerically accessible grid spacing can become a limiting
factor, especially in describing turbulent dynamics and short-range effects of
dipole-dipole interactions. We explore the application of tensor networks to
these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics),
they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations
possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical
simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex
formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in
combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum
Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both
equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods
has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are
generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas
experiments that are challenging for existing methods.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of dark solitons in a one-dimensional
Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a curved geometry. Using the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation in curvilinear coordinates and a perturbative
expansion in the local curvature, we derive a set of coupled evolution
equations for the soliton velocity and the curvature. For the case of constant
curvature, such as circular geometries, the soliton dynamics is governed solely
by the initial velocity and curvature. Remarkably, the soliton travels a nearly
constant angular trajectory across two orders of magnitude in curvature,
suggesting an emergent conserved quantity, independent of its initial velocity.
We extend our analysis to elliptical trajectories with spatially varying
curvature and show that soliton dynamics remain determined by the local
curvature profile. In these cases, the model of effective constant curvature
describes accurately the dynamics given the local curvature has smooth
variation. When the soliton crosses regions of rapid curvature variation and/or
non-monotonic behavior, the model fails to describe to soliton dynamics,
although the overall behavior can still be fully mapped to the curvature
profile. Our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the
role of geometry in soliton dynamics and pave the way for future studies of
nonlinear excitations in curved quantum systems.

Abstract: The Josephson effect presents a fundamental example of macroscopic quantum
coherence as well as a crucial enabler for metrology (e.g. voltage standard),
sensing (e.g. Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) and quantum
information processing (Josephson qubits). Recently, there has been a major
renewal of interest in the effect, following its observation in Bose, Fermi,
and dipolar atomic condensates, in exciton-polariton condensates, and in
momentum space. We present theoretically a nondestructive, \textit{in situ} and
real time protocol for observing the AC and DC Josephson effects including
integer (recently observed in cold atoms) and fractional (hitherto unobserved
in cold atoms) Shapiro steps, using a ring condensate coupled to an optical
cavity. Our analysis presents a metrology standard that does not require
measurmement of atomic number and that challenges the conventional wisdom that
quantum computations cannot be observed without being destroyed. Our results
have implications for the fields of atomtronics, sensing, metrology and quantum
information processing.

Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional three-component few-fermion mixture confined

the interactions between the impurity and the other components influence the

identify a critical interaction strength with the impurity for which the system
undergoes a structural transition characterized by substantial change in its
spatial features. We explore this transition from the point of view of
correlations and ground-state susceptibility. We remarkably find that this
transition exhibits unique universality features not previously observed in
other systems, highlighting novel many-body properties existing in
multi-component fermionic mixtures.

Conclusion: 研究为非互易场理论提供了微观基础，连接了非平衡统计力学与宏观连续描述。

Abstract: We construct the dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields
for cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two
microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field
approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially
resolved magnetization in each lattice. For single spin-flip dynamics, the
macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the
nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent.
Likewise, for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic
limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e.
with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and
between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that
add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map
out the linear instabilities that can arise. Our results provide a microscopic
foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a
direct link between non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic
continuum descriptions.

Result: 证明了电流涨落受限于熵产生率，并在特定模型中验证了界限的渐近饱和。

Conclusion: 电流涨落（典型和罕见）均受限于系统的耗散，为相干输运提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the large-deviation functions of particle
currents in coherent conductors. This bound depends only on the mean value of
the relevant current and the total rate of entropy production required to
maintain a non-equilibrium steady state, thus showing that both typical and
rare current fluctuations are ultimately constrained by dissipation. Our
analysis relies on the scattering approach to quantum transport and applies to
any multi-terminal setup with arbitrary chemical potential and temperature
gradients, provided the transmission coefficients between reservoirs are
symmetric. This condition is satisfied for any two-terminal system and, more
generally, when the dynamics of particles within the conductor are symmetric
under time-reversal. For typical current fluctuations, we recover a recently
derived thermodynamic uncertainty relation for coherent transport. To
illustrate our theory, we analyze a specific model comprising two reservoirs
connected by a chain of quantum dots, which shows that our bound can be
saturated asymptotically.

Abstract: Although one-dimensional classical spin chains do not exhibit phase
transitions, we found that a phase transition does occur when they are coupled
to a cavity photon mode. This provides one of the simplest examples
demonstrating that finite-temperature superradiant phase transitions can emerge
from long-range fully connected interactions mediated by photons and
interactions within the material.

Abstract: Quenched disorder in absorbing phase transitions can disrupt the structure
and symmetry of reaction-diffusion processes, affecting their phase transition
characteristics and offering a more accurate mapping to real physical systems.
In the directed percolation (DP) universality class, time quenching is
implemented through the dynamic setting of transition probabilities. We
developed a non-uniform distribution time quenching method in the
(1+1)-dimensional DP model, where the random quenching follows a L\'evy
distribution. We use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to study its phase structure
and universality class. The critical point measurements show that this model
has a critical region controlling the transition between the absorbing and
active states, which changes as the parameter $ \beta $, influencing the
distribution properties varies. Guided by dynamic scaling laws, we measured the
continuous variation of critical exponents: particle density decay exponent
$\alpha$, total particle number change exponent $ \theta $, and dynamic
exponent $z$. This evidence establishes that the universality class of
L\'evy-quenched DP systems evolves with distribution properties. The
L\'evy-distributed quenching mechanism we introduced has broad potential
applications in the theory and experiments of various absorbing phase
transitions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的非平衡机制，通过非马尔可夫耗散与守恒定律慢模的相互作用，稳定低维系统中的长程有序。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨如何在非平衡系统中绕过Mermin-Wagner定理，实现低维连续对称性自发破缺和长程有序。

Method: 研究一类$O(N)$对称模型，分析非马尔可夫耗散与守恒定律慢模的相互作用。

Result: 发现单独的非马尔可夫耗散不足以稳定长程有序，但结合慢模可有效抑制涨落。

Conclusion: 非马尔可夫耗散与慢模的协同作用为低维非平衡系统中的长程有序提供了新机制。

Abstract: It is now well established that the Mermin-Wagner theorem can be circumvented
in nonequilibrium systems, allowing for the spontaneous breaking of a
continuous symmetry and the emergence of long-range order in low dimensions.
However, only a few models demonstrating this violation are known, and they
often rely on specific mechanisms that may not be generally applicable. In this
work, we identify a new mechanism for nonequilibrium-induced long-range order
in a class of $O(N)$-symmetric models. Inspired by the role of long-range
spatial interactions in equilibrium, consider the effect of non-Markovian
dissipation, in stabilizing long range order in low-dimensional nonequilibrium
systems. We find that this alone is insufficient, but the interplay of
non-Markovian dissipation and slow modes due to conservation laws can
effectively suppress fluctuations and stabilize long-range order.

Abstract: The insulating chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ exhibits a rich array of
low-temperature magnetic phenomena, making it a prime candidate for the study
of its spin dynamics. Using spin wave small-angle neutron scattering (SWSANS),
we systematically investigated the temperature-dependent behavior of the
helimagnon excitations in the field-polarized phase of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Our
measurements, spanning 5-55 K, reveal the temperature evolution of spin-wave
stiffness and damping constant with unprecedented resolution, facilitated by
the insulating nature of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. These findings align with theoretical
predictions and resolve discrepancies observed in previous studies, emphasizing
the enhanced sensitivity of the SWSANS method. The results provide deeper
insights into the fundamental magnetic properties of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$,

Result: 发现O(4)原初算子由SO(5)分解而来，标量算子的存在支持伪临界性。

Conclusion: 模糊球方案为临界现象研究提供了新视角，揭示了O(4) DQCP的本质。

Abstract: The deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), which separates two distinct
symmetry-broken phases, was conjectured to be an example of (2+1)D criticality
beyond the standard Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. However, this hypothesis
has been met with challenges and remains elusive. Here, we perform a systematic
study of a microscopic model realizing the DQCP with a global symmetry tunable
from $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ to $\mathrm{O}(4)$. Through the lens of fuzzy sphere
regularization, we uncover the key information on the renormalization group
flow of conformal operators. We reveal O(4) primaries decomposed from original
SO(5) primaries by tracing conformal operator content and identifying the
``avoided level crossing'' in the operator flows. In particular, we find that
the existence of a scalar operator, in support of the nature of
pseudo-criticality, remains relevant, persisting from $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ to
$\mathrm{O}(4)$ DQCP. This work not only uncovers the nature of O(4) DQCP but
also demonstrates that the fuzzy sphere scheme offers a unique perspective on
the renormalization group flow of operators in the study of critical phenomena.

Abstract: Kondo insulators are a paradigmatic strongly correlated electron system,
arising from the hybridization between itinerary conduction electrons and
localized magnetic moments, which opens a gap in the band of conduction
electrons. Traditionally, the known Kondo insulators are found in materials
with f-electrons. Recent developments in two-dimensional (2D) moire systems
provide a new approach to generate flat bands with strong electron correlation,
which host localized moments at half filling. In this work, we demonstrate the
realization of a Kondo insulator phase in a moire superlattice of monolayer WS2
/ bilayer WSe2 which hosts a set of moire flat bands in the WSe2 layer
interfacing the WS2 layer and dispersive bands in the other WSe2 layer. When
both WSe2 layers are partially doped but with a total density of two holes per
moire unit cell, an insulating state appears when the density of the moire band
is below one hole per moire unit cell. The insulating state disappears above a
certain threshold magnetic field and the system becomes metallic, which is a
telltale signature of the Kondo insulator. The physics can be well explained by
a periodic Anderson lattice model that includes both the on-site Coulomb
repulsion in the moire flat band and the hybridization between moire flat and
non-moire dispersive bands. Our results suggest that multilayer moire
structures of transition metal dichalcogenides provide a tunable platform to
simulate the Kondo insulator, which holds promise to tackle many critical open
questions in the Kondo insulators.

Motivation: 传统方法在数值计算中难以有效区分弱一级相变和去约束量子临界点，需要高精度数据。

Result: RTE和DRTE的标度关系成功确定了多种量子多体系统的相变点和临界指数，并有效检测了弱一级相变。

Conclusion: DRTE为研究量子多体相变提供了新的有效工具，尤其在检测弱一级相变方面表现出色。

Abstract: In principle, the logarithm of the partition function and its derivatives can
be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, in
practice, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations, since
resolving the singularities of the logarithmic partition function requires
extremely high precision data especially when distinguishing between weakly
first order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on
the finite size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution
to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be
extracted by eliminating the leading volume-law term. This is achieved by
computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have
derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine
the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in
various quantum many body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating
quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting
weakly first order phase transitions, such as in $ JQ $ models, which were
initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The
discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional
local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for
studying quantum many body phase transitions.

Conclusion: Li2Ni3P4O14是罕见的二维三聚化自旋系统，实验证实了理论预测的磁振子激发。

Abstract: We report the magnetic ground state, spin excitations, and spin Hamiltonian
of the 2D spin-1 trimerized Heisenberg antiferromagnet Li2Ni3P4O14. Below the
magnetic ordering temperature TN = 14.5 K, the compound exhibits a canted
long-range antiferromagnetic order with a propagation vector k = (0 0 0),
consistent with the magnetic space group P21/c.1 (No. 14.75). The ground state
magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic spin-trimers of Ni2+ ions. The
spin-trimers are coupled antiferromagnetically along the c-axis and
ferromagnetically along the a-axis. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) reveals
gapped and dispersive magnon excitations below the TN, and gapless
quasi-elastic scatterings at higher temperature. The linear spin-wave theory
simulations reveal the essential features of the excitation spectrum; by a spin
Hamiltonian composed of ferromagnetic intra-trimer exchange interaction J1 and
inter-trimer exchange interactions J2 (FM) and J3(AFM) within the bc plane. The
J2 and J3 along the b-axis and c-axis, respectively, with strengths of
J2/J1=0.79 and J3/J1=-0.91. In addition, a weak inter planer ferromagnetic
exchange interaction J4 (|J4/J1|~0.12) is found along the a-axis. The
determined exchange constants reveal a 2D trimerized Collinear-II spin lattice
within the bc-plane. The analysis of INS spectra by linear spin-wave theory
also yields a moderate single-ion anisotropy (D/J1=0.48) which accounts for the
observed spin gap below TN as well as the metamagnetic transition near 44 kOe
in dc magnetization (M vs H) curves. These findings identify Li2Ni3P4O14 as a
rare realization of a two-dimensional trimerized spin system and offer the
direct experimental confirmation of theoretically predicted magnon excitations,
unveiling the fundamental characteristics of the expected excitation spectrum.

Conclusion: 该研究为连续对称性自发破缺提供了新的范例，并揭示了其稳健性。

Abstract: It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is
restricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D
ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order
parameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently
found frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed
symmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this work, we have
discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples -- a 1D
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model -- that can achieve spontaneous breaking of
continuous symmetry. Importantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its
order parameter does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range
order is robust under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical
simulation and theoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood
this nontrivial phenomenon.

Abstract: Quantum geometry, including quantum metric and Berry curvature, which
describes the topology of electronic states, can induce fascinating physical
properties. Symmetry-dependent nonlinear transport has emerged as a sensitive
probe of these quantum geometric properties. However, its interplay with strong
electronic correlations has rarely been explored in bulk materials,
particularly in a Kondo lattice system. Here, we uncover correlation-driven
quantum geometry in centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic iron telluride (FeTe). We
experimentally observe the quantum metric quadrupole-induced third-order
nonlinear transport, whose angular dependence reflects magnetic structure in
FeTe. The nonlinear transport signals follow Kondo lattice crossover and vanish
at high temperatures. Our theory suggests that a Kondo lattice formed at low
temperatures explains the emergence of quantum geometry, which is induced by
the opening of a hybridization gap near the Fermi energy. This discovery
establishes a paradigm where quantum geometry arises not from static symmetry
breaking but from dynamic many-body effects and provides a zero-field probe for
sensing antiferromagnetic order.

Motivation: Fermi-Hubbard模型难以精确求解，需验证方法的有效性及其对基态物理性质的描述能力。

Method: 采用Tensor-Backflow方法，研究不同相互作用强度、电子填充和边界条件下的二维晶格模型。

Result: 能量精度显著提升，部分情况下优于现有张量网络方法，且成功获得线性条纹序。

Conclusion: Tensor-Backflow方法在Fermi-Hubbard模型中具有竞争力，适用于多种物理条件。

Abstract: Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of
backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving
Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging
to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground
state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of
backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the
Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on
two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction
strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision
can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering
backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy
extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient
optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of
$n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition,
by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only
$4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond
dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational
wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe
order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies
obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are
lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive
to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of
$n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are
obtained by direct optimizations.

Abstract: In this work, we discuss a pedagogical method in deriving the expressions for
anomalous position and velocity. While we follow the steps used in optics in
the derivation of the group velocity, we use Bloch wave functions instead of
plane wave states. In comparison to the plane wave case, application of Bloch
wave functions results in two additional terms in the expression of the group
velocity: the Berry phase factor and anomalous position contributions. These
two new terms with distinct origins eventually lead to the known anomalous
velocity. Aiming for an intuitive understanding, we simulate the situation
under an electric field using linear-combination-of-atomic-orbital states and
visually demonstrate that the envelope function exhibits the transverse motion
expected from an anomalous velocity.

Abstract: Based on the calculation and analysis of local Green functions of impurity
atoms of low concentration in a two-dimensional graphene lattice, the
conditions for the formation and characteristics of local discrete levels with
energies lying outside the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum and
quasi-localized states with energies near the Fermi one are determined.
Specific calculations were performed for boron and nitrogen impurity atoms,
which can actually replace carbon in graphite and graphene nanostructures. For
a boron impurity that forms local discrete levels outside the band of the
quasi-continuous spectrum, sufficiently simple analytical expressions for the
conditions for their formation, energy, intensity at the impurity atom, and
damping parameter are obtained. An analysis of the formation of states
quasi-localized on nitrogen impurities with energy near the Fermi level in
graphene nanostructures was carried out.

Abstract: Nanomechanical systems are critical platforms for precision measurement,
sensing, macroscopic quantum physics, and emerging quantum-information
technologies. In these applications, high mechanical quality factors, often
achieved using dissipation dilution, are important since they directly enhance
measurement sensitivity and quantum coherence. However, surface stiction
intrinsic to nanoscale structures severely limits their performance. Here, we
transform this longstanding obstacle into a solution for tension-enabled
dissipation dilution, via a novel van der Waals (vdW) self-assembly method.
Leveraging intrinsic nanoscale surface interactions, we achieve controlled
tensile stresses up to 1.3GPa in single-crystal diamond--an ideal but
notoriously difficult material to strain-engineer--without introducing
additional interface losses. We demonstrate mechanical quality factors
exceeding 100 million at 5K, surpassing state-of-the-art systems at comparable
aspect ratios. This versatile approach, applicable to other crystalline
materials, opens up avenues using cryogenic nanomechanical systems for
ultra-precise quantum sensing, tests of quantum gravity, and hybrid quantum
systems.

Abstract: Optical effects of quantum matter with interaction are key to physics and
technology. The class of non-Hermitian (NH) phenomena is mostly explored in
cold atoms, photonics, and metamaterials out of equilibrium. Effective NH
systems due to interaction in equilibrium solids, however, provide a unique
opportunity for realizing light-NH matter hybrids via periodic irradiation.
Given NH topological surface states with magnetic disorder, here we reveal
spectroscopically observable Floquet spin textures for this hybrid quantum
matter: merged meron strings, dichroic skyrmions, and domain structure
accompanying vortices in energy planes; Bloch lines and topologically twisted
vortex rings distinct from Hopfions in energy-momentum space; topological
selectiveness of linear polarization occurs besides circular dichroism.
Spectroscopic energy evolution and chemical potential dependence are key
ingredients of this open hybrid system. With spin-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, this scenario bears prime physical interest by reaching the
crossroad between solid-state interaction effects, non-Hermiticity, and
light-matter coupling.

Abstract: The presence of two types of holes, namely the Dirac holes and the heavy
holes, in a two-dimensional sample exposed to a weak external permanent
magnetic field leads to the emergence of the temperature and magnetic
field-dependent contribution to the resistivity due to their interactions.
Taking a HgTe-based two-dimensional semimetal as a testbed, we develop a
theoretical model describing the role of interactions between the degenerate
massive and Dirac particles for the resistivity in the presence of a classical
magnetic field. If only the Dirac holes are present in the system, the
magnetoconductivity acquires a finite interaction-induced contribution which
would be vanishing for the parabolic spectrum. It demonstrates $T^4 \ln(1/T)$
behavior at low temperatures for screened Coulomb interhole interaction
potential, asymptotically reaching $T^2$ with increasing temperature. However,
the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect are not affected by the Dirac holes
interparticle correlations. Instead, the presence of two types of holes
provides a finite contribution to the magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity,
and the classical Hall effect resistivity. The temperature behavior of the
magnetoconductivity here is $T^2$ in the case of the short-range constant
interparticle interaciton potential and $T^2 \ln(1/T)$ for the bare unscreened
Coulomb interaction.

Abstract: Effect of doped layer placed in structures with indirect band-gap
(In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots (QDs) on heterointerface sharpness is investigated.
We demonstrate that growth of n (p) doped layer below QDs sheet leads to
pronounced deceleration (acceleration) for dynamics of exciton recombination
(which is very sensitive to heterointeface structure in these QDs) in compare
with the undoped structure. Opposite, the placing of the same doped layers
above the QDs sheet does not effect on the exciton recombination dynamic at
all. The experimental data are explained by increase (decrease) charged vacancy
formation rate in the cation sublattice, that result in QD/matrix interface
bluring (sharping), with the increases in the electron (hole) concentration at
this heterointerface formation. The thicknesses of the diffuse layer on
QD/matrix heterointerface estimated is in range from 0 up to 5 in the lattice

Abstract: For non-topological quantum materials, introducing defects can significantly
alter their properties by modifying symmetry and generating a nonzero
analytical index, thus transforming the material into a topological one. We
present a method to construct the potential matrix configuration with the
purpose of obtaining a non-zero analytical index, akin to a topological
invariant like a winding or Chern number. We establish systematic connections
between these potentials, expressed in the continuum limit, and their initial
tight-binding model description. We apply our method to graphene with an
adatom, a vacancy, and both as key examples illustrating our comprehensive
description. This method enables analytical differentiation between topological
and non-topological zero-energy modes and allows for the construction of
defects that induce topology.

Abstract: The paramount acumen for controlling spin transport properties in nonmagnetic
materials is the usage of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We propose a model to
calculate the spin hall angle (SHA) for the elemental transition metal
dichalcogenide compound, $WTe_2$ entrenched on the intrinsic Rashba SOC. This
model, is based on the Landauer-Buttiker formalism for quantum transport, and
the $4$-terminal device setup with the presence of disorder from random onsite
potential fluctuations. The SHA, including the mean and RMS values, also
illustrate the mesoscopic oscillations, and the values obtained are $25\%$ and
$30\%$, respectively. The variation pattern of charge and spin current, along
with the mean and spin Hall conductance, can be a comparative measure for other
TMDs and monolayer Xenes. To validate our outcomes, we compare our results with
experimental data and numerically extract real-space simulation results based
on the nearest-neighbor tight binding (NNTB) model. Also our results are in
line with the scaling theory of localization. This work sets the stage to
calculate the spin Hall angle and spin Hall conductivity for other elemental
monolayer Xenes and TMDs, considering the intrinsic scattering mechanisms. An
extension of this work will be to explore the possible spintronics applications
for extrinsic scattering, including side-jump and skew-jump scattering
processes.

by Mie theory, and leveraging multiscattering effects, we demonstrate that

identifies configurations that maximize specific objectives, such as directing
or splitting an electron beam by tuning the angular dependence of scattering.
Our results demonstrate the potential of the TDP to provide precise control
over induced current flows in graphene, making it a promising component for
next-generation electronic and electron optic devices.

Abstract: Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum
computers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum
information non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a
shared fermionic state whose occupation -- either even or odd -- defines the
fermionic parity that encodes the qubit. Crucially, this parity cannot be
accessed by any measurement that probes only one Majorana mode. This reflects
the non-local nature of the encoding and its inherent protection against noise.
A promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain, implemented
in quantum dots coupled via superconductors. Even a minimal chain of two dots
can host a pair of Majorana modes and store quantum information in their joint
parity. Here we introduce a new technique for reading out this parity, based on
quantum capacitance. This global probe senses the joint state of the chain and
enables real-time, single-shot discrimination of the parity state. By comparing
with simultaneous local charge sensing, we confirm that only the global signal
resolves the parity. We observe random telegraph switching and extract parity
lifetimes exceeding one millisecond. These results establish the essential
readout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a
long-standing experimental challenge.

Abstract: We experimentally report a hitherto unseen angular anisotropy in the
polarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross section of a magnetically
strongly inhomogeneous material. Based on an analytical prediction using
micromagnetic theory, the difference between the spin-up and spin-down SANS
cross sections is expected to show a spin-disorder-induced anisotropy. The
effect is particularly pronounced in inhomogeneous magnetic materials, such as
nanoporous ferromagnets, magnetic nanocomposites, or steels, which exhibit
large nanoscale jumps in the saturation magnetization at internal pore-matrix
or particle-matrix interfaces. Analysis of the experimental neutron data
constitutes a method for determining the exchange-stiffness constant. Our
results are generic to the nuclear-magnetic interference terms contained in the
polarized magnetic neutron scattering cross section and might also be of
relevance to other neutron techniques.

Abstract: The plasmon is a well established collective excitation of metals in the
visible and near UV but at much lower frequencies dissipation destroys all
trace of the plasmon and typical Drude behaviour sets in. We propose a
mechanism for depression of the plasma frequency into the far infra red or even
GHz band: periodic structures build of very thin wires dilute the average
concentration of electrons and considerably enhance the effective electron mass
through self-inductance. Computations replicate the key features and confirm
our analytic theory. The new structure has novel properties not observed before
in the GHz band, including some possible impact on superconducting properties.

Abstract: Optically induced demagnetization of 3d metallic ferromagnets proceeds as
fast as ~100 fs and is a crucial prerequisite for spintronic applications, such
as ultrafast magnetization switching and spin transport. On the 100 fs time
scale, the magnetization dynamics is widely understood in the context of
temperature models considering energy transfers between conduction electrons,
magnons and crystal lattice. However, on even faster time scales, the flow of
both angular momentum and energy between these subsystems has so far not been
studied. Here, we measure ultrafast demagnetization by ultrabroadband
THz-emission spectroscopy. We find that the rate of change of the magnetization
does not rise instantaneously, but on a time scale as short as 10 fs. This rise
is a signature that a transfer of angular momentum from the magnons to
conduction electrons proceeds in less than 10 fs, before substantial
demagnetization has happened. We further conclude that most of the spin
dissipated by the lattice is transferred via magnon-lattice rather than
electron-lattice interaction. These results show that the limiting speed of
magnetization dynamics is not demagnetization, as generally believed, and
harnessing the earliest magnon dynamics could be a new route towards an even
faster spintronics.

Abstract: Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) allows the characterization of magnetic stray
field distributions with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Based on a
suitable calibration procedure, MFM can also yield quantitative magnetic field
values. This process typically involves measuring a reference sample to
determine the distribution of the tip's stray field or stray field gradient at
the sample surface. This distribution is called the tip transfer function (TTF)
and is derived through regularized deconvolution in Fourier space. The
properties of the reference sample and the noise characteristics of the
detection system significantly influence the derived TTF, thereby limiting its
validity range. In a recent study, the tip stray field distribution, and hence
the TTF, of an MFM tip was independently measured in real space using a
nitrogen vacancy center as a quantum sensor, revealing considerable
discrepancies with the reference-sample-based TTF. Here, we analyze the
influence of the feature distribution of the reference sample and the MFM
measurement parameters on the resulting TTF. We explain the observed
differences between quantum-calibrated stray field distributions and the
classical approach by attributing them to a loss of information due to missing
or suppressed spectral components. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of
the spectral coverage of the TTF. Our findings indicate that for high-quality
reconstruction of the stray field of a sample under test (SUT), it is more
critical to ensure a strong overlap of frequency components between the
reference sample and the SUT than to achieve an accurate real-space
reconstruction of the tip stray field distribution.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in orbitronics, the influence of disorder on the
orbital Hall effect and orbital relaxation mechanisms remains poorly
understood. In this work, we numerically investigate the role of disorder in
orbital transport within mesoscopic devices using a real-space tight-binding
model on a two-dimensional square lattice that hosts atomic orbitals capable of
carrying atomic orbital angular momentum. By considering devices with varying
geometries--square and rectangular--and systematically tuning disorder
strength, we examine the disorder effect on orbital Hall current (OHC)
generation, and orbital relaxation. Our results reveal a strong dependence of
the OHC and orbital Hall angle on disorder strength. In square devices, we
demonstrate that the orbital Hall response can be strongly enhanced by disorder
and its dependence on the disorder strength indicates the dominance of
skew-scattering mechanism in the diffusive regime. In rectangular geometries,
the orbital current decays exponentially with increasing device width, from
which the orbital relaxation length is extracted. These findings provide
critical insights into disorder-driven orbital transport phenomena and lay the
foundation for designing next-generation orbitronic devices.
