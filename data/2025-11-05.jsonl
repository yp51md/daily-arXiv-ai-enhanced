Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with\nnucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding\nnucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal\nthat the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a\nfundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by\na global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call\na flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a\ntriangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the\nphase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is\nrequired to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the\ntopological-ordered phase.

Despite the disturbance introduced by the separation map used in the UD\nprocess, we show that for N > 2, the \"failure\" states of UD retain residual\ninformation about the original input states, which can be further used for\ndiscrimination. Rather than discarding inconclusive outcomes as in conventional\nUD, we show that the \"failure\" states of UD can be optimally recycled by\nperforming a sequential minimum-error discrimination (MED).

These informational\ncouplings enable the transformation of a static lattice into a\nfeedback-reconfigurable medium.

Naghizadeh Ardabili", "Omid Yahyayi Monem", "Morteza Nattagh Najafi", "Hosein Mohammadzadeh"], "title": "Haldane-Inspired Generalized Statistics", "comment": "12 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "We propose and study a generalized quantum statistical framework, referred to\nas \\emph{alpha statistics}, that continuously interpolates between\nBose--Einstein and Fermi--Dirac statistics and naturally extends into the\nhyperbosonic regime for $\\alpha < 0$. Inspired by Haldane's exclusion\nstatistics, this formulation introduces a modified occupation weight function\nthat encodes effective statistical interactions via the parameter $\\alpha$.\nUsing thermodynamic geometry, we analyze the sign and singular behavior of the\nthermodynamic curvature as a diagnostic of underlying interactions and phase\nstructures. A crossover temperature $T^{*}$, at which the curvature changes\nsign, marks the transition between effectively attractive (Bose-like) and\nrepulsive (Fermi-like) statistical regimes. When expressed relative to the\nBose--Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$, the ratio $T^{*}/T_{c}$\ndepends universally on $\\alpha$. For negative $\\alpha$, corresponding to\nhyperbosonic statistics, we find curvature singularities at specific\nfugacities, indicating modified condensation phenomena distinct from\nconventional Bose condensation. These results highlight the geometric and\nthermodynamic consequences of alpha statistics and establish a link between\nfractional exclusion principles and curvature-induced interaction signatures in\nstatistical thermodynamics."}

Allowing for a system-reservoir coupling $\\gamma$, we\nnumerically describe the system dynamics through a time-dependent\nself-consistent Lindblad master equation. For a closed ($\\gamma=0$) finite-size\nsystem subjected to an interaction parameter quench, the order parameter\ndynamics exhibits oscillations and revivals. In the thermodynamic limit, our\nresults imply that the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value\nin accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). However,\ntime-dependent finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only if\n$\\gamma>0$. Our findings highlight subtle yet important aspects of the\npost-quench relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems."}

Central to these phenomena is the\nformation of Cooper pairs, correlated states of two fermions that behave as\ncomposite bosons and condense below a critical temperature. However, unlike\nelementary bosons, these pairs retain their internal structure set by\nunderlying fermionic correlations, essential for understanding superfluid\nproperties throughout the so-called Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) crossover-- a cornerstone of strongly\ncorrelated fermionic matter. Here, we harness a sonic analog of the optical\nSagnac effect to disclose the composite nature of fermionic condensates across\nthe BEC-BCS crossover. We realize an in-situ loop interferometer by coherently\nexciting two counter-propagating long-wavelength phonons of an annular\nfermionic superfluid with tuneable interparticle interactions. The frequency\ndegeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon\ncontrollably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring,\nresulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary\nquantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the\nfermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow\ncirculation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the\nconstituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the\nrelevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at\ntunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the\nunitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique\nfor probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems."}

Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates\nobservables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that\npreserves Trotter accuracy and aims at maintaining computational efficiency.\nThe framework is exact for quadratic Hamiltonians--remaining restricted to a\nfixed low-weight sector determined by the physical observable--admits\nvariational initial states, and can be extended to interacting regimes via\nsystematically controlled truncations. We benchmark our approach on one- and\ntwo-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard quenches, comparing against tensor network\nmethods (MPS and fPEPS) and recent experimental data. The method achieves high\naccuracy on timescales comparable to state-of-the-art variational techniques\nand experiments, demonstrating that controlled Majorana-string truncation is a\npractical tool for simulating two-dimensional fermionic dynamics."}
