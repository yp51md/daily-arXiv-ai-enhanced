### [1] [Looking elsewhere: improving variational Monte Carlo gradients by importance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05352)
*Antoine Misery,Luca Gravina,Alessandro Santini,Filippo Vicentini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应重要性采样策略，用于解决神经网络量子态（NQS）在变分蒙特卡洛（VMC）训练中的高方差梯度估计问题，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子化学中的尖锐波函数导致梯度估计方差高，阻碍了变分优化的有效性，需要一种高效的方法来改善采样问题。

Method: 采用自适应调整的重要性采样策略，专注于优化梯度估计而非损失函数，避免引入额外超参数且计算成本低。

Result: 在多种哈密顿量的基态搜索中验证了方法的有效性，包括受挫自旋系统和量子化学问题，计算成本降低高达100倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了VMC的计算效率，尤其在处理尖锐波函数时表现出色。

Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz
for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via
Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known
that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum
chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the
effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a
systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively
tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target
the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce
additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We
benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of
hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum
chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization
in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can
reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of
100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.

### [2] [SymTFT Approach for Mixed States with Non-Invertible Symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05350)
*Sakura Schafer-Nameki,Apoorv Tiwari,Alison Warman,Carolyn Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个研究混合态相的一般框架，涵盖强、弱对称性及非可逆对称性，通过纯化密度矩阵并在双希尔伯特空间中分类相，基于SymTFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究混合态相的分类，特别是包含非可逆对称性的情况，扩展对称性相的分类框架。

Method: 使用双希尔伯特空间中的纯化密度矩阵，基于SymTFT方法分类相，适用于群对称性和非可逆对称性。

Result: 在1+1维中分类了强（非）可逆对称性相，包括SWSSB相和混合强/弱对称性保护的拓扑相。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究混合态相提供了系统方法，特别适用于复杂对称性情况。

Abstract: We develop a general framework for studying phases of mixed states with
strong and weak symmetries, including non-invertible or categorical symmetries.
The central idea is to consider a purification of the mixed state density
matrix, which lives in a doubled Hilbert space. We propose a systematic
classification of phases in this doubled Hilbert space, relying crucially on
the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach. This framework applies
not only to group symmetries but also, importantly, to non-invertible
symmetries. We illustrate the approach in 1+1d to classify phases with strong
(non-)invertible symmetries, which include strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry
breaking (SWSSB) phases and mixed strong/weak symmetry-protected topological
phases (SPTs). We also develop an approach for studying symmetries that involve
a combination of strong and weak symmetries. A noteworthy example of this has
weak non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry and strong $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry. The continuum description is complemented by a lattice model analysis
informed by the SymTFT framework.

### [3] [Unified Framework for Quantum Code Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05361)
*Andrew C. Yuan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于同调代数的统一框架，用于确保修改后的CSS码与原码保持逻辑量子位的同构关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机包括将高维量子低密度奇偶校验码嵌入有限维欧几里得空间，或降低任意CSS码的权重。

Method: 使用同调代数语言，提供了一个统一框架，确保输出与输入码之间存在自然同构。

Result: 明确了修改CSS码时保持逻辑量子位同构的条件，并将先前工作纳入该框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为CSS码的修改提供了理论保障，并统一了现有研究成果。

Abstract: Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to
modify the stabilizer code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and
parity checks. Motivations may include embedding a high-dimensional quantum
low-density parity check (LDPC) code into finite-dimensional Euclidean space,
or reducing the weights of an arbitrary CSS code. During this embedding, it is
essential that the modified CSS code possesses an isomorphic set of logical
qubits as the original CSS code. However, despite numerous explicit
constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known
in general. Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a
unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and
input codes. In particular, we explicitly show how previous works fit into our
framework.

Result: 发现QFI的长时间平均值在相变点发生突变，并展现出跨系统的普遍行为。

Conclusion: QFI的长时间平均值可作为诊断DQPTs的有效工具，且其行为具有普遍性。

Abstract: We investigate dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in quantum systems
that possess well-defined classical limits, focusing on the spinor
Bose-Einstein condensate and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. We diagnose the
DQPTs with the long-time average of the quantum Fisher information (QFI)
showing that it abruptly changes at the transition point. Using mean-field and
semiclassical approximations, we demonstrate that the long-time average of the
QFI reveals universal behavior that persists across different systems.

### [5] [Simultaneous Determination of Local Magnetic Fields and Sensor Orientation with Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Nanodiamond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05366)

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds have emerged as a promising
quantum sensing platform for biomedical imaging applications, yet random
orientations of individual particles present significant challenges in
large-scale sensor calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach
to simultaneously determine each particle's crystallographic axes and the
surrounding local vector magnetic field. Specifically, a minimum of four
distinct bias fields is required to unambiguously extract both the orientation
and the local field. We validate our method experimentally using NV centers in
two scenarios: (1) in a bulk diamond with known crystal orientation as a proof
of concept, and (2) on various single nanodiamonds to mimic real-world
applications. Our work represents a crucial step towards unlocking the full
potential of nanodiamonds for advanced applications such as in-situ biomedical
imaging and nanoscale sensing in complex environments.

### [6] [Solving Large-Scale Vehicle Routing Problems with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05373)
*Andrew Maciejunes,John Stenger,Dan Gunlycke,Nikos Chrisochoides*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种两级分解策略，利用量子近似优化算法解决车辆路径问题（VRP），显著降低电路深度、量子比特数和双量子门数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统量子模拟器难以处理的复杂VRP问题，探索量子计算的潜在实用性。

Method: 采用问题级分解将VRP划分为更小的旅行商问题（TSP），再通过电路级分解进一步切割，以适应近期量子设备。

Result: 电路深度减少95%，量子比特数减少96%，双量子门数减少99.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了量子计算在解决复杂VRP问题上的可行性，为量子实用性提供了早期证据。

Abstract: We present a two-level decomposition strategy for solving the Vehicle Routing
Problem (VRP) using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. A
Problem-Level Decomposition partitions a 13-node (156-qubit) VRP into smaller
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances. Each TSP is then further cut via
Circuit-Level Decomposition, enabling execution on near-term quantum devices.
Our approach achieves up to 95\% reductions in the circuit depth, 96\%
reduction in the number of qubits and a 99.5\% reduction in the number of
2-qubit gates. We demonstrate this hybrid algorithm on the standard edge
encoding of the VRP as well as a novel amplitude encoding. These results
demonstrate the feasibility of solving VRPs previously too complex for quantum
simulators and provide early evidence of potential quantum utility.

Motivation: 探索巨型原子（非局域耦合的波导人工原子）在光与物质控制中的新应用，特别是在微波光子量子计算设备中的潜力。

Method: 通过非局域耦合的超导量子比特（transmon）阵列，结合方向依赖性耦合和分子结合强度，设计被动光子控制门。

Result: 实现了条件弹性相位偏移，分析了实现最大π相位偏移的条件，并评估了门保真度与实验参数的关系。

Conclusion: 巨型原子可作为微波光子量子计算设备的关键元件，为量子计算提供了新的实现途径。

Abstract: Artificial atoms non-locally coupled to waveguides -- the so-called giant
atoms -- offer new opportunities for the control of light and matter. In this
work, we show how to use an array of non-locally coupled transmon "molecules"
to engineer a passive photonic controlled gate for waveguide photons. In
particular, we show that a conditional elastic phase shift between
counter-propagating photons arises from the interplay between
direction-dependent couplings, engineered through an interplay of non local
interactions and molecular binding strength; and the nonlinearity of the
transmon array. We analyze the conditions under which a maximal $\pi$-phase
shift -- and hence a CZ gate -- is obtained, and characterize the gate fidelity
as a function of key experimental parameters, including finite transmon
nonlinearities, emitter spectral inhomogeneities, and limited cooperativity.
Our work opens the use of giant atoms as key elements of microwave photonic
quantum computing devices.

### [8] [Probing Defects with Quantum Simulator Snapshots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05379)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种利用量子模拟器中的快照数据探测缺陷物理的简单协议，无需显式引入缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快照通常用于探测局部物理，但如何利用这些数据研究缺陷物理尚不明确。

Method: 基于体系统的快照数据，提出协议提取缺陷熵并访问缺陷共形场理论的固定点线。

Result: 成功从1d Rydberg原子实现中提取缺陷熵，并访问了缺陷共形场理论的固定点线。

Conclusion: 该协议为利用快照数据研究缺陷物理提供了新途径。

Abstract: Snapshots, i.e. projective measurements of local degrees of freedom, are the
most standard data taken in experiments on quantum simulators. Snapshots are
usually used to probe local physics. In this work we propose a simple protocol
to experimentally probe physics of defects with these snapshots. Our protocol
relies only on snapshots from the bulk system, without introducing the defect
explicitly; as such, the physics of different kinds of defects can be probed
using the same dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that with snapshots of
local spin configurations of, for example, the $1d$ Rydberg atom realization of
the quantum Ising criticality, we can (1) extract the ``defect entropy", and
(2) access the continuous line of fixed points of effective defect conformal
field theory, which was recently discussed in the context of the
``weak-measurement altered criticality".

### [9] [Asymptotically Good Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05392)

Conclusion: 该构造改进了先前工作，支持更高效率和性能的量子纠错。

Abstract: Constructing quantum codes with good parameters and useful transversal gates
is a central problem in quantum error correction. In this paper, we continue
our work in arXiv:2502.01864 and construct the first family of asymptotically
good quantum codes (over qubits) supporting transversally addressable
non-Clifford gates. More precisely, given any three logical qubits across one,
two, or three codeblocks, the logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate can be executed on
those three logical qubits via a depth-one physical circuit of $\mathsf{CCZ}$
gates. This construction is based on the transitive, iso-orthogonal algebraic
geometry codes constructed by Stichtenoth (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2006). This
improves upon our construction from arXiv:2502.01864, which also supports
transversally addressable $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates and has inverse-polylogarithmic
rate and relative distance.

Result: 空间曲率显著影响Mandel参数、熵和Wigner分布函数的行为。

Conclusion: 空间曲率在调控量子系统的非经典性质中起关键作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of spatial curvature on the
Jaynes-Cummings model. We employ an analog model of general relativity,
representing the field inside a cavity using oscillators arranged in a circle
instead of a straight line, where increasing curvature corresponds to a smaller
circle radius. We investigate the nonclassical features of this quantum system
arising from the interaction between a two-level atom and a deformed harmonic
oscillator on a circle, which serves as curved-space counterpart to the flat
oscillator. We analyze the time evolution of atom-field states and, based on
this dynamic, examine how spatial curvature influences the Mandel parameter,
entropy, and the behavior of the Wigner distribution function. Our results
demonstrate that the spatial curvature plays critical roles in controlling
these nonclassical properties.

### [11] [Accessible Quantum Gates on Classical Stabilizer Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05408)
*Victor Barizien,Hugo Jacinto,Nicolas Sangouard*

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物理量子比特展现出强噪声偏置，研究如何在针对单一主导错误类型的纠错码上高效实现量子门操作变得尤为重要。

Method: 通过分析$[n,k,d]$-经典稳定子码（针对比特翻转错误），证明了实现通用逻辑门集所需的操作必须通过复杂酉电路实现，并提出了具体的实现约束条件。

Result: 结果表明，实现通用逻辑门集的电路需要满足特定层数或操作数的约束条件，这些条件同样适用于针对相位翻转错误的经典码和量子稳定子码。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在偏置噪声稳定子码框架下，探索替代逻辑门构造方法（如魔法态蒸馏和培养）的重要性。

Abstract: With the advent of physical qubits exhibiting strong noise bias, it becomes
increasingly relevant to identify which quantum gates can be efficiently
implemented on error-correcting codes designed to address a single dominant
error type. Here, we consider $[n,k,d]$-classical stabilizer codes addressing
bit-flip errors where $n$, $k$ and $d$ are the numbers of physical and logical
qubits, and the code distance respectively. We prove that operations essential
for achieving a universal logical gate set necessarily require complex unitary
circuits to be implemented. Specifically, these implementation circuits either
consists of $h$ layers of $r$-transversal operations on $c$ codeblocks such
that $c^{h-1}r^h \geq d$ or of $h$ gates, each operating on at most $r$
physical qubits on the same codeblock, such that $hr\geq d$. Similar
constraints apply not only to classical codes designed to correct phase-flip
errors, but also to quantum stabilizer codes tailored to biased noise. This
motivates a closer examination of alternative logical gate constructions using
eg.~magic state distillation and cultivation within the framework of
biased-noise stabilizer codes.

### [12] [An order-theoretic circuit syntax and characterisation of the concept lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05428)

Conclusion: 通过序论方法揭示了电路语法与形式概念分析的深层联系，为量子因果性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We take an order-theoretic approach to circuit (string diagram) syntax,
treating a circuit as a partial order with additional input-output structure.
We define morphisms between circuits and prove a factorisation theorem showing
that these can, in the finite case, be regarded as formalising a notion of
syntactical circuit rewrites, with quotient maps in particular corresponding to
gate composition. We then consider the connectivity of a circuit, expressed as
a binary relation between its inputs and outputs, and characterise the concept
lattice from formal concept analysis as the unique smallest circuit that admits
morphisms from all other circuits with the same connectivity. This has
significance for quantum causality, particularly to the study of causal
decompositions of unitary transformations. We close by constructing the circuit
characterised by the dual statement.

Result: 观察到光机械诱导透明（OMIT）、磁机械诱导透明（MMIT）和磁子诱导透明（MIT），并发现Fano共振现象。

Conclusion: 研究结果为量子信息处理技术的开发提供了新的理论视角和潜在应用方向。

Abstract: This study presents a theoretical investigation of magnomechanically induced
transparency, Fano resonance, and slow/fast light phenomena within a hybrid
optomagnomechanical system. The system consists of a mechanical membrane within
a cavity and a ferrimagnetic crystal with a magnon squeezing mode that couples
directly to a microwave cavity mode through magnetic dipole interaction and
indirectly to an optical cavity through the crystal's deformation displacement.
The optical cavity is influenced by the mechanical displacement, which is
driven by magnetostrictive forces through radiation pressure. The interactions
among photon, phonons, magnons, and microwave within the cavity give rise to
optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), magnomechanically induced
transparency (MMIT) and magnon-induced transparency (MIT). We analyze how the
presence of magnon squeezing modifies the absorption and dispersion properties
of the optical spectrum. Additionally, the emergence of Fano resonance via
photon-phonon coupling in the presence of the magnon squeezing is examined. By
tuning the microwave-magnon interactions and the magnon squeezing parameters,
we enhance slow/light effects. Our results aim to contribute to the development
of quantum information processing technologies.

*Asgar Hosseinnezhad,Hadi Sabri*

Main category: quant-ph

Result: 协议在异步纠缠分发和多路径场景下仍保证量子前向安全性和端到端完整性，仿真验证了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该架构为完全用物理量子态替代经典认证的量子通信系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Current quantum communication protocols rely heavily on classical
authentication for message origin verification, leaving them vulnerable to
evolving attacks that exploit classical trust assumptions. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for secure quantum relay networks that completely
avoids classical authentication. Instead, we leverage pre-distributed
entanglement graphs and non-classical correlation-assisted decoding to enable
exclusive message retrieval by designated nodes without broadcasting any key or
handshake. The system routes messages across multiple relay nodes, yet ensures
that no intermediate node can access the message unless it possesses the
entangled state partner. We demonstrate that even in multi-path scenarios with
asynchronous entanglement distribution, the protocol guarantees quantum-forward
secrecy and end-to-end origin integrity without trusted intermediaries.
Simulation results confirm both functionality and robustness under entanglement
loss and imperfect detection. This architecture paves the way for scalable
quantum communication systems where physical quantum states replace classical
authentication mechanisms entirely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子协议依赖显式传输解密密钥或相位参数，易受窃听攻击，需要更安全的解决方案。

Result: 系统在动态屏蔽和传输噪声下保持94%以上的量子相干性和0.86的纠缠负性，抗窃听能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 该架构适用于大规模安全量子网络，能有效防御经典和量子威胁。

Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid cryptographic framework for quantum
communication that integrates entanglement-assisted decryption with phase-based
physical obfuscation. While conventional quantum protocols often rely on
explicit transmission of decryption keys or phase parameters, such models
expose critical vulnerabilities to eavesdropping. To address this challenge, we
propose a two-stage encryption-decryption mechanism. The first stage employs
randomized phase modulation protected by active electromagnetic shielding to
conceal the quantum signal from unauthorized interception. The second stage
enables legitimate receivers to retrieve encrypted phase data using entangled
quantum states, eliminating the need for classical key transfer. A formal
mathematical framework is developed to describe the two-stage encoding and
decryption process, including phase-modulated entangled states and their
transformation under nonlocal correlation and adversarial noise. Simulation
metrics confirm that the hybrid system preserves quantum coherence with
visibility above 94% and entanglement negativity of 0.86, even under dynamic
shielding and transmission noise. Simulation results demonstrate that the
combined protocol enhances anti-eavesdropping resilience while maintaining
quantum coherence. This architecture is suitable for large-scale secure quantum
networks, where multi-layered defense strategies are essential against
classical and quantum threats.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对非厄米局域化和临界行为的理解，为合成量子系统中可调边缘局域态提供了新思路。

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems possess exotic localization phenomena beyond their
Hermitian counterparts, exhibiting massive accumulation of eigenstates at the
system boundaries with different scaling behaviors. In this study, we
investigate two weakly coupled non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson chains under
M\"obius boundary conditions (MBCs), and reveal the coexistence of two distinct
localization behaviors for eigenstates. Namely, eigenstates exhibit
non-Hermitian skin effect in one chain and scale-free localization in the
other. Notably, the localization characteristics of eigenstates can exchange
between the two chains depending on their eigenenergies. This phenomenon is
found to emerge from the critical behaviors induced by the weak interchain
coupling, which can even be enhanced by MBCs in comparison \red{to} the system
under other boundary conditions. Our findings deepen the understanding of
non-Hermitian localization and criticality, and offer new insights into
engineering tunable edge-localized states in synthetic quantum systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的噪声鲁棒性纠缠分类方法，通过支持向量机（SVM）优化参数，显著提升了在测量噪声下的分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子测量存在固有噪声，影响纠缠检测的可靠性并限制量子技术的可扩展性，传统纠错方法资源开销大。

Method: 利用SVM从Pauli测量中提取特征，开发了一种鲁棒最优纠缠见证（ROEW），通过优化SVM参数以应对最坏情况误差。

Abstract: Quantum measurements are inherently noisy, hindering reliable entanglement
detection and limiting the scalability of quantum technologies. While error
mitigation and correction strategies exist, they often impose prohibitive
resource overheads. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to
achieve noise-resilient entanglement classification even with imperfect
measurements. Using support vector machines (SVMs) trained on features
extracted from Pauli measurements, we develop a robust optimal entanglement
witness (ROEW) that remains effective under unknown measurement noise. By

Conclusion: 研究揭示了强耦合JC模型中波粒二象性的非经典特性，为量子光学中的波粒行为提供了新见解。

Abstract: We operationally uncover aspects of wave/particle duality for the open driven
Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model in its strong-coupling limit. We lay special
emphasis on the vacuum Rabi resonance, and determine the corresponding
normalized intensity-field correlation function via mapping to ordinary
resonance fluorescence. We demonstrate that temporal wave-particle fluctuations
of light emanating from an established vacuum Rabi resonance are explicitly
non-classical, while the limit of vanishing spontaneous emission restores
detailed balance. When photon blockade sets in, individual realizations show a
rapidly increasing frequency of fluctuations towards the two-photon resonance,
arising as a direct consequence of a resolved JC spectrum. About the two-photon
resonance peak, spontaneous emissions are more likely to revive a
high-frequency quantum beat in the conditioned electromagnetic field amplitude
than photons escaping out of the cavity mode. The beat originates from a
coherent superposition of the first excited JC couplet states, and sets the
background against which nonclassical phase shifts are observed in the
conditioned quadrature amplitudes. We also find that the onset of steady-state
bimodality reduces the variation of the normalized intensity-field correlation,
at the expense of its temporal symmetry.

Abstract: Electron--molecule collisions play a central role in both natural processes
and modern technological applications, particularly in plasma processing.
Conventional computational strategies such as the R-matrix method have been
widely adopted yet encounter significant scaling challenges in treating more
complex systems. In this work we present a quantum computational approach that
utilises the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and variations thereof to
overcome these limitations. We explore a number of methods, including the use
of number projection operators and simultaneous optimisation. We demonstrate
the feasibility of our method on a model problem of electron scattering from
the hydrogen molecule. We recover the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian within a
chosen symmetry sector. Moreover, the optimal circuit parameters directly
encode the R-matrix boundary amplitudes needed for subsequent scattering
computations.

Abstract: Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum
information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of
light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and
matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating)
processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created
or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between
light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for
noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum
technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant
interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium
superradiant phase transitions.Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting
of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving
ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective
magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term.
We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz
- direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative
enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of
remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform
facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant
interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling
noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.

Conclusion: 李子代数工程为解决梯度消失问题提供了可扩展且实用的方法，适用于近期量子处理器。

Abstract: We propose SUN-VQC, a variational-circuit architecture whose elementary
layers are single exponentials of a symmetry-restricted Lie subgroup,
$\mathrm{SU}(2^{k}) \subset \mathrm{SU}(2^{n})$ with $k \ll n$. Confining the
evolution to this compact subspace reduces the dynamical Lie-algebra dimension
from $\mathcal{O}(4^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(4^{k})$, ensuring only polynomial
suppression of gradient variance and circumventing barren plateaus that plague
hardware-efficient ans\"atze. Exact, hardware-compatible gradients are obtained
using a generalized parameter-shift rule, avoiding ancillary qubits and
finite-difference bias. Numerical experiments on quantum auto-encoding and
classification show that SUN-VQCs sustain order-of-magnitude larger gradient
signals, converge 2--3$\times$ faster, and reach higher final fidelities than
depth-matched Pauli-rotation or hardware-efficient circuits. These results
demonstrate that Lie-subalgebra engineering provides a principled, scalable
route to barren-plateau-resilient VQAs compatible with near-term quantum
processors.

Abstract: We present a scalable framework for accurately modeling many-body
interactions in surface-code quantum processor units (QPUs). Combining a
concise diagrammatic formalism with high-precision numerical methods, our
approach efficiently evaluates high-order, long-range Pauli string couplings
and maps complete chip layouts onto exact effective Hamiltonians. Applying this
method to surface-code architectures, such as Google's Sycamore lattice, we
identify three distinct operational regimes: computationally stable,
error-dominated, and hierarchy-inverted. Our analysis reveals that even modest
increases in residual qubit-qubit crosstalk can invert the interaction
hierarchy, driving the system from a computationally favorable phase into a
topologically ordered regime. This framework thus serves as a powerful guide
for optimizing next-generation high-fidelity surface-code hardware and provides
a pathway to investigate emergent quantum many-body phenomena.

Abstract: Photon counting is a fundamental component in quantum optics and quantum
information. However, implementing ideal photon-number-resolving (PNR)
detectors remains experimentally challenging. Multiplexed PNR detection offers
a scalable and practical alternative by distributing photons across multiple
modes and detecting their presence using simple ON-OFF detectors, thereby
enabling approximate photon-number resolution. In this work, we establish a
theoretical model for such detectors and prove that the estimation error in
terms of photon number moments decreases inverse proportionally to the number
of detectors. Thanks to the enhanced PNR capability, multiplexed PNR detector
provides an advantage in cat-state breeding protocols. Assuming a two-photon
subtraction case, 7dB of squeezing, and an array of 20 detectors of efficiency
95%, our calculation predicts fidelity ~ 0.88 with a success probability ~
3.8%, representing orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous works. Similar
enhancement also extends to cat-state generation with the generalized photon
number subtraction. With experimentally feasible parameters, our results
suggest that megahertz-rate cat-state generation is achievable using an on-chip
array of tens of ON-OFF detectors.

Conclusion: 该方法为极化子问题提供了新的解决方案，并为未来方法开发提供了基准。

Abstract: The polaron problem is a very old problem in condensed matter physics that
dates back to the thirties, but still remain largely unsolved today, especially
when electron-electron interaction is taken into consideration. The presence of
both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the problem
invalidates most existing numerical methods, either computationally too
expensive or simply intractable. The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo
(CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the
imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network
and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the
electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon
influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath
discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and
the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve
several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii)
measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions.
We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive
numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC.
We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done
before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future
method developments.

Abstract: Time-continuous quantum measurement allows for the tracking of a quantum
system in real time via sequences of short, and individually weak, measurement
intervals. Such measurements are necessarily invasive, imparting backaction to
the system, and allowing the observer to update their state estimate based on
stochastic measurement outcomes. Feedback control then involves real-time
interventions by an observer, conditioned on the time-continuous measurement
signal that they receive. We here consider diffusive quantum trajectories, and
focus on the "noise-canceling" subset of feedback protocols that aim to
minimize the degree of stochasticity in the dynamics. We derive such a class of
feedback operations, showing that under the idealized assumptions of pure
states, unit measurement efficiency, and zero time-delay in implementing
feedback operations, perfectly noise-canceling feedback always exists. We
consider the resulting noise-canceled dynamics generated by an effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian; while non-Hermitian Hamiltonians from continuous
monitoring generally describe rare dynamics (accessible by costly
post-selection), the use of noise-canceling feedback here leads to
non-Hermitian dynamics that occur deterministically. We demonstrate this via
examples of entangled state preparation and stabilization. We then illustrate
the potential for the application of noise-cancellation to boost success rates
in magic state distillation protocols. We show that adding feedback based on
noise-cancellation into a time-continuous 5-to-1 distillation protocol leads to
higher probabilities of successful distillation across a range of input errors,
and extends the threshold on input errors for which the protocol is effective.
Our results highlight the efficacy of noise-canceling feedback-aided protocols
for quantum state preparation and stabilization tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be
considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The
circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit
connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator.
Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph
can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined
from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields
an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These
types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for
approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev
polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional
probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph
signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a
very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an
$N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential
compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the
output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the
circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based
approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets
listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the
quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a
generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases
better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when
geometric structure plays a significant role.

Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $n$ (denoted as QLS$(n)$) is an $n\times n$
array whose entries are unit column vectors from the $n$-dimensional Hilbert
space $\mathcal{H}_n$, such that each row and column forms an orthonormal
basis. Two unit vectors $|u\rangle, |v\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_n$ are regarded as
identical if there exists a real number $\theta$ such that
$|u\rangle=e^{i\theta}|v\rangle$; otherwise, they are considered distinct. The
cardinality $c$ of a QLS$(n)$ is the number of distinct vectors in the array.
In this paper, we use sub-QLS$(4)$s to prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$ and
any integer $c\in [4m,16m^2]\setminus \{4m+1\}$, there is a QLS$(4m)$ with
cardinality $c$.

Abstract: The multimode cavity optomechanical system offers versatile applications
including state transduction, coherent interconnection, and many-body
simulations. In this study, we developed a cavity electromechanical system that
integrates a 3C-SiC membrane and a rectangular superconducting cavity to
observe the generation of nearly degenerate pairs of mechanical modes.
Subsequently, we derive the expression for intrinsic frequency under nonuniform
stress and find that this method supports a remarkably resolution for stress
analysis in thin films. Experimentally, we perform collective fitting on the
measured set of 57 mechanical modes, revealing deviations in biaxial
non-uniform stress on the order of MPa. These degeneracy-broken mechanical
modes exhibit exceptional quality factors as high as $10^8$ in a thermal bath
of 10 mK. Furthermore, Allan deviation indicates that these modes exhibit
extremely stable frequencies compared with different types of optomechanical
devices. We then performed state-swapping between near-degenerate mode pairs,
demonstrating the transfer efficiency exceeding 78\%, attributed to their
exceptionally long lifetimes. This study paves the way for the design of
compact quantum phononic devices featuring high-quality-factor mechanical
multimode.

Abstract: The fundamental goal of information theory is to characterize complex
operational tasks using efficiently computable information quantities,
Shannon's capacity formula being the prime example of this. However, many tasks
in quantum information can only be characterized by regularized entropic
measures that are often not known to be computable and for which efficient
approximations are scarce. It is thus of fundamental importance to understand
when regularization is not needed, opening the door to an efficiently
computable characterization based on additive quantities. Here, we demonstrate
that for a large class of problems, the question of whether regularization is
needed or not can be determined at the single-copy level. Specifically, we
demonstrate that regularization of the Umegaki relative entropy, along with
related quantities such as the Petz and sandwiched relative entropies, is not
needed if and only if a single-copy optimizer satisfies a certain property.
These problems include hypothesis testing with arbitrarily varying hypotheses
as well as quantum resource theories used to derive fundamental bounds for
entanglement and magic state distillation. We derive the Stein, Chernoff, and
Hoeffding exponents for these problems and establish necessary and sufficient
conditions for their additivity, while also presenting partial results for the
strong converse exponent.

Abstract: Thermal engines have been one of the principal topics of thermodynamics ever
since its beginning. Today, in the era of the second quantum revolution,
although the thermal processes in constant temperatures are relatively well
understood in the language of resource theories, a framework to describe
thermal engines is still in its infancy. In this work we formalize the resource
theory of engines, initially put forward in [Quantum 8, 1222], and define such
quantities as engine efficiency. Then, we turn to a detailed study of thermal
engines based on free operations arising from the resource theory of
athermality under different restrictions: thermal operation, semilocal thermal
operations and local thermal operation with classical communication. In order
to provide analytic lower bounds for thermal engine operation we construct
tree-states -- free states, which can be obtained from Gibbs state in simple
protocol consisting solely of two-level operations. Furthermore, we derive a
full description of the engine based on semilocal thermal operations describing
e.g. free states, faithful monotones and catalytic advantages.

Abstract: Ergodicity, the property that all allowed configurations are explored over
time, plays a pivotal role in explaining the equilibrium behavior of classical
dynamical systems. Yet, such a property is typically precluded in quantum
systems owing to the presence of energy eigenstates, which are stationary
states in dynamics. However, recent theoretical works have argued that ergodic
explorations of the Hilbert space, occurring at varying levels as measured by
statistical pseudorandomness of the time-evolved quantum states, may be
exhibited for quantum systems driven by Hamiltonians with aperiodic time
dependencies, which do not face such obstacles. Here, we experimentally
investigate the hierarchy of Hilbert-space ergodicities (HSE) achievable in the
dynamics of a single quantum spin realized by a solid-state defect in diamond,
upon subjecting it to various time-dependent modulations. Through continuous
monitoring of spin trajectories with full state tomography, different degrees
of HSE were observed, ranging from no HSE in a time-periodic (Floquet) drive,
to partial HSE in a smoothly kicked time-quasiperiodic drive, to complete HSE
in a drive composed of a sequence of kicks generated by the Fibonacci word. We
formulate a theoretical understanding of the increasing levels of HSE observed
by attributing them to increasing levels of complexities associated with the
drive sequences, whose notions we elucidate. Our work constitutes the first
unambiguous experimental evidence of Hilbert space ergodicity and promotes
deeper investigations into the mechanisms and fine-grained levels with which
closed quantum systems reach equilibrium.

Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of squeezed lasing in a
reservoir-engineered optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO provides a
basis of squeezed states and parametric amplification in lasing emission, whose
vacuum reservoir is coupled to a squeezed vacuum generated by a second OPO.
With a precisely controlled squeezing angle and strong squeezing injection, the
parametric interaction in the first OPO is exponentially enhanced. It
successfully circumvents the decoherence in the system, and eliminates the
undesired noise of spontaneous photon emission in the OPO. As a result, the
amplified parametric process simultaneously reserves the coherence and quantum
properties in the first OPO, and yields a -6.1 dB squeezed laser in optical
domain with a narrow linewidth and high brightness. Our work sheds light on
potential applications of squeezed lasing in quantum metrology and quantum
optics.

Abstract: Time-reversal of unitary evolution is fundamental in quantum information
processing. Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and
metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In
this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task:
approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown
$d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound
$\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm
error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent
protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an
average-case distance error. Moreover, our result implies a query lower bound
$\Omega(d^2)$ for approximately implementing control-$U$ up to an irrelevant
phase, which is also tight with respect to the dimension.

Conclusion: 非纯态变换是自然的，且在热态的时间与温度连接中有实际应用。

Abstract: We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical
or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have
sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states
in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that
the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a
semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be
either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in
particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference
frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure
transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time
and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.

Abstract: Quantum state discrimination is a fundamental concept in quantum information
theory, which refers to a class of techniques to identify a specific quantum
state through a positive operator-valued measure. In this work, we investigate
how structural information about either the quantum states or the measurement
operators can influence our ability to determine or bound the optimal
discrimination probability. First, we observe that for single-qubit states,
pairwise fidelities are sufficient to completely characterize the optimal
discrimination. In contrast, for multi-qubit states, this correspondence breaks
down. Motivated by this, we analytically derive the optimal discrimination
probability for three equiprobable single-qubit states with equal pairwise
fidelities in terms of fidelity. Secondly, we consider partial information
about the optimal measurement, specifically the measurement operators that
vanish in the optimal solution. We show that such information can be leveraged
to tighten existing upper bounds on the optimal discrimination probability.
Lastly, we show that in some cases, subsets and supersets of nonvanishing
operators can be identified without semidefinite programming.

Abstract: Noise fundamentally limits the performance of quantum systems by degrading
coherence and reducing control fidelity. Characterizing this noise is essential
for improving measurement accuracy, understanding environmental interactions,
and designing effective control strategies. However, extracting its spectral
characteristics and associated dephasing times from limited experimental data
remains a key challenge.
  Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on Dynamical Mode
Decomposition (DMD) to analyze the dynamics of quantum systems under stochastic
noise. We reinterpret DMD modes as statistical weights over an ensemble of
quantum trajectories and use this mapping to construct a noise power spectral
density (PSD) via a nonlinear transformation. This enables identification of
dominant frequency contributions in both white and $1/f$ noise environments and
directly yields the pure dephasing time $T_2^*$ from DMD eigenvalues. To
overcome instability in standard DMD reconstruction, we develop a constrained
extrapolation scheme using the extracted $T_2^*$ as a physical bound and the
learned PSD as mode weights. We demonstrate our method on simulated Ramsey-type
dynamics and validate its ability to recover spectral features and coherence
decay. This approach offers a robust, data-driven tool for diagnostic and
predictive noise analysis in quantum systems.

Conclusion: 改进的理论模型为研究量子摩擦和Rydberg原子光谱提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Selective reflection is a high-resolution spectroscopic method that allows
the probing of atomic and molecular gases in the near field of dielectric cell
windows. It is a sensitive technique for measuring interactions between excited
atoms and surfaces, thus providing a unique tool to probe resonant effects in
Casimir-Polder physics. The theoretical modelling of selective reflection
spectra has thus far employed the infinite Doppler approximation which assumes
that the Doppler shift dominates over the atom-surface interactions as well as
the homogeneous transition linewidth. Here we extend the theoretical treatment
of selective reflection spectra to include the effects of finite Doppler width.
This allows us to analyse the regime of very large Casimir-Polder interactions,
relevant for Rydberg atom spectroscopy, and revisit previous analyses of
experiments with low-lying excited states. Further, this will aid in
determining the signatures of quantum friction in vapor cell spectroscopy.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement offers a powerful framework for understanding the
complex collective phenomena in quantum many-body systems that are often beyond
the description of conventional bipartite entanglement measures. Here, we
propose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the
matrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the
optimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are
defined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs
with specified virtual bond dimensions $\chi$, and thus are dubbed as
$\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\chi$-MPE). We demonstrate
superlinear, linear, and sublinear scaling behaviors of $\chi$-MPE with respect
to the negative logarithmic fidelity $F$ in state preparation, which correspond
to excessive, optimal, and insufficient circuit depth $D$ for preparing
$\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs, respectively. Specifically, a linearly-growing
$\chi$-MPE with $F$ suggests $\mathcal{H}_{\chi} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{D}$, where
$\mathcal{H}_{\chi}$ denotes the manifold of the $\chi$-virtual-dimensional
MPSs and $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ denotes that of the states accessible by the $D$
layer circuits. We provide an exact proof that $\mathcal{H}_{\chi=2} \equiv
\mathcal{H}_{D=1}$. Our results establish tensor networks as a powerful and
general tool for developing parametrized measures of multipartite entanglement.
The matrix product form adopted in $\chi$-MPE can be readily extended to other
tensor network ans\"atze, whose scaling behaviors are expected to assess the
optimality of quantum circuit in preparing the corresponding tensor network
states.

Abstract: The most appealing features of chip-scale quantum sensors are their
capability to maintain extreme sensitivity while enabling large-scale batch
manufacturing. This necessitates high-level integration and wafer-level
fabrication of atomic vapor cells. In this paper, we describe a micromachining
paradigm for wafer-level atomic vapor cells functionalized by CMOS-compatible
non-magnetic heaters and temperature sensors and demonstrate several innovative
applications. Leveraging standard micro-nanofabrication technology, the
integrated vapor cells achieved an ultra-long optical access of 5 mm, nearly
four time that of previously microfabricated vapor cells. The feasibility of
the integrated atomic vapor cells fabrication process was verified by a
consecutive 30-day aging test in a harsh environment (operating temperature of
473 K and vacuum of approximately 1 Pa). Benefiting from the ultra-long optical
path, we observed several typical quantum effects, including the saturation
absorption and spin fluctuations, a regime previously inaccessible with
conventional micromachined vapor cells. Finally, a zero-field quantum
magnetometry with an ultra-high magnetic sensitivity of 12 fT/Hz1/2 was also
demonstrated. Our achievements broaden the potential applications of
microfabricated atomic vapor cells and pave the way for scalable manufacturing
of ultrasensitive, chip-scale quantum sensors.

Abstract: We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a
hypothesis state $\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\rho$, a
tester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\epsilon$-far in
trace distance. It is known that $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are
necessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled
measurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for
a worst-case $\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is
for this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal
bounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the
tester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],
they remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements
they can perform.
  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for
quantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled
measurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal
copy complexity for certifying $\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity
times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our
lower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method,
which is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to
recover the $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15],
i.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple
proof.

Abstract: Interferometry can be viewed generally as the measurement of a relative phase
between two subsystems. I consider the problem of interfering a quantum
resource state with a thermal bath, drawing a precise connection between the
athermality of the resource and the resulting phase sensitivity. This is done
by finding the fundamental sensing precision limit under the minimal conditions
of global unitarity and energy conservation. The results here apply both to
general finite-dimensional systems and to linear quantum optics. The same
techniques further upper-bound the speed at which a system and bath can jointly
evolve under an energy-conserving interaction.

Abstract: We present the mathematical model and numerical calculation results for the
tunneling of the wave function in a time-periodic double-well potential. The
bi-quadratic potential of a double-well form is used. Based on a mathematical
model of the time evolution of the wave function, a numerical algorithm has
been developed and a program has been created for solving the Schr\"odinger
equation, which describes the time evolution of the particle's wave function.
As a result of numerical modeling, modulation regimes have been obtained at
which tunneling took place. In a stationary double well potential, no tunneling
was observed. On the contrary, in the time periodic potential, tunneling was
observed, the rate of which depended on the modulation frequency. Adjusting the
modulation parameters, it is possible to control the particle wave function
tunneling rate.

Abstract: Temporal correlations are fundamental in quantum physics, yet their
computation is often challenging. The regression theorem (or hypothesis) serves
as a key tool in this context, offering a seemingly straightforward approach.
However, it fails for systems strongly coupled to their surroundings, where
memory effects become significant. Here, we extend the analysis of temporal
correlations beyond the regression theorem, revealing what can be learned about
open quantum systems when this hypothesis fails. We introduce robust,
operationally meaningful methods to explore how the breakdown of the regression
hypothesis can uncover fundamental quantum features of non-Markovian open
systems, including entanglement, coherence, and quantum memory, namely, the
fundamental impossibility of simulating memory in non-Markov processes with
classical feedback mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate how these quantum
features are linked to microscopic properties such as the bath spectral density
and heat flow.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子不常见信息的近似计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: In classical information theory, uncommon information refers to the amount of
information that is not shared between two messages, and it admits an
operational interpretation as the minimum communication cost required to
exchange the messages. Extending this notion to the quantum setting, quantum
uncommon information is defined as the amount of quantum information necessary
to exchange two quantum states. While the value of uncommon information can be
computed exactly in the classical case, no direct method is currently known for
calculating its quantum analogue. Prior work has primarily focused on deriving
upper and lower bounds for quantum uncommon information. In this work, we
propose a new approach for estimating these bounds by utilizing the quantum
Donsker-Varadhan representation and implementing a gradient-based optimization
method. Our results suggest a pathway toward efficient approximation of quantum
uncommon information using variational techniques grounded in quantum neural
architectures.

Motivation: 量子纠错（QEC）需要大量物理量子比特和深度电路，设计降低门和时空开销的协议对提高近实验效率至关重要。多量子比特门虽能加速稳定器测量电路，但可能引入高权重相关错误，影响电路级距离。

Result: 相比标准四$CZ$门方案，该方法更快、使用更少门且保持容错性，逻辑错误概率相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为其他QEC码（如量子低密度奇偶校验码）的容错性推广提供了可能。

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires the execution of deep quantum
circuits with large numbers of physical qubits to protect information against
errors. Designing protocols that can reduce gate and space-time overheads of
QEC is therefore crucial to enable more efficient QEC in near-term experiments.
Multiqubit gates offer a natural path towards fast and low-depth stabilizer
measurement circuits. However, they typically introduce high-weight correlated
errors that can degrade the circuit-level distance, leading to slower scalings
of the logical error probabilities. In this work, we show how to realize fast
and efficient surface code stabilizer readout using only two $CZ_2$ gates --
instead of four $CZ$ -- while preserving fault tolerance, and provide a
blueprint for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays. We derive the time-optimal
pulses implementing the gates and perform extensive QEC numerical simulations
with leakage errors. Compared to the standard protocol using four $CZ$ gates,
our scheme is faster, uses fewer gates and crucially maintains fault tolerance
with comparable logical error probabilities. Fault-tolerant generalizations of
this scheme to other QEC codes, such as quantum Low-Density Parity-Check codes,
are also discussed.

Conclusion: 这一守恒定律为量子态的几何不变量分类提供了新工具，有助于高效识别有用的量子态类。

Abstract: We establish a previously unexplored conservation law for the Quantum Fisher
Information Matrix (QFIM) expressed as follows; when the QFIM is constructed
from a set of observables closed under commutation, i.e., a Lie algebra, the
spectrum of the QFIM is invariant under unitary dynamics generated by these
same operators. Each Lie algebra therefore endows any quantum state with a
fixed "budget" of metrological sensitivity -- an intrinsic resource that we
show, like optical squeezing in interferometry, cannot be amplified by
symmetry-preserving operations. The Uhlmann curvature tensor (UCT) naturally
inherits the same symmetry group, and so quantum incompatibility is similarly
fixed. As a result, a metrological analog to Liouville's theorem appears;
statistical distances, volumes, and curvatures are invariant under the
evolution generated by the Lie algebra. We discuss this as it relates to the
quantum analogs of classical optimality criteria. This enables one to
efficiently classify useful classes of quantum states at the level of Lie

Abstract: Quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians and their associated unitary transformations
form a fundamental class of operations in quantum optics, modeling key
processes such as squeezing, displacement, and beam-splitting. Their
Heisenberg-picture dynamics simplifies to linear (or possibly affine)
transformations on quadrature operators, enabling efficient analysis and
decomposition into optical gate sets using matrix operations. However, this
formalism discards a phase, which, while often neglected, is essential for a
complete unitary characterization. We present efficient methods to recover this
phase directly from the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of the unitary, using
calculations that scale polynomially with the number of modes and avoid Fock
space manipulations. We reduce to integration the general problem, including
the case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, and provide analytical results for key
cases including when the Hamiltonian is positive definite, passive, active, or
single-mode.

*Othmane Benhayoune-Khadraoui,Cristóbal Lledó,Alexandre Blais*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Kerr-cat qubits在实验中表现出较大的噪声偏置，但超过临界驱动振幅后，隧穿时间不再增加甚至减少。研究发现这是由电路的多模特性引起的，特别是缓冲模式可能引发多光子共振，影响相干性。通过Floquet-Markov框架分析，揭示了这一机制，并展示了Kerr-cat qubit在优化电磁环境下的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现缓冲模式的多光子共振是导致隧穿时间减少的原因，优化电磁环境可提升Kerr-cat qubit的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅解释了隧穿时间减少的现象，还展示了Kerr-cat qubit在优化环境下的潜力。

Abstract: Kerr-cat qubits have been experimentally shown to exhibit a large noise bias,
with one decay channel suppressed by several orders of magnitude. In
superconducting implementations, increasing the microwave drive on the
nonlinear oscillator that hosts the Kerr-cat qubit should, in principle,
further enhance this bias. Instead, experiments reveal that above a critical
drive amplitude the tunneling time - the less dominant decay channel - ceases
to increase and even decreases. Here, we show that this breakdown arises from
the multimode nature of the circuit implementation: specifically, the buffer
mode used to control the Kerr-cat qubit can induce multiphoton resonances that
sharply degrade Kerr-cat coherence if its frequency is not carefully chosen. We
uncover this mechanism by retaining the full circuit nonlinearities and
treating the strong drive exactly within a Floquet-Markov framework that
incorporates quasidegeneracies in the Kerr-cat spectrum. Our results not only
provide an explanation for the sudden reduction of the tunneling time but also
demonstrate the robustness of the Kerr-cat qubit when its surrounding
electromagnetic environment is carefully engineered.

Result: 算法运行时间与系统规模对数相关，适用于满足稀疏和无散条件的系统。

Conclusion: 该模拟问题是BQP完全的，算法在数值实验中验证了有效性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of simulating dynamics of classical nonlinear
dissipative systems with $N\gg 1$ degrees of freedom. To make the problem
tractable for quantum computers, we add a weak Gaussian noise to the equation
of motion and the initial state. Our main result is an end-to-end quantum
algorithm for simulating the noisy dynamics of nonlinear systems satisfying
certain sparsity and divergence-free conditions. For any constant nonzero noise
rate, the quantum runtime scales polynomially with $\log{(N)}$, evolution time,
inverse error tolerance, and the relative strength of nonlinearity and
dissipation. Our main technical tool is the Kolmogorov partial differential
equation describing time evolution of scalar functions of solutions, averaged
over noise. To enable efficient quantum simulation, we project the Kolmogorov
equation onto the space of low degree polynomials and derive a rigorous upper
bound on the resulting approximation error, which may be of independent
interest. Finally, we show that the considered simulation problem is
BQP-complete, meaning that it is as hard as simulating the universal quantum
computer. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm by simulating it
numerically for two paradigmatic nonlinear systems: an anharmonic oscillator
and the 2D Navier Stokes equation.

Result: 实现了电路深度的指数级优化，辅助量子比特和随机性资源的使用也接近最优。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效，还展示了新分析框架的通用性，为量子实验中的随机酉误差分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in
circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is
exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$,
$\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to
exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla
qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n
k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count
$\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To
achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured
random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth
implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new
analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many
queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's
versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of
pseudorandom unitaries.

Result: 成功恢复了经典-量子信道的最优误差指数，并扩展了其在多种量子通信问题中的应用。

Conclusion: 本文不仅解决了长期存在的猜想，还为量子通信中的多种问题提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum
channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By
choosing the optimal input distribution, we recover the optimal error exponent
(i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above
the critical rate. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems,
including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or
without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data
compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length
coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the
directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral
representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good
measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which
provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is
pretty good.

Abstract: Oxide glasses have proven to be useful across a wide range of technological
applications. Nevertheless, their medium-range structure has remained elusive.
Previous studies focused on the ring statistics as a metric for the
medium-range structure, which, however, provides an incomplete picture of the
glassy structure. Here, we use atomistic simulations and state-of-the-art
topological analysis tools, namely persistent homology (PH), to analyze the
medium-range structure of the archetypal oxide glass (Silica) at ambient
temperatures and with varying pressures. PH presents an unbiased definition of
loops and voids, providing an advantage over other methods for studying the
structure and topology of complex materials, such as glasses, across multiple
length scales. We captured subtle topological transitions in medium-range order
and cavity distributions, providing new insights into glass structure. Our work
provides a robust way for extracting the void distribution of oxide glasses
based on persistent homology.

Result: OD与余弦相似度相关性较弱，表明其独立性；SN路径的累积OD分数显著低于最短路径，验证了SN的语义一致性。

Conclusion: OD为分析语义结构和验证导航过程提供了基于定义的新工具。

Abstract: Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from
lexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling.
While network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying
semantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains
challenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on
lexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation
jump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological
Differentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts
by analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is
applied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD
scores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature
(cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak
correlations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across
$\sim$~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50\% of the
entries in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely
independent, definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine
similarity becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed
from the dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths
generated by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP)
across networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower
cumulative OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces
trajectories more coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as
measured by OD. Ontological Differentiation thus provides a novel,
definition-grounded tool for analyzing semantic structure and validating
navigation processes in lexical networks.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of quantum vortex dipoles in a strongly
interacting, spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid at zero temperature. Using fully
microscopic time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that the
dipole trajectory is strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of spin
polarization. The resulting forces on the vortices include both longitudinal
(dissipative) and transverse components, leading to deflection and shrinking of
the dipole during propagation. For moderate polarization, vortex dipoles are
deflected and lose energy, while for larger imbalances, they are rapidly
annihilated. Our findings provide compelling evidence that spin-imbalanced
Fermi gases contain a spatially nonuniform normal component even at zero
temperature. We show that vortex dipoles serve as sensitive probes of this
component, offering a route to indirectly detect exotic superfluid phases such
as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state and related inhomogeneous
condensates.

Abstract: We explore the dynamical behavior of one-dimensional quantum droplets (QDs)
governed by the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, under harmonic confinement
supplemented by a static or time-dependent Gaussian spike (Gs) potential.
Employing both variational analytical techniques and numerical simulations, we
investigate the evolution of the root-mean-square (RMS) size, excitation
spectrum, and phase-space dynamics of QDs. Our study reveals that while the
harmonic trap sets the primary confinement, the Gs potential enables precise
frequency tuning and control over droplet oscillations. A static Gs amplitude
modifies the fundamental oscillation frequency depending on its sign, while a
time-modulated Gs induces nonlinear dynamics, including higher harmonics and
frequency mixing. Our analysis reveals that the resulting frequency spectrum is
strongly influenced by inter- and intra-species interactions as well as by the
parameters of the external trap. Notably, we establish a relationship between
the frequency shift and the amplitude of the Gaussian spike. Wigner phase-space
analysis further uncovers coherent rotational behavior, offering insights into
hidden phase dynamics not apparent in real-space density profiles.

Abstract: Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the
data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used
workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global
normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the
zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood
naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small,
patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those
of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on
uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured
datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics
(spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples
increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful
attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the
ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works
both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory
and generalization.

Abstract: The multi-wave exact resonance condition is a fundamental principle for
understanding energy transfer in condensed matter systems, yet the dynamical
evolution of waves satisfying this condition remains unexplored. Here, we
reveal that the multi-wave resonant kinetic equations possess distinctive
symmetry properties that preferentially induce energy equalization between
counter-propagating waves of identical frequency. This initial equalization
disrupts the exact resonance condition, rendering it dynamically invalid. We
further demonstrate that nonlinearity-mediated multi-wave quasi-resonances--not
exact resonances--overn energy transfer and drive the system toward
thermalization. Crucially, the strength of exact resonances decays with
increasing system size, while quasi-resonance strength grows. Moreover, exact
resonance strength remains independent of nonlinearity, whereas quasi-resonance
strength diminishes with reduced nonlinearity. These observations provide
additional evidence supporting the aforementioned conclusion while elucidating
the size-dependent thermalization characteristics in lattice systems.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{proxitaxis}, a simple search strategy where the searcher
has only information about the distance from the target but not the direction.
The strategy consists of three crucial components: (i) local adaptive moves
with distance-dependent hopping rate, (ii) intermittent long range returns via
stochastic resetting to a certain location $\vec{R}_0$, and (iii) an inspection
move where the searcher dynamically updates the resetting position $\vec{R}_0$.
We compute analytically the capture probability of the target within this
strategy and show that it can be maximized by an optimal choice of the control
parameters of this strategy. Moreover, the optimal strategy undergoes multiple
phase transitions as a function of the control parameters. These phase
transitions are generic and occur in all dimensions.

Abstract: Most natural thermodynamic systems operate far from equilibrium, developing
persistent currents and organizing into non-equilibrium stationary states
(NESSs). Yet, the principles by which such systems self-organize, breaking
equilibrium symmetries under external and internal constraints, remain unclear.
Here, we establish a general connection between symmetry breaking and
dissipation in mesoscopic stochastic systems described by Langevin dynamics.
Using a geometric framework based on the inverse diffusion matrix, we decompose
the velocity field into excess (gradient) and housekeeping (residual)
components. This provides a natural entropy production split: the excess part
captures internal reorganization under non-equilibrium conditions, while the
housekeeping part quantifies detailed-balance violation due to external forces.
We derive an exact equality linking the two, along with an inequality
identifying accessible thermodynamics. A weak-noise expansion of the stationary
solution reveals the general geometry of the NESS velocity field, enabling a
unified classification of steady states. We apply this framework to systems
ranging from molecular machines to coupled oscillators, showing how symmetry
breaking in trajectory space constrains NESS organization. We further extend
our approach to systems with multiplicative noise, deriving how additional
symmetry breaking relates to curved (space-dependent) metrics. Finally, we show
that both the NESS velocity field and stationary distribution can be derived
through variational functionals based on excess dissipation. This work sheds
light on the intimate connection between geometric features, dissipative
properties, and symmetry breaking, uncovering a classification of NESSs that
reflects how emergent organization reflects physical non-equilibrium
conditions.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of charge fluctuations after homogeneous quantum
quenches in one-dimensional systems with ballistic transport. For short but
macroscopic times where the non-trivial dynamics is largely dominated by
long-range correlations, a simple expression for the associated full counting
statistics can be obtained by hydrodynamic arguments. This formula links the
non-equilibrium charge fluctuation after the quench to the fluctuations of the
associated current after a charge-biased inhomogeneous modification of the
original quench which corresponds to the paradigmatic partitioning protocol.
Under certain assumptions, the fluctuations in the latter case can be expressed
by explicit closed form formulas in terms of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic
quantities via the Ballistic Fluctuations Theory. In this work, we identify
precise physical conditions for the applicability of a fully hydrodynamic
theory, and provide a detailed analysis explicitly demonstrating how such
conditions are met and how this leads to such hydrodynamic treatment. We
discuss these conditions at length in non-relativistic free fermions, where
calculations become feasible and allow for cross-checks against exact results.
In physically relevant cases, strong long-range correlations can complicate the
hydrodynamic picture, but our formula still correctly reproduces the first
cumulants.

Abstract: The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at
three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed
balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living

energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation dissipation theorem.
In this manuscript, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters
that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding
qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the
phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of
time parameters compared to previous work, allowing to test it in systems with
limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in
dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in
MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in
terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum
as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data
to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种简单的方法来探测弛豫动力学，拓展了对量子Mpemba效应的理解，并揭示了其在无对称性系统中的新表现。

Abstract: We study the local relaxation of closed quantum systems through the relative
entropy between the reduced density matrix and its long time limit. We show,
using analytic arguments combined with numerical checks, that this relative
entropy can be very well approximated by an entropy difference, affording a
significant computational advantage. We go on to relate this to the
entanglement asymmetry of the subsystem with respect to time translation
invariance. In doing this, we obtain a simple probe of the relaxation dynamics
of closed many-body systems and use it to re-examine the quantum Mpemba effect,
wherein states can relax faster if they are initially further from equilibrium.
We reproduce earlier instances of the effect related to symmetry restoration as
well as uncover new cases in the absence of such symmetries. For integrable
models, we obtain the criteria for this to occur using the quasiparticle
picture. Lastly, we show that, in models obeying the entanglement membrane
picture, the quantum Mpemba effect cannot occur for a large class of initial
states.

Conclusion: 理论结果与模拟一致，揭示了重置时间分布对随机游走功能行为的显著影响。

Abstract: We derive the characteristic function of stochastic functionals of a random
walk whose position is reset to the origin at random times drawn from a general
probability distribution. We analyze the long-time behavior and obtain the
temporal scaling of the first two moments of any stochastic functional of the
random walk when the resetting time distribution exhibits a power-law tail.
When the resetting times PDF has finite moments, the probability density of any
functional converges to a delta function centered at its mean, indicating an
ergodic phase. We explicitly examine the case of the half-occupation time and
derive the ergodicity breaking parameter, the first two moments, and the
limiting distribution when the resetting time distribution follows a power-law
tail, for both Brownian and subdiffusive random walks. We characterize the
three different shapes of the limiting distribution as a function of the
exponent of the resetting distribution. Our theoretical findings are supported
by Monte Carlo simulations, which show excellent agreement with the analytical
results.

Method: 通过局部时间平均正则化扩展fBm定义，推导其自相关函数，并分析fOU过程的方差和条件过程的最优路径。

Result: 扩展fBm具有平稳性，扩散完全停止；fOU过程对约束势强度不敏感；在H=0时与传统结果连续匹配。

Conclusion: 扩展fBm和fOU过程在强反持续区域表现出独特性质，为相关理论和应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian
non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a
prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and
anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent
$H$ in the range $-1/2<H<0$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly
anti-persistent regime $-1/2<H<0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process,
so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The
extended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation
function. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this
region of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian
process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended
to the range $-1/2<H<0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably,
the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the
confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned
fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2<H<0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results
match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU
processes.

Conclusion: 研究为异质性到同质性临界性的交叉提供了统一的理论框架，并澄清了先前的理论争议。

Abstract: Critical phenomena on scale-free networks with a degree distribution $p_k
\sim k^{-\lambda}$ exhibit rich finite-size effects due to its structural
heterogeneity. We systematically study the finite-size scaling of percolation
and identify two distinct crossover routes to mean-field behavior: one
controlled by the degree exponent $\lambda$, the other by the degree cutoff $K
\sim V^{\kappa}$, where $V$ is the system size and $\kappa \in [0,1]$ is the
cutoff exponent. Increasing $\lambda$ or decreasing $\kappa$ suppresses
heterogeneity and drives the system toward mean-field behavior, with
logarithmic corrections near the marginal case. These findings provide a
unified picture of the crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous criticality.
In the crossover regime, we observe rich finite-size phenomena, including the
transition from vanishing to divergent susceptibility, distinct exponents for
the shift and fluctuation of pseudocritical points, and a numerical
clarification of previous theoretical debates.

Result: HU流体的临界维度从4降至2，表现出反常的零程关联函数和无有效涨落-耗散关系。

Conclusion: 非平衡效应可重塑经典相变的普适性类别，为液-气临界现象提供了例外。

Abstract: In statistical physics, a well-accepted knowledge is that liquid-gas (LG)
phase transition with diverging critical fluctuations lies in the universality
class of Ising model. Yet, whether non-equilibrium effect alone can alter this
conclusion remains an open question. Here, we study the LG criticality of a
hyperuniform (HU) fluid composed of active spinners, where phase separation is
induced by dissipative collisions. Strikingly, at the LG critical point, the HU
fluid exhibits normal Gaussian density fluctuations instead of the diverging
fluctuations. Through hydrodynamic field theory and renormalization-group
analysis, we demonstrate that hyperuniformity reduces the upper critical
dimension from d_c = 4 (classical fluids) to d_c = 2 due to an emerging
long-range correlation induced by center-of-mass conservation. Large-scale
stochastic field simulations confirm this dimensional reduction, and reveal
diverging response function along with anomalous zero-range correlation
function at the critical point, indicating the absence of an effective
fluctuation-dissipation relationship in the system. The simulation also
identifies anomalous finite-size scaling in density fluctuation, energy
fluctuation, and Binder cumulant. Furthermore, HU fluid also exihibits
non-classical spinodal decomposition dynamics with diverging decomposition time
but non-diverging decomposition length scale. Our results provide an exception
to the classical paradigms of LG critical phenomena and highlight how
non-equilibrium effect can reshape universality classes of classical phase
transitions.

Conclusion: 活性Ising模型的临界行为受密度影响，新的普适类取代传统Wilson-Fisher普适类。

Abstract: The Ising model is one of the most well known models in statistical physics,
with its critical behavior governed by the Wilson-Fisher universality class
(UC). When active motility is incorporated into the Ising model by, e.g.,
dictating that the spins' directional movements follow their orientations, the
spin number density necessarily constitutes a soft mode in the hydrodynamic
description, and can therefore modify the scaling behavior of the system. Here,
we show that this is indeed the case in a critical active Ising model in which
density can impede the system's collective motion. Specifically, we use a
perturbative dynamic renormalization group method to the one-loop level to
uncover three new UCs, one of which supersedes the Wilson-Fisher UC to become
the generic UC that governs the critical behavior of the active Ising model.

Conclusion: 活性湍流的不可逆性主要由活性应力的奇点和缺陷对的构型决定，为理解远离平衡态的动力学提供了新视角。

Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to
stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is
often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of
passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly
operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent
features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible
dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from
singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled
dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that
the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall
irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific
configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展对称拓扑场论（SymTFT）框架的方法，用于描述混合态量子系统，引入了“对称双层拓扑序”（symmetry taco）概念，并揭示了其在分类和映射混合态量子相中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称拓扑场论在描述纯态量子相方面取得了显著成功，但其在开放量子系统（混合态）中的应用尚未探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过引入“对称双层拓扑序”（symmetry taco），构建了一个双层拓扑序的几何结构，用于描述1+1维混合态量子系统的对称性。

Result: 揭示了混合态量子相中的一系列对应关系，包括固有无能隙SPT（igSPT）与某些有能隙SPT的一一映射，以及igSPT与1+1维混合态中的固有平均SPT（iASPT）的映射。此外，还分类了1+1维短程关联的G对称Choi态，并发现了一种新的混合态“反常”。

Conclusion: 对称双层拓扑序不仅将混合态量子相纳入SymTFT框架，还为探索混合态量子物质中的对偶性、反常和非平衡临界性提供了新途径。

Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, offers
a unifying framework for describing quantum phases of matter and phase
transitions between them. While this approach has seen remarkable success in
describing gapped and gapless pure-state phases in $1+1$d, its applicability to
open quantum systems remains entirely unexplored. In this work, we propose a
natural extension of the SymTFT framework to mixed-state phases by introducing
the \textit{symmetry taco}: a bilayer topological order in $2+1$d whose folded
geometry naturally encapsulates both strong and weak symmetries of the $1+1$d
theory. We use this perspective to identify a series of correspondences,
including a one-to-one map between intrinsically gapless SPTs (igSPTs) and
certain gapped SPTs, and a mapping between igSPTs and intrinsically average
SPTs (iASPTs) arising in $1+1$d mixed states. More broadly, our framework
yields a classification of short-range correlated $G$-symmetric Choi states in
$1+1$d, provides a route for systematically generating mixed-state SPTs via
local decoherence of igSPTs, and allows us to identify a new mixed-state
``anomaly". Besides folding in mixed-state phases into the SymTFT paradigm, the
symmetry taco opens new avenues for exploring dualities, anomalies, and
non-equilibrium criticality in mixed-state quantum matter.

Abstract: We study a square lattice SU(2) gauge theory with link variables $U$,
formulated to describe the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal phase of
underdoped cuprates of hole density $p$, and its evolution into nodal $d$-wave
superconductivity upon cooling. The theory features two fermionic matter
sectors: one consists of SU(2)-gauge-neutral, electron-like quasiparticles
forming hole pockets; the other is a critical quantum spin liquid composed of
electrically neutral spinons, carrying spin $S = 1/2$, Dirac nodes, and
transforming in the fundamental representation of the SU(2) gauge group. These
sectors interact via a Yukawa coupling to a spinless Higgs boson $B$, which
carries electric charge $+e$ and also transforms under the fundamental
representation of SU(2). The theory arises from a canonical transformation of
the square lattice Hubbard model and a pair of ancilla qubits on each site,
along with a specific choice of the spin liquid. We employ a
Born-Oppenheimer-type approximation: thermal fluctuations of the bosons $B$ and
$U$ are treated classically, while the fermions are fully quantum. Monte Carlo
simulations of an effective boson energy functional are consistent with a
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition involving $h/(2e)$ vortices, driving the onset
of $d$-wave superconductivity. Each vortex is surrounded by a halo of charge
order, consistent with scanning tunneling microscopy observations by Hoffman et
al. (arXiv:cond-mat/0201348). Above the transition, the electron spectral
function exhibits "Fermi arcs", in agreement with ARPES data by Norman et al.
(arXiv:cond-mat/9710163) and Shen et al. (Science 307, 901 (2005)). Our model
also displays quantum oscillations with area $p/8$ under a magnetic field,
aligning with recent evidence via the Yamaji effect by Chan et al.
(arXiv:2411.10631).

Abstract: Quantum electronic fluids with spin and valley degrees of freedom have a
correlation driven tendency to flavor polarization (generalized
ferromagnetism). To first order in the long-range Coulomb interactions -- i.e.
in the Hartree-Fock approximation -- spin and valley polarization exhibit a
spurious degeneracy. We show that to second order -- or more generally in the
random-phase approximation -- this degeneracy is lifted in a way that depends
only on the underlying symmetry relating the two valleys. In two spatial
dimensions, if the valleys are related by an $n-$fold rotation ($n>2$) or by
mirror reflection and each valley is invariant under $C_2$ or time reversal (as
is the case in AlAs quantum wells) then valley polarization is preferred. If
the valleys are related by time reversal or by $C_2$ rotation symmetry (as in
multilayer graphene systems) then spin order is selected.

Abstract: We study electrical and thermal transport in a one-dimensional Luttinger
liquid coupled to a three-dimensional acoustic phonon in both the ``clean"

matrix formalism. By explicitly incorporating the Debye cutoff on phonon
frequencies, we consider the low and high temperature transport regimes. We
find the crossover temperature separating these two regimes to be
interaction-dependent, with repulsive interactions increasing the crossover
temperature by at most an order of magnitude. This provides an illustration for
how interactions can enhance the low-temperature scattering regime in an
interacting Fermi system.

Motivation: To explore the electronic nematicity in layered antiferromagnet CoTa$_3$S$_6$ and its manipulation by strain and magnetic fields.

Method: Demonstrated nematic order via resistivity anisotropy and optical birefringence, manipulated by strain and magnetic fields.

Result: Nematic state emerges at $T^*$, distinct from antiferromagnetic transitions, with non-volatile memory effects and restored symmetry under out-of-plane fields.

Conclusion: CoTa$_3$S$_6$ is a tunable antiferromagnetic platform with intertwined electronic nematicity and spin orders, breaking multiple symmetries.

Abstract: The operation mechanism of nematic liquid crystals lies in the control of
their optical properties by the orientation of underlying nematic directors. In
analogy, electronic nematicity refers to a state whose electronic properties
spontaneously break rotation symmetries of the host crystalline lattice,
leading to anisotropic electronic properties. In this work, we demonstrate that
the layered antiferromagnet CoTa$_3$S$_6$ exhibits a switchable nematic order,
evidenced by the emergence of both resistivity anisotropy and optical
birefringence. This nematic state sets in at a temperature $T^*$ distinct from
that of the antiferromagnetic transitions in the system, indicating a separate
symmetry-breaking mechanism. The nematic order can be manipulated either by an
in-plane rotation symmetry-breaking strain or in-plane magnetic field, with the
latter exhibiting a pronounced non-volatile memory effect. Remarkably, we find
that the broken three-fold rotation symmetry in electronic transport is
restored with a moderate out-of-plane field. We hypothesize that the nematicity
is of electronic origin and emerges from instabilities associated with van Hove
singularities. The resulting phase diagram points to an intertwined interplay
between the electronic nematicity and the proposed underlying collinear and
non-coplanar spin orders. Our findings establish CoTa$_3$S$_6$ as a versatile
antiferromagnetic platform with highly tunable functionalities arising from the
breaking of rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetries.

Abstract: Energy conversion in materials can be considered as a sequence of elementary
steps initiated by a primary excitation. While these steps are quite well
understood in classical semiconductors in terms of quasiparticle (QP)
excitations and interactions, their understanding in strongly correlated
materials is still elusive. Here, we review the progress which has been
achieved over recent years by studies of manganite perovskite oxides as a model
system for materials with strong correlations. They show a subtle interplay of
different types of correlations, i.e., electron-phonon, electron-electron and
spin-spin, resulting in rich physical phenomena due to competition between
different ground states accompanied by temperature- and field-induced phase
transitions. They strongly impact various types of energy conversion and
transport processes including friction at surfaces, thermal transport, time-,
energy- and power-dependent optical excitations as well as photovoltaic energy
conversion. The underlying microscopic processes can be broken down to the
behavior of the low-energy thermal and high-energy optical excitations, their
interactions, transport and conversion which are theoretically analyzed by
using models of interacting and tunable QPs: Their nature and interactions can
change during excitation, transport and phase transitions, thus modifying
electronic structure. At sufficiently high stimulation, QP excitations can even
induce or actuate phase transitions. As a result, we obtained a comprehensive
understanding of energy conversion steps going far beyond single QP pictures
and rigid band approximations well-known for conventional semiconductors.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the properties of single-crystalline YNiSn$_{2}$
through x-ray powder diffraction, elemental analysis, electrical resistivity,
magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. YNiSn$_{2}$
crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure within the Cmcm space group (63),
forming plate-like crystals with the $b$ axis oriented out of the plane. The
compound exhibits weak Pauli paramagnetism with a susceptibility of $\chi_{0} =

4$ mJ/mol$\cdot$K$^{2}$, indicating a low density of states at the Fermi level.
Notably, at 1.8 K, YNiSn$_{2}$ displays a giant positive magnetoresistance of
nearly 1000\%, which increases quasi-linearly with the magnetic field up to $B

Abstract: The localized (particle-like) correlated electrons deserve particular
attention as they govern various exotic quantum phenomena, such as quantum spin
liquids, Wigner crystals, and Mott insulators in correlated systems. However,
direct observation and manipulation of these particle-like electrons at the
atomic or single-electron scale remain highly challenging. Here, we
successfully realize and directly visualize particle-like correlated electrons
in 1T-TaS2 through hole doping. The potential-dependent local electronic
structure of single particle-like electron is revealed by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)
combined with theoretical calculations. The complex correlated interactions
including nearest-neighbor attractive interactions and many-body repulsive
interactions are further demonstrated and discussed based on the spatial
distribution of particle-like electrons. Furthermore, the tentative
manipulation of the particle-like electrons is successfully achieved by the
energy-excitation mechanism. Our results not only provide profound insights
into particle-like electrons in correlated systems, but also establish a
versatile platform for designing and controlling quantum states at the atomic
scale.

Abstract: Contrary to traditional approaches, high entropy oxides (HEOs) strategically
employ cationic disorder to engineer tunable functionalities. This disorder,
stemming from multiple elements at the same crystallographic site, disrupts
local symmetry and induces local distortions. By examining a series of
single-crystalline
[La$_{0.2}$Pr$_{0.2}$Nd$_{0.2}$Sm$_{0.2}$Eu$_{0.2}$]NiO$_{3-\delta}$ thin
films, we demonstrate herein that the creation of oxygen vacancies (OVs)
further offers a powerful means of tailoring electronic behavior of HEOs by
concurrently introducing disorder in the oxygen sublattice and doping electrons
into the system. Increasing OV concentration leads to a monotonic increase in
room-temperature sheet resistance. A striking feature is the Janus-faced
response of the metal-insulator transition (MIT) to OVs due to the interplay
among correlation energy scales, electron doping, and disorder. Unlike the
monotonous influence of OV observed for the MIT in VO$_2$ and V$_2$O$_3$,
initial OV doping lowers the MIT temperature here, whereas higher OV levels
completely suppress the metallic phase. Magnetotransport measurements further
reveal weak localization, strong localization as a function of $\delta$.
Moreover, the disorder on both $RE$ and oxygen sublattices is responsible for
the Mott-Anderson insulator state. These findings surpass the scope of the
recently featured `electron antidoping' effect and demonstrate the promising
opportunity to utilize OV engineering of HEOs for Mottronics and
optoelectronics applications.

Abstract: Non-equilibrium control of electronic properties in condensed matter systems
can result in novel phenomena. In this work, we provide a novel non-equilibrium
route to realize half-metallic phases. We explore the periodically driven
Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice and demonstrate that a periodic drive can
transform a weakly interacting metal into a ferrimagnetic half-metal. We
consider a Fermi-Hubbard model with only nearest-neighbour hopping and
stabilize the elusive phase simply by driving the site potentials periodically.
The drive induces staggered second and third-neighbor hopping and a staggered
potential between two sublattices in the Floquet Hamiltonian, whose ground
state is explored in this work. Close to the dynamical freezing point, due to
the suppression of nearest neighbor hopping in the driven system, an effective
enhancement of various terms in the Floquet Hamiltonian, including the e-e
interactions, occurs. This helps in stabilizing a broad ferrimagnetic
half-metallic phase for a wide range of system parameters. The half-metallic
phase achieved in the presence of high drive frequency should be stable for
exponentially large time scales in drive frequency and could be perpetually
stable beyond a strong enough drive amplitude owing to dynamical freezing. It
can hence have potential applications in stable spintronics and other upcoming
quantum technologies.

Result: 研究发现基于矩的方法表现良好，但在某些物理条件下（如掺杂），瞬时相互作用无法完全捕捉相关物理。

Conclusion: 动态相互作用到瞬时相互作用的映射在某些情况下有效，但在特定条件下仍需考虑动态效应。

Abstract: Correlated electron physics is intrinsically a multiscale problem, since
high-energy electronic states screen the interactions between the correlated
electrons close to the Fermi level, thereby reducing the magnitude of the
interaction strength and dramatically shortening its range. Thus, the handling
of screening is an essential ingredient in the first-principles modelling of
correlated electron systems. Screening is an intrinsically dynamic process and
the corresponding downfolding methods such as the constrained Random Phase
Approximation indeed produce a dynamic interaction. However, many low-energy
methods require an instantaneous interaction as input, which makes it necessary
to map the fully dynamic interaction to an effective instantaneous interaction
strength. It is a priori not clear if and when such an effective model can
capture the physics of the one with dynamic interaction and how to best perform
the mapping. Here, we provide a systematic benchmark relevant to correlated
materials, in the form of the Anderson impurity model. Overall, we find that a
moment-based approach recently proposed by Scott and Booth performs well. We
also identify physical regimes, especially under doping, where an instantaneous
interaction cannot capture all of the relevant physics.

Conclusion: D-TRILEX扩展是一种高效且准确的方法，适用于处理强关联电子系统，并提出了改进簇图解展开起点的计算方案。

Abstract: In this work, we extend the theoretical approach known as "D-TRILEX",
developed for solving correlated electronic systems, to a cluster reference
system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently
combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the
cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge
and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring
Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations.
Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces
the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in
good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the
problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach
based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic
extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities
when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical
mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem
as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the
computational scheme for improving the starting point for the
cluster-diagrammatic expansion.

Abstract: We extend the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) framework to open
quantum systems. Using canonical purification, we embed mixed states into a
doubled (2+1)-dimensional topological order and employ the slab construction to
study (1+1)-dimensional mixed-state phases through condensable algebras in the
doubled SymTFT. Hermiticity and positivity of the density matrix impose
additional constraints on allowable anyon condensations, enabling a systematic
classification of mixed-state phases - including strong-to-weak symmetry
breaking (SWSSB) and average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases. We
present examples of mixed-state phase transitions involving SWSSB and show how
gauging within the open SymTFT framework reveals connections among different
mixed-state phases.

Abstract: Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in
condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate
results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how
relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and
two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of
the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve
efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of operator monomials for
different model parameters, we identify all first- and second-order transitions
based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry
breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using
these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional
transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer
Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter
changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our
work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying
and understanding quantum phase transitions.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) hosts a rich landscape of electronic phases
arising from the interplay between strong electron-electron interactions and
nontrivial band topology. While the flat bands near zero energy are central to
many correlated phenomena, their interaction with higher-energy remote bands
remains less understood. Here, we investigate these hybridization processes as
a function of the twist angle and analyze their impact on the charge
distribution, topological properties such as Chern number, quantum metric, and
orbital magnetic energy. We identify multiple topological phase transitions
between magic angles, driven by band inversions at high-symmetry points in
momentum space. Notably, the central bands can exhibit phases with Chern
numbers C = 2, revealing previously unreported topological states in TBG.

Abstract: Axisymmetric solid-state necking of a single-crystal metallic nanowire in a
thermal contact with a substrate and subjected to a surface electromigration
current is accompanied by a local current crowding and a sharp rise of a
resistivity of a wire material in a thinning neck. This results in a
temperature spike at the neck, which feedback affects the necking via
thermomigration and the temperature-dependent surface diffusivity of the
adatoms. A model that incorporates these effects and couples the nonlinear
dynamics of a wire temperature and a wire radius for a necking wire is
presented. Conditions on the physical parameters are derived that ensure a
straight wire is in the solid state prior to an onset of a morphological
instability that ultimately breaks a wire via a pinch-off. The impacts of a
wire radius and a wire length on the temperature spike at the break junction
are studied.

Conclusion: FLBP的电子输运具有强各向异性，反超克莱因隧穿现象为新型电子器件设计提供了潜在应用。

Abstract: The electronic transport in few-layer black phosphorus (FLBP) nanoribbons is
studied theoretically. The system is modeled on the basis of band-structures,
which have been measured recently by $\mu$-ARPES experiments. We show that the
anisotropic bands of FLBP leads to highly anisotropic transport properties;
while the current in one direction can be rather focused, it can be strongly
disperse in the orthogonal direction. The low-energy current is carried mainly
in the central layer due to the vertical confinement of the electrons. In FLBP
pn junctions, generated by the electrostatic potential of a gate contact in a
certain region of the system, the electrons pass through the interface of the
junction, if it is oriented along the zigzag direction of FLBP. If the junction
is rotated by 90 degree and oriented along the armchair direction, the current
is reflected completely for all angles of incidence and for a wide range of
electron energies. This omni-directional total reflection is named
anti-super-Klein tunneling as it is due to opposite pseudo-spins of the
electrons in the two region of the pn junction. The effect of oxidation of the
top layer of FLBP pn junctions is investigated and it is found that, while the
current flow in the top layers is strongly suppressed, the anti-super-Klein
tunneling persists.

Abstract: In materials known as failed insulators, electrical resistivity increases as

single-particle theories. We investigate the origin of this behavior by
measuring shot noise in nanojunctions of nitrogen-doped beta-Ta, a prototypical
failed insulator. Junctions as short as 8 nanometers exhibit hot-electron shot
noise, indicating strong electron interactions. We show that charge hopping
mediated by these interactions explains the anomalous electronic properties.
Our findings open new avenues for exploiting electron interactions in
spin-orbitronic and superconducting applications of failed insulators.

Abstract: Bilayer graphene, forming moir\'e superlattices, possesses distinct
electronic and optical properties derived from the hybridization of energy band
and the emergence of van Hove singularities depending on its twist angle.
Extensive research has been conducted on the global characteristics of moir\'e
superlattice induced by long-range periodicity. However, limited attention has
been given to the local properties within a moir\'e unit cell, which
undoubtedly differ due to the variations in three-dimensional atomic
arrangement. Here we demonstrate the highly localized excitations of carbon 1s
electrons to unoccupied van Hove singularities in a twisted bilayer graphene
using an electron energy loss spectroscopy based on a monochromated
transmission electron microscope. The core-level excitations associated with
the van Hove singularities show a systematic twist angle dependence which is
analogous to the optical excitations. Furthermore, local variations in those
core-level van Hove singularity peaks within a moir\'e unit cell have been
corroborated for the first time, which can originate from core-exciton
lifetimes and band modifications influenced by the local stacking geometry.

Abstract: Altermagnets and compensated ferrimagnets have attracted considerable
attention as key building blocks in spintronics devices, owing to their dual
advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. In particular, compensated
ferrimagnets exhibit isotropic spin splitting in their electronic and magnon
dispersions, despite having zero net magnetization. This characteristic feature
enables spin transport phenomena analogous to those in ferromagnets. However,
quantitative evaluations of such spin transport phenomena, particularly in
comparison to conventional ferromagnets, remain unexplored. Here we investigate
spin pumping and spin Seebeck effects in a junction between a compensated
ferrimagnet and a normal metal using the non-equilibrium Green's function
method. We find that the isotropic spin splitting in magnon dispersions gives
rise to spin transport phenomena similar to those observed in ferromagnets. Our
results provide a solid theoretical foundation for the applications of exotic
collinear antiferromagnets with spin splitting to spintronics devices.

Abstract: The second-order nonlinear electrical response (NLER) is an intrinsic
property of inversion symmetry-broken systems which can provide deep insights
into the electronic band structures of atomically thin quantum materials.
However, the impact of Fermi surface reconstructions, also known as Lifshitz
transitions, on the NLER has remained elusive. We investigated NLER in bilayer
graphene (BLG), where the low-energy bands undergo Lifshitz transitions. Here,
NLER undergoes a sign change near the Lifshitz transitions even at elevated
temperatures $T\gtrsim10~$K. At the band edge, NLER in BLG is modulated by both
extrinsic scattering and interfacial-strain-induced intrinsic Berry curvature
dipole, both of which can be finely tuned externally by varying doping and
interlayer potential. Away from the band edge, BLG exhibits second-order
conductivity exceeding $30~\mu$mV$^{-1}\Omega^{-1}$ at 3K higher than any
previous report. Our work establishes NLER as a reliable tool to probe Lifshitz
transitions in quantum materials.

singularities (vHSs) in the electronic density of states. However, the role of
these reconstructions in shaping NLER remains insufficiently understood. In
this work, we systematically explore NLER in moir\'e superlattices of twisted
double bilayer graphene (tDBLG) by tuning the Fermi level across multiple
moir\'e bands on both sides of the charge neutrality point. We observe sharp
variations and sign reversals in the NLER appearing via extrinsic pathways near
mid-band vHSs. The second-order conductivity close to the vHSs demonstrates a
much higher value than previous reports of extrinsic NLER in any other
material. Our results demonstrate that NLER can serve as a sensitive probe of
Fermi surface reconstructions and establish tDBLG as a versatile and highly
efficient platform for generating and controlling the nonlinear electrical
response.

Abstract: The growing interest in quantum magnonics is driving the development of
advanced techniques for generating, controlling, and detecting non-classical
magnonic states. Here, we explore the potential of an ensemble of solid-state
spin defects coupled to a shared magnetic bath as a source of such states. We
establish a theoretical framework to characterize the quantum correlations
among magnons emitted by the ensemble into the bath and investigate how these
correlations depend on experimentally tunable parameters. Our findings show
that the emitted magnons retain the quantum correlations inherent to the
solid-state emitters, paving the way for the deterministic generation of
quantum many-body magnonic states.

Abstract: We investigate the spin properties of InAs/InGaAs/InP quantum dots grown by
metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) deposition using droplet epitaxy,
which emit in the telecom C-band. Using pump-probe Faraday ellipticity
measurements, we determine electron and hole $g$-factors of $|g_e| = 0.934$ and
$|g_h| = 0.471$, with the electron $g$-factor being nearly twice as low as
typical molecular beam epitaxy Stranski-Krastanov (SK) grown samples. Most
significantly, we measure a longitudinal spin relaxation time $T_1 = 2.95\,\mu
s$, representing an order of magnitude improvement over comparable MBE SK grown
samples. Despite significant electron $g$-factor anisotropy, we observed that
it is reduced relative to similar material composition samples grown with MBE
or MOVPE SK methods. We attribute these g-factor anisotropy and spin lifetime
improvements to the enhanced structural symmetry achieved via MOVPE droplet
epitaxy, which mitigates the inherent structural asymmetry in strain-driven
growth approaches for InAs/InP quantum dots. These results demonstrate that
MOVPE droplet epitaxy-grown InAs/InGaAs/InP quantum dots exhibit favorable spin
properties for potential implementation in quantum information applications.

Abstract: Topological flat bands play an essential role in inducing exotic interacting
physics, ranging from fractional Chern insulators to superconductivity, in
moir\'e materials. When topological flat bands possess concentrated quantum
geometry, a topological heavy fermion (THF) model was proposed as the starting
point to describe the interacting moir\'e physics. In this work, we propose a
design principle for realizing "ideal" THF model, which can host an exact flat
band with "ideal quantum geometry", namely the trace of Fubini-Study metric
equals to the Berry curvature, in a class of two-dimensional moir\'e
heterostructures with type-II band alignment. We first introduce a moir\'e
Chern-band model to describe this system and show that topological flat bands
can be realized in this model when the moir\'e superlattice potential is
stronger than the type-II atomic band gap of the heterostructure. Next, we map
this model into a THF model that consists of a localized orbital for
"f-electron" and a conducting band for "c-electron". We find that both the
flatness and quantum geometry of the mini-bands in this THF model depend on the
energy gap between c-electron and f-electron bands at $\Gamma$ which is
experimentally controllable via external gate voltages. This tunability will
allow us to realize an "ideal" topological flat band with zero band-width and
"ideal quantum geometry" in this THF model. Our design strategy of topological
flat bands is insensitive of twist angle. We also discuss possible material
candidates for moir\'e heterostructures with type-II band alignment.
