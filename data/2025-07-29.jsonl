There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems,\nwhere class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively.\nWe utilize the local number variance $\\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window\nof radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic\nlarge-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We\nfind, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals,\ndisordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a\nfaster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by\ncorrections with integer powers of $1/R$.

In metallic nanoresonators, dissipation phenomena limit the\npolariton lifetime to a few ten femtoseconds, so short that the role of these\npolaritons for the nonlinearities of such hybrids is yet unexplored. Here, we\nuse ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to uncover\ncoherent polariton dynamics in a hybrid monolayer (1L) WS2/plasmonic\nnanostructure.

We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning\nframework for learning partial differential equations, with an application\nfocus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn\nthe invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial\nmemory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a\ncompact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data\nstorage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw\nsimulation data.

The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent\nchannel flow.

In this\nwork, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local\ntransport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current\nthrough a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the\ncurrent is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors,\nbecoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of\nlocal electron-hole symmetry, {\\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply\nour method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow\nsuperconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles\n(zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We\ndemonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana\npolarization (MP) -- a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the\nstate. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents\nand benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that\ninclude a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results\nprovide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short\nKitaev chains."}

Many subfields, including quantum\nsimulation of continuous-variable systems, quantum chemistry, and quantum\nmachine learning, rely on the ability to accurately and efficiently prepare\nstates that reflect a Gaussian profile in their probability amplitudes.\nAlthough Gaussian states are natural in continuous-variable systems, the\npractical interest in digital, gate-based quantum computers demands discrete\napproximations of Gaussian distributions over a computational basis of size\n\\(2^n\\). Because of the exponential scaling of naive amplitude-encoding\napproaches and the cost of certain block-encoding or Hamiltonian simulation\ntechniques, a resource-efficient preparation of approximate Gaussian states is\nrequired. In this work, we propose and analyze a circuit-based approach that\nstarts with single-qubit rotations to form an exponential amplitude profile and\nthen applies the quantum Fourier transform to map those amplitudes into an\napproximate Gaussian distribution.

The list of problems we tackle\nincludes propagation of a free wave packet, vibration of a harmonic oscillator,\nand tunneling through a barrier. Each of these problems starts with the initial\nwave packet setup. Although Qiskit provides a general method for initializing\nwavefunctions, in most cases it generates deep quantum circuits. While these\ncircuits perform well on noiseless simulators, they suffer from excessive noise\non quantum hardware. To overcome this issue, we designed a shallower quantum\ncircuit for preparing a Gaussian-like initial wave packet, which improves the\nperformance on real hardware. Next, quantum circuits are implemented to apply\nthe kinetic and potential energy operators for the evolution of a wavefunction\nover time. The results of our modelling on classical emulators of quantum\nhardware agree perfectly with the results obtained using the traditional\n(classical) methods. This serves as a benchmark and demonstrates that the\nquantum algorithms and Qiskit codes we developed are accurate.
