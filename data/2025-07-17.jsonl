Chapter 2 explores the challenge of constructing arbitrary\nquantum states from given initial states, and introduces circuits for building\noracles. Chapter 3 presents foundational algorithms such as entanglement\ncreation, quantum teleportation, Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Simon's\nalgorithm.\n  Chapters 4 and 5 cover algorithms based on the quantum Fourier transform,\nincluding phase estimation, period finding, factoring, and logarithm\ncomputation. These chapters also include complexity analysis and detailed\nquantum circuits suitable for implementation in code. Chapter 6 introduces\nGrover's algorithm for quantum search and amplitude amplification, including\nits realization via Hamiltonian simulation and a method for derandomization.\n  Chapter 7 discusses basic techniques for Hamiltonian simulation, such as\nLie-Trotter decomposition, sparse Hamiltonians, and the linear combination of\nunitaries. It also provides example circuits for simulating Hamiltonians\nexpressed as linear combinations of Pauli operators. Chapter 8 introduces\nvariational quantum algorithms, and Chapter 9 presents an algorithm for\nsimulating fermionic many-particle systems, with an emphasis on molecular\nHamiltonians. It also outlines the key transformations needed to map a\nmolecular Hamiltonian to a form suitable for simulation on a quantum computer."}

In recent years two\npowerful generalisations of this product -- the lifted and balanced products --\nhave been proposed and employed to great success, but a unified graphical\napproach to describing these codes has been absent.

Using this theory as\nmotivation, we develop efficient algorithms which estimate our new measure of\ncontextuality in sequential data, and empirically show that this estimate is a\ngood predictor for the difference in performance of resource-constrained\nclassical and quantum Bayesian networks in modeling the data. Strong\nk-contextuality thus emerges as a measure to help identify problems that are\ndifficult for classical computers, but may not be for quantum computers."}
