One of the simplest examples, the\nSSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection\nbetween localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the\nSSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the\nlocalized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how\none can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by\ncareful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or\nspin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together\nthey construct a chain of spin qubits. As this system is realizable\nexperimentally, our findings provide a novel way for manipulating and\nengineering spin qubits in physical systems."}

Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected\nnano-sized spin textures that can enable high-density low-power spin-based\nelectronics.

The nature\nof the electronic structure of GdRu2X2 is characterized by chemical bonding,\nFermi surface analysis, and density of energy function. As X-p orbitals become\nmore extended from Si-3p to Ge-4p and Sn-5p, improved interactions between the\nGd spins and the [Ru2X2] conduction layer and increased destabilizing energy\ncontributions are obtained.

While extensively studied in non-interacting\nsystems, the interplay between NHSE and strong electron correlations remains\nlargely unexplored. Here, we investigate the non-Hermitian Hubbard model with\nasymmetric hopping, employing real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT),\na novel extension to such non-Hermitian correlated models-to capture both local\ncorrelations and spatial inhomogeneities. By analyzing the end-to-end Green's\nfunction as probes of directional amplification, we demonstrate that strong\ncorrelations can suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from\nboundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics.

However, this method is computationally\nexpensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors\nincreases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based\npredictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic\nGraph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498\nquantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using\nQiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv,\nIBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte).\nPerformance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate\nfidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on\nthe trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting\nplatforms.

While there exist the no-hiding and\nno-masking theorems, approximate quantum information masking (AQIM) offers a\npromising means of circumventing the constraints. Despite its potential, AQIM\nstill remains underexplored, and constructing explicit approximate maskers\nremains a challenge. In this work, we investigate AQIM from multiple\nperspectives and propose using random isometries to construct approximate\nmaskers. First, different notions of AQIM are introduced and we find there are\nprofound intrinsic connections among them. These relationships are\ncharacterized by a set of figures of merit, which are introduced to quantify\nthe deviation of AQIM from exact QIM. We then explore the possibility of\nrealizing AQIM via random isometries in bipartite and multipartite systems. In\nbipartite systems, we identify a fundamental lower bound for a key figure of\nmerit, implying that almost all random isometries fail to realize AQIM. This\nsurprising result generalizes the original no-masking theorem to the\nno-random-AQIM theorem for bipartite systems. In contrast, in multipartite\nsystems, we show almost all random isometries can realize AQIM. Remarkably, the\nnumber of physical qubits required to randomly mask a single logical qubit\nscales only linearly. We further explore the implications of these findings. In\nparticular, we show that, under certain conditions, approximate quantum error\ncorrection is equivalent to AQIM. Consequently, AQIM naturally gives rise to\napproximate quantum error correction codes with constant code rates and\nexponentially small correction inaccuracies. Overall, our results establish\nquantum information masking as a central concept in quantum information theory,\nbridging diverse notions across multiple domains."}

In two-dimensional\nflatband systems, charge responses have been intensively investigated, yet\nneutral excitations remain largely unexplored. In particular, intervalley\ncoherent state (IVC) features a neutral Goldstone mode due to spontaneously\nbroken valley U(1) symmetry. While IVC state has been proposed as a unifying\ntheme across graphene- and semiconductor-based systems, its defining feature -\nthe neutral Goldstone mode - remains elusive in experiment. Here we investigate\nspace-and-time-resolved transport of neutral modes in twisted WSe2 moir\\'e\nsuperlattices through a novel ultrafast imaging technique. We uncover two new\npropagating collective modes with very different velocities, which emerge near\nthe van Hove singularity (VHS) in both intermediate- (3.5~4 degree) and\nlarge-angle (~5 degree) twisted WSe2. The fast-propagating mode has a\nsurprisingly large speed of ~3 km/s and is consistent with a Goldstone mode for\nan IVC state, while the slow-moving mode is likely a gapped amplitude mode.\nThey can be understood as the spin-valley analogues of collective modes of a\nsuperfluid, whose propagation are imaged for the first time in a condensed\nmatter system. Our study sets a new paradigm for probing charge-neutral modes\nin quantum materials and offers key insights into the interplay between charge\nand spin-valley physics in moir\\'e superlattices."}

Analogous to quantum gas\nmicroscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the\nhigh-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the\nground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data\ndemonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously\npair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing\npattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we\nreconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its\nconnection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs\nenable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double\nstripes.

We show analytically\nthat this universal behavior can be traced back to how systems that can be\nmapped onto a dissipative linear parametric oscillator (DLPO) satisfy the\nadiabatic-impulse (AI) approximation, evinced by the divergence of the\nrelaxation time of the DLPO near a critical point. We verify our predictions in\nboth the classical and quantum regimes by considering two systems: the\nSine-Gordon model, which is a paradigmatic system for emulating classical DTCs;\nand the open Dicke lattice model, an array of spin-boson systems subjected to\nquantum fluctuations. For both systems, the DTCs can be tuned from a\nferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic order by varying the driving frequency,\nthus allowing us to test the validity of KZM for arbitrary spatiotemporal\nordering."}
