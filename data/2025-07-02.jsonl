By casting the\nregression task as a constrained combinatorial problem over a structured digit\nlattice, the method replaces continuous inference with interpretable and\ntractable updates. A hybrid quantum-classical architecture is employed: quantum\ncircuits generate candidate digits through projective measurement, while\nclassical forward models evaluate these candidates based on task-specific error\nfunctionals.

In particular, we show that the application of\nmodern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the\ncorrelation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper\ncritical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent\n$\\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been\nquestioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising\nmodel, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold\neven when $d$ is not an integer."}

Determining whether or not a physical system\nwill thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed\nmatter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables\nin these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using\ntools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a\nHamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes\nor relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for\na quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining\nwhether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value\nis PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is\nexpected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the\nproblem of determining whether the system thermalizes is contained in PSPACE\nand is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions.

Our results indicate that a coupled\noscillator system can exhibit significant quantum coherence in the ultrastrong\nand deep strong coupling regimes. In the ground state, the photon-mode and the\nmatter-mode coherences are equal. The larger coherences that encompass the\nphoton mode, the matter mode, and the overall system are achieved at lower\noptical frequencies and with increased coupling strengths. Notably, the the\nbeam-splitter and phase rotation terms alone does not generate coherences for\neither total coherence or subsystem coherences; instead, the generation of\nquantum coherences originates from the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms.\nWhen heat environments are present, the total coherence can be enhanced by the\nthe beam-splitter and phase rotation terms, while it has no effect on subsystem\ncoherences. Moreover, when the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms and the\nthe beam-splitter and phase rotation terms are considered together, the total\ncoherence increases with stronger coupling.

The KZ protocol starts at\ntime $t_i<0$ from the negatively magnetized ground state for $h_i = t_i/t_s<0$.\nThen, the system evolves unitarily up to a time $t_f > 0$, such that the\nmagnetization of the state at time $t_f$ is positive. In finite-size systems,\nthe KZ dynamics develops out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS)\nbehaviors. Their scaling variables depend either exponentially or with a power\nlaw on the size, depending on the boundary conditions (BC). The OFSS functions\ncan be computed in effective models restricted to appropriate low-energy\n(magnetized and/or kink) states. The KZ scaling behavior drastically changes in\nthe thermodynamic limit (TL), defined as the infinite-size limit keeping $t$\nand $t_s$ fixed, which appears substantially unrelated with the OFSS regime,\nbecause it involves higher-energy multi-kink states, which are irrelevant in\nthe OFSS limit. The numerical analyses of the KZ dynamics in the TL show the\nemergence of a quantum spinodal-like scaling behavior at the FOQTs for all\nconsidered BC, which is independent of the BC. The longitudinal magnetization\nchanges sign at $h(t)=h*>0$, where $h*$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, as\n$h*\\sim 1/\\ln t_s$. Moreover, in the large-$t_s$ limit, the time-dependence of\nthe magnetization is described by a universal function of $\\Omega = t/\\tau_s$,\nwith $\\tau_s = t_s/\\ln t_s$."}

Depending on the values of the\nboundary fields, the system exhibits several phases which can be categorized\nbased on the ground state exhibited by the system and also based on the number\nof bound states localized at the boundaries. We show that the Hilbert space is\ncomprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of\nboundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary\nphase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical\nvalues. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the\nground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the\n`Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space\nchanges, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary\nbound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization\ntechniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the\nground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each\neigenstate."}

Strikingly, the quadratic\ndispersion leads to the occurrence of (fractional) revivals, similar to those\nseen in the optical Talbot effect or the so-called quantum carpets.

We show that given mild\nconditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which\nmust be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further\nelucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths,\n`pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily\nevolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been\nstudied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We\nconstruct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry\ngroups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we\nfind examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still\nentangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the\nnon-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between\nthese RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in\nHamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying\nthe Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This\nadditional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase\ndiagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the\nOnsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT\nexample. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group\ncohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above\nin the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the\ninvariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain\nSPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are\nnot manifolds."}
