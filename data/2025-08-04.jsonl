Shadow\ntomography allows for efficient reconstruction of expectation values of\narbitrary observables from a bag of repeated, randomized measurements, called\nsnapshots, on copies of the state $\\rho$. The prescription allows one to infer\nexpectation values of $M$ $k-$local observables to accuracy $\\epsilon$ using\njust $N \\sim 3^k \\text{log}M /\\epsilon^2$ snapshots when measurements are\nperformed in locally random bases. Turning this around, a bag of snapshots can\nbe considered an efficient representation of the state $\\rho$, particularly for\nestimating low-weight observables, such as terms in a local Hamiltonian needed\nto estimate the energy. Inspired by this, we consider a variational scheme\nwherein a bag of $N$ parametrized snapshots is used to represent the putative\nground state of a desired local spin Hamiltonian and optimized to lower the\nenergy with respect to it. Additional constraints in the form of positivity of\nreduced density matrices, motivated by work in quantum chemistry, are employed\nto ensure compatibility of the predicted correlations with the underlying\nHilbert space. Unlike reduced density matrix approaches, learning the\nunderlying distribution of measurement outcomes allows one to further\ncorrelations beyond those in the constrained density matrix. We show, with\nnumerical results, that the proposed variational method can be parallelized, is\nefficiently simulable, and yields a more complete description of the ground\nstate."}

Traditionally, this capability is measured\nby the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated\nwhen a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states.\nHowever, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of\nentanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric --\nentangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement\ngenerated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted\nnature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework\nthat yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis reveals a\nfundamental and previously unexplored physics: enhancing entangling capability\ninevitably increases sensitivity, or bias, toward specific input states. By\nanalyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical\nEP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of\nentanglement generation can significantly differ depending on physical\nimplementation. Extending our framework to a class of generalized\ncontrolled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary\ndimensions, we (re)affirm the inherent trade-off between the entangling\nstrength and uniformity.

Indeed, we find the non-Markovianity to be negligible for\na single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing via interaction with a\nharmonic oscillator environment. In this paper, we examine a natural extension,\nnamely a pure dephasing model where a collection of two-level systems interacts\nwith a common environment. We obtain analytically the dynamics of the\ncollection of the two-level systems, and then take a partial trace over all the\ntwo-level systems except one. This remaining single two-level system is shown\nto display markedly non-Markovian dynamics, even in the weak system-environment\ncoupling regime. This is due to the indirect interaction between two-level\nsystems induced by their interaction with the common environment. In fact, this\nindirect interaction can not only increase the non-Markovianity by orders of\nmagnitude, but also display qualitatively different characteristics. For\ninstance, for a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing, the dynamics\nare Markovian for Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments.
