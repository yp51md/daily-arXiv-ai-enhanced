In contrast to the $S=1/2$ case, such higher-$S$ models\nare not exactly solvable and remain poorly understood, particularly for spin\nexcitations at finite temperatures. Here, we focus on the $S=1$ Kitaev model,\nwhich is proposed to host bosonic quasiparticles. We investigate this model\nusing Schwinger boson mean-field theory, introducing bosonic spinons as\nfractional quasiparticles by extending bond operators to address anisotropic\nspin interactions. We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a\nquantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models.\nBased on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure\nfactors. We find that the conventional scheme based on Wick decoupling with\nrespect to spinons yields unphysical momentum dependence: it produces strong\nspectral weight indicating ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) correlations in\nthe antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Kitaev model. To resolve this issue, we\npropose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond\noperators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior\ndisappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is\nconsistent with the sign of the exchange constant. We also compute the\ntemperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor and find that the\nzero-temperature continuum splits into two distinct structures as temperature\nincreases, which can be understood in terms of the bandwidth narrowing of\nspinons. Finally, we clarify why the two decoupling schemes result in different\nmomentum dependences and discuss their relationship to previous studies."}

Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a\nphase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called\n$\\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a\nholographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator\nremains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body\nsystem. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related\nconcept of $\\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a\nphase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding\nis a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding\nunder two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and\nsize bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and\n(ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\\lambda_L \\leq 2\n\\alpha$ (with $\\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\\alpha$ the growth rate),\nwhich ensures a linear phase dependence on size. For systems which do not\nsaturate this bound, with $h = \\lambda_L / 2\\alpha <1$, the winding with Pauli\nsize $\\ell$ becomes $\\textit{superlinear}$, behaving as $\\ell^{1/h}$.

We\nhighlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications\nin discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear\nSystems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive\ntasks on emerging quantum hardware."}

After\npresenting this result in a more detailed way, reinforcing its topological\nnature, we study the magnetic and electric versions of the AB effect in\ndifferent inertial reference frames. We find a particular reference frame for a\nmagnetic AB effect where the magnetic flux has a null contribution for the AB\nphase difference, which is entirely due to an electric flux. Also, we find a\nparticular reference frame for an electric AB effect where the electric flux\nhas a null contribution for the AB phase difference, which is entirely due to a\nmagnetic flux. In this sense, the nomenclatures 'magnetic AB effect' and\n'electric AB effect' lose their meaning. We have electromagnetic AB effects."}

This article is an invited contribution to Roadmap\n  on Attosecond Science by Journal of Optics", "summary": "In its beginnings, the physics of intense laser-matter interactions was the\nphysics of multiphoton processes. The theory was reduced then to high-order\nperturbation theory, while treating matter and light in a quantum manner. With\nthe advent of chirped pulse amplification developed by D. Strickland and G.\nMourou, which enabled generation of ultra-intense, ultra-short, coherent laser\npulses, the need for a quantum electrodynamics description of electromagnetic\n(EM) fields practically ceased to exist and lost relevance. Contemporary\nattoscience (AS), and more generally ultrafast laser physics, awarded the Nobel\nPrize in 2023 to P. Agostini, F. Krausz, and A. L'Huillier, commonly uses the\nclassical description of EM fields while keeping a fully quantum description of\nmatter. The progress and successes of AS in the last 40 years have been\nspectacular, with an enormous amount of fascinating investigations in basic\nresearch and technology. Yet a central question remains: can ultrafast laser\nphysics continue to advance without reintroducing quantum electrodynamics and\nquantum optics into its description of light-matter interactions? This article\ndiscusses future perspectives at the intersection of strong-field physics and\nquantum optics."}

Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity,\nmutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and\nself-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal\nentanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be\ncapable of detecting the first-order and $\\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ\nmodel, as well as the Ising and $\\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In\naddition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the\nBeresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed\nthrough concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably,\nthe critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional\npoints as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases.

Exploring this\ninterplay is essential to understand how strong interactions and dissipation\ncollectively shape topological phases in open quantum systems. Here, we\nexperimentally demonstrate non-Hermitian spectra topology in a dissipative\nRydberg atomic gas and characterize parameters-dependent winding numbers. By\nincreasing the interaction strength, the system evolves from Hermitian to\nnon-Hermitian regime, accompanying emergence of trajectory loop in the complex\nenergy plane. As the scanning time is varied, the spectra topology becomes\ntwisted in the complex energy plane manifesting as a topology phase transition\nwith the sign winding number changed. When preparing the system in different\ninitial states, we can access a nontrivial fractional phase within a parameter\nspace that globally possesses an integer winding. Furthermore, by changing the\nscanning direction, we observe the differentiated loops, revealing the breaking\nof chirality symmetry. This work establishes cold Rydberg gases as a versatile\nplatform for exploring the rich interplay between non-Hermitian topology,\nstrong interactions, and dissipative quantum dynamics."}

We find\nthat in the limit of weak inter-chain coupling, such a coupled system exhibits\ntransitions from delocalized to intermediate phase with increase in the\nnon-Hermiticity parameter. However, for stronger inter-chain coupling\nstrengths, the delocalized phase undergoes a transition to localized phase and\nthen to an intermediate phase. Interestingly, the intermediate phase in this\ncase exhibits the non-Hermitian comb effect (NHCE), i.e., the coexistence of\nlocalized and extended states rather than being well separated from each other\nby any mobility edge which is conventional in any intermediate phase. We\nfurther show that such a NHCE originates from the isolated site limit of the\nquasiperiodic chain and provide an analytical explanation supporting the\nnumerical signatures."}

While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward\nas a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum\ncritical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely\nunexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum\ncritical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of\nsuperradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the\ntransition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is\naccompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a\nparticularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state,\nand point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies\nphoton-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological\nperformance."}
