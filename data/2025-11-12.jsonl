The intersection of all valid Bell inequalities is the so-called local polytope. In multipartite systems, characterizing the local polytope quickly becomes an intractable task as the system size increases. Optimizing Bell inequalities to maximize the ratio between their quantum value and classical bound is key to understanding multipartite nonlocality. We propose a gradient-based method for this optimization. Numerical results indicate that local maxima of this ratio typically correspond to facet Bell inequalities of the local polytope. This enables an iterative search for tight and robust Bell inequalities. Applied to permutation-invariant scenarios, the method provides tight Bell inequalities with large quantum violations and facilitates experimental certification of Bell correlations without full knowledge of the local polytope."}

In this work we show that, beyond qualitative detection, a family of well-defined measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement can be obtained with symmetry tests. We propose and benchmark several efficient methods to estimate these measures, and derive near-optimal sampling strategies for each. Despite the nonlinearity of the methods, we demonstrate that the sampling error scales no worse than $O(N_{\\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/2})$ with the total number of copies $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, which suggests experimental feasibility. By exploiting symmetries we compute our measures for large number of copies, and derive the asymptotic decay exponents for relevant states in many-body systems. Using these results we identify tradeoffs between estimation complexity and sensitivity of the presented entanglement measures, oriented to practical implementations."}

These results show a systematic and evident influence on $α$. We assess the non-Gaussianity and non-classicality measures, quantifying their nonlinearity and quantum behavior. In particular, we discover that both metrics rise monotonically with $α$. Furthermore, we examine the metrological performance for estimating $α$. By calculating the pertinent Fisher information and building workable estimators, we show that optimal strategies can saturate the Cramér-Rao bound, with straightforward position measurements on shallow wells already producing high precision.

We perform a significant step forward by demonstrating that these features are robust under generic long-wavelength random initial conditions. By employing advanced probabilistic techniques inspired by the works of Dudley and Talagrand, we derive a sharp asymptotic expression for the average shock time in the thermodynamic limit. For large $p$, this time scales as $(p \\sqrt{\\log p})^{-1}$, where $p$ is the number of excited modes proving that it is an intensive quantity up to a logarithmic correction in the size of the system."}

Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics."}

We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes.

In this study, we present a classical data-traceable quantum oracle characterized by a circuit depth that increases linearly with the number of qubits. This configuration facilitates the learning of approximate result patterns through a shallow quantum circuit (SQC) layout.

This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out\" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits."}

Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions. The excitation of resonant modes in the superparticle enhances the emission intensity and reduces the degree of its backward asymmetry. Furthermore, coating the CdS quantum dot particle with a silicon dioxide layer increases the probability of exciting field resonances in such a core-shell superparticle."}

Heat capacity shows a sharp lambda-type transition at T_N, associated with the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of Cr, followed by a broad feature near 9 K. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) establishes the Pn'm'a (Gamma2) magnetic structure below T_N. A gradual change in magnetic structure occurs during the spin-reorientation (SRO) transition below 30 K, where the magnetic symmetry transforms from Pn'm'a (Gamma2) to Pn'ma' (Gamma4) phase. However, below the SRO, neither Gamma2 nor Gamma4 alone adequately fit the intensity of magnetic reflections. A satisfactory refinement is achieved using the monoclinic subgroup P21'/c', derived from a combination of Gamma2 and Gamma4. The gradual SRO of Tm and Cr moments across the compensation regime is consistent with the magnetic symmetry P21'/c'.

We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs."}

Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($>1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient.

Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint. Our results establish rare-earth local moment spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of subtle broken symmetries and highlight an unexpected interplay between kagome magnetism and rare-earth local moment magnetism."}

Rooted in the inviolable fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, QSDC enables ultrasensitive detection of even the faintest eavesdropping attempts, guaranteeing true communication security solely when no interference exists. If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber. However, its practical scalability remains constrained by insufficient transmission rates, a critical bottleneck. Semantic communication, which drastically boosts transmission efficiency by extracting core information features, nevertheless stays vulnerable to malicious intrusions. Integrating these paradigms promises to simultaneously enhance equivalent data rate and security. Herein, we propose and experimentally validate a quantum semantic communication scheme, applying it to 3D point clouds. It achieves a 46.30-fold efficiency gain over direct transmission, surpassing both Wyner and Shannon capacity limits. This breakthrough not only clears the path for large-scale QSDC deployment but also marks a pivotal milestone in quantum information science."}

While previous studies have shown that higher-order hopping or constrained quasiperiodic potentials can induce a mixed-phase zone in one dimension, we demonstrate that the dissipation can induce mixed phase zone in a one dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing any explicit constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping param- eter. Our approach exploits an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, valid for quadratic fermionic systems un- der linear dissipation. Using third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, we analyze two dissipation configurations: alternating gain and loss at every site, and at alternate sites under balanced and imbalanced conditions. By computing the inverse and normalized partici- pation ratios, we show that dissipation can drive the system into three distinct phases: delocalizd, mixed, and localized. Notably, the mixed-phase zone is absent for balanced dissipation at every site but emerges upon introducing imbalance, while for alternate site dissipation it appears in both balanced and imbalanced cases. Furthermore, the critical points and the width of the mixed-phase window can be selectively tuned by varying the dissipation strength. These findings reveal that the dissipation plays a decisive role in reshaping localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems, offering new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic order."}

It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $ω/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity.

Nearly untwinned high-quality single crystals reveal the intrinsic in-plane anisotropy: the in-plane easy axis saturates at $M_{\\text{easy}}(4~\\text{T}) \\approx 1.8~μ_{\\text{B}}$/Ce, while the in-plane hard axis magnetization is strongly suppressed, nearly linear, and comparable to the out-of-plane response.

We find that collective effects dramatically alter the interplay of electronic, vibrational and cavity angular momenta, giving rise to markedly different polaritonic spectra and dynamics even when going from one to two JT molecules. Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system. Our results uncover new pathways for vibronic angular momentum transfer unique to collective molecular polaritonics with potential implications for cavity-assisted photo-physics and photo-chemistry."}

While previous studies have primarily focused on magic in single systems, its interactions and distribution in multipartite settings remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce mutual mana as a measure of magic correlations defined in close analogy with quantum mutual information. Our definition builds upon mana, which is the established quantifier of magic based on discrete Wigner function negativity. We characterize magic correlations generated by discrete beamsplitters, whose Gaussian counterparts are fundamental components in quantum optics and quantum technologies. We show that coupling a magic state with a stabilizer vacuum state via a discrete beamsplitter will induce a full conversion of local magic into mutual mana, thereby establishing a mechanism for redistributing magic resources as magic correlations. We reveal the fundamental properties of mutual mana and derive its explicit expressions for several prototypical qutrit states subject to a discrete beamsplitter. We make a comparative study of mutual mana with several established quantifiers of correlations generated by the qutrit beamsplitter, including quantum mutual information, mutual $L^1$-norm magic, and mutual stabilizer 2-Rényi entropy."}

Our coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) scheme offers a broadband cancellation capability with a tunable, wavelength-flexible, and compact system. This is achieved through the implementation of an optical equivalent of an opto-mechanical interaction, facilitated by a down-conversion and a beam-splitting process. The intricate nature of the system and its multiple interacting components made characterizing the interdependent parameters with conventional methods ineffective, leading to the development of an in-situ characterization scheme. The obtained parameters meet the targets for CQNC set in previous studies. With our current realization, we project a broadband quantum noise reduction of 3.6 dB, corresponding to a 77% reduction in quantum back-action noise at the optimal frequency of maximum reduction, indicating the readiness of the ENMO for application. We discuss the prospects for new applications in quantum information and communication using the same platform."}

Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave. We dub this property a \\textit{Meissner polariton}, that is, a collective mode resulting from the hybridization of light with order parameter oscillations. Furthermore, near the onset of symmetry breaking, strong fluctuations give rise to a superconducting-like response even in the absence of a Meissner effect or of a Meissner polariton. Our results are relevant to experiments on light-induced orders, particularly superconductivity."}

Although such phenomena have been demonstrated in non-equilibrium settings, their use for fluctuation engineering has been put forth in Raman-cavity hybrids only recently. In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions, as demonstrated here, could be leveraged for the design of novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime."}

Fundamental interactions are either extremely short-range or decay inversely with the separation distance, such as the Coulomb potential between charges or the gravitational attraction between masses. In contrast, emergent quantum van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions decay considerably faster ($R^{-6}$ or $R^{-7}$) with distance $R$. Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales."}

This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out\" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits."}

If an efficient gate sequence for an operation is unknown, one often employs layered parameterized quantum circuits, especially hardware-efficient ansätze, with fixed entangling layer structures. We demonstrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve on these by optimizing the entangling gate sequence in the task of quantum state preparation. This allows us to restrict the required number of CNOT gates while taking the qubit connectivity architecture into account. Recent advancements using reinforcement learning have already demonstrated the power of this technique when optimizing the circuit for a sequence of non-parameterized gates. We extend this approach to parameterized gate sets by incorporating general single-qubit unitaries, thus allowing us to consistently reach higher state preparation fidelities at the same number of CNOT gates compared to a hardware-efficient ansatz."}

However, advances in this field often rely on simplifying assumptions regarding the quantum light's generation and its source. In this work, we relax some of these assumptions and probe the behavior of entangled photon pairs passing through a disordered layer after being generated by a randomly scattered pump via spontaneous parametric down conversion. We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium. These findings represent a crucial step toward understanding quantum light generation in complex media, and potentially exploiting it for quantum technologies."}

Transition operators are compiled into block-encoded circuits and iterated using fixed-point oblivious amplitude amplification, and amplitude-encoded marginals are used to estimate the classical push-forward. Empirically, colour categories such as black and, to a lesser extent, white function as high-degree hubs that dominate probability flow. Consequently, we assess three chain variants: the full network including all colours, a network without black, and a network without black and white, to quantify the effect of hub pruning under realistic circuit depths and measurement budgets. Across networks aggregated from multiple retailers, hub pruning consistently improves quantum and classical agreement at shallow depth; total-variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence typically decrease by approximately a factor of two relative to the full network, while state fidelities remain close to unity. A bias-and-contraction analysis explains these gains through reduced cross-terms and an effectively widened spectral gap. The results identify hub-pruned block-encodings as a practical heuristic for near-term experiments on recommendation dynamics using small quantum registers, and they provide a reproducible benchmarking protocol that reports total-variation distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and state fidelity as functions of circuit depth and prediction horizon."}

In experiments on the Iris dataset, the refined hybrid model improved accuracy from 0.31 in the classical approach to 0.87 in the quantum approach.

Being formally equivalent to the solution of the MB Schrödinger equation, EF sets up a strategy for the construction of efficient approximations in the theory of the correlated electronic-nuclear motion. Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\\citet{Yin-92}). From an intuitive argument that the atom must not be deflected by the Lorentz force from a straight line trajectory, it has been conjectured that the same compensation should occur within the EF theory as well. We give a rigorous proof of this property."}

A natural generalization of this property is to consider whether a notion of maximal entanglement is possible among all states with the same spectrum (where the aforementioned case of pure states corresponds to the particular choice in which the spectrum is a delta distribution, i.e., rank-1 states). Despite positive evidence in the past that such a notion might exist at least in the case of two-qubit states, it was recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 050202 (2024)] that the answer to the above question is negative. This reference proved this for particular choices of the spectrum in the case of rank-2 two-qubit density matrices. While this settles the problem in general, it still leaves open whether there are other choices of the spectrum outside the case of pure states where a maximally entangled state for a fixed spectrum might exist. In this work we extend this impossibility result to all rank-2 and rank-3 two-qubit states as well as for a large class of eigenvalue distributions in the case where the rank equals four."}

Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding"}

Angelakis"], "title": "An Information-Minimal Geometry for Qubit-Efficient Optimization", "comment": "39 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Qubit-efficient optimization seeks to represent an $N$-variable combinatorial problem within a Hilbert space smaller than $2^N$, using only as much quantum structure as the objective itself requires. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\\lceil\\log_2 N\\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \\approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary."}

TNs are particularly suitable for one-dimensional local Hamiltonians, while their performance for generic geometries is mainly limited by two aspects: the limitation in expressive power and the approximate extraction of information. Here we investigate the performance of superposition-of-product-states (SPS) ansatz, a variational framework structurally related to canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. The ansatz does not compress information as effectively as tensor networks, but it has the advantages (i) of allowing accurate extraction of information, (ii) of being structurally independent of the geometry of the system, (iii) of being readily parallelizable, and (iv) of allowing analytical shortcuts. We first study the typical properties of the SPS ansatz for spin-$1/2$ systems, including its entanglement entropy, and its trainability. We then use this ansatz for ground state search in tilted Ising models--including one-dimensional and three-dimensional with short- and long-range interaction, and a random network--demonstrating that SPS can attain high accuracy."}

Fourier transforming exponentially decaying time domain signals gives Lorentzian line shapes which can be manipulated by apodization methods. The underlying transitions of spectral lines can be visualized by a Bloch vector or equivalent phase-space representations. Here, we study and generalize a surprisingly elegant geometric transform, the hyperbolism of curves originally found by Isaac Newton, which allows to transform ellipses into Lorentzian lines, and vice versa. With this, we show that the Bloch picture and especially corresponding phase-space representations are directly geometrically related to the Lorentzian line shape. We also introduce a novel continuous parametrization of Newton's transform which results in further interesting line shapes. In particular, we find that truncated parabolic lines with finite support can be obtained by the half transform and introduce a new apodization approach to replicate this line shape in experimental spectra.

This approach is contrasted with a numerically optimized gate designed using the Boulder Opal platform. The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities while demonstrating robustness against errors similar to that of the effective counterdiabatic gate. The study serves as an example of the performance of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols compared to brute-force numerical optimization techniques for state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms. It stresses the important role played by constraints on the optimized pulses in time and in amplitude that are crucial in determining the quality of the optimization method."}

We introduce an attenuation-resistant sufficient criterion for quantum non-Gaussian states based on the second- and third-order correlation functions, $g^{(2)}$ and $g^{(3)}$. The general non-linear bound for classical mixtures of Gaussian states is $\\sqrt{g^{(3)}} + 3 \\sqrt{g^{(2)}} \\geq 2$.

The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size. This work thus enables a new paradigm: a quantum computer that learns to self-improve directly from its errors and never stops computing."}

This is particularly true when we focus on highly-constrained early fault-tolerant devices. Many attempts to optimize algorithms for early fault-tolerance focus on simple metrics, such as the circuit depth or T-count. These metrics fail to capture critical overheads, such as the spacetime cost of Clifford operations and routing, or miss they key optimizations. We propose the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, tailored for architectures that use a two-dimensional lattice of qubits to implement the two-dimensional surface code. FLASQ abstracts away the complexity of routing by assuming that ancilla space and time can be fluidly rearranged, allowing for the tractable estimation of spacetime volume while still capturing important details neglected by simpler approaches. At the same time, it enforces constraints imposed by the circuit's measurement depth and the processor's reaction time. We apply FLASQ to analyze the cost of a standard two-dimensional lattice model simulation, finding that modern advances (such as magic state cultivation and the combination of quantum error correction and mitigation) reduce both the time and space required for this task by an order of magnitude compared with previous estimates. We also analyze the Hamming weight phasing approach to synthesizing parallel rotations, revealing that despite its low T-count, the overhead from imposing a 2D layout and from its use of additional ancilla qubits will make it challenging to benefit from in early fault-tolerance. We hope that the FLASQ cost model will help to better align early fault-tolerant algorithmic design with actual hardware realization costs without demanding excessive knowledge of quantum error correction from quantum algorithmists."}

We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs."}

Encompassing both all-pass and add-drop geometries, identical and distinct pump and biphoton coupling coefficients, and continuous-wave and pulsed pumping, our interaction-picture-based approach reveals time-frequency biphoton correlations while also predicting absolute generation rates. Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings.

In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions, as demonstrated here, could be leveraged for the design of novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime."}
