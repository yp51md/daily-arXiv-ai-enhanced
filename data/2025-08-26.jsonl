It is\nusually derived from the von Neumann equation for a large system, at given\nphysical conditions, when a small subsystem is explicitly singled out and the\nrest of the system acts as an environment whose degrees of freedom are traced\nout. In the specific case of a subsystem with variable particle number, the\nequilibrium density operator is given by the well-known grand canonical Gibbs\nstate. Consequently, solving the Lindblad equation in this case should\nautomatically yield, without any additional assumptions, the corresponding\ndensity operator in the limiting case of statistical equilibrium. Current\nstudies of the Lindblad equation with varying particle number assume, however,\nthe grand canonical Gibbs state a priori: the chemical potential is externally\nimposed rather than derived from first principles, and hence the corresponding\ndensity operator is not obtained as a natural solution of the equation. In this\nwork, we investigate the compatibility of grand canonical statistical mechanics\nwith the derivation of the Lindblad equation. We propose an alternative and\ncomplementary approach to the current literature that consists in using a\ngeneralized system Hamiltonian which includes a term $\\mu N$. In a previous\npaper, this empirically well-known term has been formally derived from the von\nNeumann equation for the specific case of equilibrium. Including $\\mu N$ in the\nsystem Hamiltonian leads to a modified Lindblad equation which yields the grand\ncanonical state as a natural solution, meaning that all the quantities involved\nare obtained from the physics of the system without any external assumptions."}

While entanglement is\nhindered by thermalization when the system and environment exchange a conserved\nquantity, we demonstrate that breaking this conservation law through the\nsystem-environment interaction drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady\nstate. Such an interaction will generate multiple competing equilibration\nchannels, effectively mimicking baths at distinct chemical potentials. When the\nenvironment also supports long-range correlations, these channels mediate\nnonlocal dissipation capable of generating entanglement. We illustrate the\nscheme in a model of two color centers weakly coupled to a spin-pumped magnet,\nwhere tuneable magnon excitations enable steady-state entanglement over finite\ndistances. Our results outline a scalable approach to dissipative entanglement\ngeneration, rooted in the conservation structure and environmental correlations\nrather than fine-tuned coherent control or active driving."}

Quantum computers are a\npromising platform to simulate the dynamics of open quantum systems aided by\nintrinsic hardware-noise, with successful demonstrations of models with two\nelectronic sites. We simulated a microscopic model of electron-transfer (ET)\nwith a single donor and up to nine acceptor sites on a superconducting\nprocessor of IBM, using a model-specific error mitigation scheme. Our results\nusing up to 20 qubits reveal a probability of ET that is well aligned with\nclassical calculations where electronic and vibronic transfer resonances can be\nidentified at the expected driving forces. We conducted 10 independent\nexperiments per system size on different days, accounting for hourly\nfluctuations in error rates. We find that the most important ingredient for\nlarge-scale simulations is a large number of available qubits connected by\nhigh-fidelity gates, with coherence times above the threshold set by the target\nopen system. Because the vibronic mechanism of electron transfer is\nentanglement-driven, our simulation is a natural application-based benchmark,\nin which the hardware capacity to produce and sustain entanglement is\nquantified by the maximum system size for which the hardware produces accurate\nresults."}

Mapping this challenge onto a graph-based problem,\nspecifically the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, allows it to\nbe addressed by specialized hardware such as neutral-atom quantum processors.\nHowever, a significant bottleneck has been the size mismatch between\nbiologically relevant molecular systems and the limited capacity of near-term\nquantum devices. In this work, we overcome this scaling limitation by the use\nof a novel divide-and-conquer heuristic introduced in Cazals et al. This\nalgorithm enables the solution of large-scale MWIS problems by decomposing a\nsingle, intractable graph instance into smaller sub-problems that can be solved\nsequentially on a neutral-atom quantum emulator, incurring only a linear\ncomputational overhead. We demonstrate the power of this approach by solving a\n540-node MWIS problem representing the docking of an inhibitor to the Tumor\nnecrosis factor-$\\alpha$ Converting Enzyme--thiol-containing Aryl Sulfonamide\n(TACE-AS) complex.

It explores how the\ndiscarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum\nconvolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical\nclassifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit\nstates after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain\nentangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is\nlost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the\nconventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a\nhybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully\nconnected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately\nprocess measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are\nensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a\nclassical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to\nadapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on\nMNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing\ndiscarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid\nquantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification."}

The INS reveals\ntwo distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at\n10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory\nusing SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that\nBa5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions\nbetween neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and\nstrong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in\ncontrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these\nmagnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above\nTN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is\nfurther supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the\ninitial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified\nthrough maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a\ndynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy\nwithin the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different\nhybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure.

The building blocks are basic spin-exchange interactions\ncombined with locally selective Floquet pulses, a capability recently\ndemonstrated in a range of experimental platforms. The resulting flip-flip and\nflop-flop terms lead to intriguing quantum transport dynamics beyond\nconventional spin models. For instance, in the absence of a magnetic field,\nspin excitations polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes propagate chirally in\nopposite directions, producing polarization-dependent spin transport. In the\nlarge-spin limit, the spin Kitaev model maps to a nonlinear Hatano-Nelson\nmodel, where the interplay of nonlinearity and the underlying curvature yields\npolarization-dependent chiral solitons. A magnetic field binds two oppositely\npolarized chiral solitons into a chiral solitonic molecule, whose travel\ndirection depends on its orientation.

By means of numerical simulations and full counting\nstatistics, we determine the power laws of both the spin polarization transfer\nand contrast cumulants for different kinds of helix and domain-wall initial\nstates.
