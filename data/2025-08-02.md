### [1] [Reformulating Chemical Equilibrium in Reacting Quantum Gas Mixtures: Particle Number Conservation, Correlations and Fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23132)
*Diogo J. L. Rodrigues*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文重新表述了量子气体混合物的正则系综描述，通过引入一个全局粒子数守恒约束，替代传统的化学势相等条件，揭示了自旋统计相同的物种间的费米-狄拉克或玻色-爱因斯坦关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理量子气体混合物时依赖化学势相等条件，无法充分描述物种间的关联和浓度波动。本文旨在通过新的约束条件更全面地描述量子化学平衡。

Method: 引入全局粒子数守恒约束，嵌入所有通过转换路径连接的微观状态，扩展配分函数以包含浓度波动。

Result: 揭示了物种间因相同自旋统计而产生的量子关联，并展示了在经典理想气体极限下的平滑过渡。

Conclusion: 新框架为理解具有浓度波动的量子化学平衡提供了新视角，并推广了经典化学平衡处理方法。

Abstract: The canonical-ensemble description of reactive quantum gas mixtures is
reformulated by incorporating a single global particle-number-conservation
constraint over the combined spectra of inter-converting species. This
constraint replaces the conventional equality of chemical potentials.
Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein correlations naturally emerge across one-particle
energy eigenstates of species sharing identical spin-statistics, which in
ergodic single-systems manifest as intrinsic features of the equilibrium state.
By embedding all microstates linked by conversion pathways, the framework
incorporates concentration fluctuations in the statistical description. The
formalism offers fresh insights into quantum chemical equilibrium in reactive
mixtures with composition fluctuations and smoothly reduces to the classical
ideal gas limit via an extended partition function that generalizes classical
chemical-equilibrium treatments.

Conclusion: 动态冻结不仅为热化失效提供了新机制，还为量子计量学提供了新工具。

Abstract: Understanding and controlling non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body
systems is a fundamental challenge in modern physics, with profound
implications for advancing quantum technologies. Typically, periodically driven
systems in the absence of conservation laws thermalize to a featureless
"infinite-temperature" state, erasing all memory of their initial conditions.
However, this paradigm can break down through mechanisms such as integrability,
many-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and Hilbert space
fragmentation. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical
freezing, a distinct mechanism of thermalization breakdown in driven systems,
and demonstrate its application in quantum sensing using an ensemble of
approximately $10^4$ interacting nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond. By
precisely controlling the driving frequency and detuning, we observe emergent
long-lived spin magnetization and coherent oscillatory micromotions, persisting
over timescales exceeding the interaction-limited coherence time ($T_2$) by
more than an order of magnitude. Leveraging these unconventional dynamics, we
develop a dynamical-freezing-enhanced ac magnetometry that extends optimal
sensing times far beyond $T_2$, outperforming conventional dynamical decoupling
magnetometry with a 4.3 dB sensitivity enhancement. Our results not only
provide clear experimental observation of dynamical freezing -- a peculiar
mechanism defying thermalization through emergent conservation laws -- but also
establish a robust control method generally applicable to diverse physical
platforms, with broad implications in quantum metrology and beyond.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子疤痕态如何影响子系统动力学的非马尔可夫性，揭示其与热化过程的关系。

Result: 量子疤痕态的存在显著增强了子系统的非马尔可夫性，而疤痕态消除变形则减弱了这种效应。

Conclusion: 量子疤痕态为研究远离平衡态和非热化的量子多体系统提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Given that any subsystem of a closed out-of-equilibrium quantum system is an
open quantum system, its dynamics (reduced from the full system's unitary
evolution) can be either Markovian (memory-less) or non-Markovian, with the
latter necessarily impeding the process of relaxation and thermalization.
Seemingly independently, such non-ergodic dynamics occurs when an initial state
has spectral weight on the so-called quantum scar states, which are
non-thermalizing states embedded deep in the spectrum of otherwise thermal
states. In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of
quantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances
non-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP
model and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of
scarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to
have significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing
information backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between
temporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of
subsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that
scarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished)
subsystem non-Markovianity. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories
associated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the
interface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to
investigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum
many-body systems.

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏一个全面的框架来处理场数字化（FD）中的无限自由度截断问题，特别是在获取连续极限结果时。

Method: 将FD参数N视为重整化群耦合，利用有效场理论和RG推导广义标度假说，并通过数值张量网络计算验证。

Result: 揭示了有限N诱导的低温相变附近的非传统普适交叉行为，并证明了2D经典模型与(2+1)D量子模型的直接联系。

Conclusion: FDS为分析复杂量子场理论的连续极限提供了新工具，尤其在更高维度的量子模拟中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum,
requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the
context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$
discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is
currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter
$N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example,
we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field
theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the
FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different
$N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\textit{field digitization
scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond
dimension $\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover
around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating
that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\chi$ and $N$. Finally,
we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the
ground state of a (2+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a
FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for
applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher
spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum
limit of digitized quantum field theories.

### [5] [Proximity-measurement induced random localization in quantum fluids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23085)

Method: 通过分析随机邻近测量对量子流体的作用，研究粒子局域化现象及其分布规律。

Result: 测量导致部分粒子随机局域化，宏观均匀性保留；最终所有粒子局域化，局域化长度分布由测量速率决定。

Conclusion: 后选择随机邻近测量诱导量子流体中粒子局域化，局域化长度分布具有特定标度形式。

Abstract: Proximity measurements probe whether pairs of particles are close to one
another. We consider the impact of post-selected random proximity measurements
on a quantum fluid of many distinguishable particles. We show that such
measurements induce random spatial localization of a fraction of the particles,
and yet preserve homogeneity macroscopically. Eventually, all particles
localize, with a distribution of localization lengths that saturates at a scale
controlled by the typical measurement rate. The steady-state distribution of
these lengths is governed by a familiar scaling form.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了连续拟概率分布在无限测度空间上的majorization概念，推广了Hardy等人的经典定理，并证明了四种定义的等价性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拟概率分布对量子力学等领域至关重要，但传统majorization理论仅适用于概率分布，因此需要扩展。

Result: 提出了新的资源单调性和量子态转换的no-go定理，并以Wigner函数为例展示了应用。

Conclusion: 该研究为无限测度空间上的可积函数提供了广泛的majorization框架。

Abstract: Majorization theory is a powerful mathematical tool to compare the disorder
in distributions, with wide-ranging applications in many fields including
mathematics, physics, information theory, and economics. While majorization
theory typically focuses on probability distributions, quasiprobability
distributions provide a pivotal framework for advancing our understanding of
quantum mechanics, quantum information, and signal processing. Here, we
introduce a notion of majorization for continuous quasiprobability
distributions over infinite measure spaces. Generalizing a seminal theorem by
Hardy, Littlewood, and P\'olya, we prove the equivalence of four definitions
for both majorization and relative majorization in this setting. We give
several applications of our results in the context of quantum resource
theories, obtaining new families of resource monotones and no-goes for quantum
state conversions. A prominent example we explore is the Wigner function in
quantum optics. More generally, our results provide an extensive majorization
framework for assessing the disorder of integrable functions over infinite
measure spaces.

Result: 恶意代理可通过小部分节点初始化量子态并提取敏感结构信息。

Conclusion: 为量子互联网基础设施的入侵检测和结构诊断提供了新策略。

Abstract: We show that global properties of an unknown quantum network, such as the
average degree, hub density, and the number of closed paths of fixed length,
can be inferred from strictly local quantum measurements. In particular, we
demonstrate that a malicious agent with access to only a small subset of nodes
can initialize quantum states locally and, through repeated short-time
measurements, extract sensitive structural information about the entire
network. The intrusion strategy is inspired by extreme learning and quantum
reservoir computing and combines short-time quantum evolution with a
non-iterative linear readout with trainable weights. These results suggest new
strategies for intrusion detection and structural diagnostics in future quantum
Internet infrastructures.

Abstract: Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing response dynamics of
quantum many-body systems in and out-of-equilibrium. Quantum computers have
proved useful in simulating such experiments by exciting the system, evolving,
and then measuring observables to first order, all in one setting. Here, we use
this approach to investigate the mixed-field Ising model, where the
longitudinal field plays the role of a confining potential that prohibits the
spread of the excitations, spinons, or domain walls into space. We study the
discrete bound states that arise from such a setting and their evolution under
different quench dynamics by initially pumping the chain out of equilibrium and
then probing various non-equal time correlation functions. Finally, we study
false vacuum decay, where initially one expects unhindered propagation of the
ground state, or true vacuum, bubbles into the lattice, but instead sees the
emergence of Bloch oscillations that are directly the reason for the long-lived
oscillations in this finite-size model. Our work sets the stage for simulating
systems out-of-equilibrium on classical and quantum computers using pump-probe
experiments without needing ancillary qubits.

Conclusion: 结论是并行协议是实现量子互联网的有力候选方案，该框架为评估纠缠分发策略提供了可扩展工具。

Abstract: This work introduces a lightweight simulation framework for evaluating
asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models.
We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is
established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to
generate entanglement simultaneously. We evaluate the performance of each
protocol using two key metrics: the fidelity of distributed entangled states,
and the hashing rate, a measure of entanglement efficiency. These metrics are
compared between both protocols across a range of network sizes and noise
parameters. We demonstrate that the parallel protocol consistently outperforms
the sequential, particularly in the hashing rate metric due to reduced runtime,
suggesting that parallel protocols are a strong candidate for a realizable
quantum Internet. Our framework offers an accessible and scalable tool for
evaluating entanglement distribution strategies, by reducing the simulation of
complex quantum processes to simple memory time calculations.

Abstract: We show an explicit $N$-qubit protocol involving one-axis-twisted spin
squeezed states, that allows for simultaneous phase and dephasing strength
estimation with precision that asymptotically matches fundamental quantum
metrological bounds. The relevance of the protocol goes beyond this particular
model, since any uncorrelated noise quantum metrological model, that allows for
at most constant asymptotic quantum enhancement, can be reduced to this problem
via an appropriately tailored quantum error-correction procedure.

Abstract: Full reconstruction of quantum states from measurement samples is often a
prohibitively complex task, both in terms of the experimental setup and the
scaling of the sample size with the system. This motivates the relatively
easier task of certifying application-specific quantities using measurements
that are not tomographically complete, i.e. that provide only partial
information about the state related to the application of interest. Here, we
focus on simplifying the measurements needed to certify non-Gaussianity in
bosonic systems, a resource related to quantum advantage in various information
processing tasks. We show that the statistics of a single quadrature
measurement, corresponding to standard homodyne detection in quantum optics,
can witness arbitrary degrees of non-Gaussianity as quantified by stellar rank.
Our results are based on a version of Hudson's theorem for wavefunctions,
proved in a companion paper [1], revealing that the zeros in a homodyne
distribution are signatures of quantum non-Gaussianity and higher stellar
ranks. The validity of our witnesses is supported by a technical result showing
that sets of states with bounded energy and finite stellar rank are compact. We
provide an analysis of sample complexity, noise robustness, and experimental
prospects. Our work drastically simplifies the setup required to detect quantum
non-Gaussianity in bosonic quantum states. and experimental prospects. Our work
drastically simplifies the setup required to detect quantum non-Gaussianity in
bosonic quantum states.

Conclusion: 研究为未来量子系统的可扩展架构选择提供了依据，并推动了量子-经典协同设计的发展。

Abstract: Quantum State Tomography (QST) is essential for characterizing and validating
quantum systems, but its practical use is severely limited by the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space and the number of measurements required for
informational completeness. Many prior claims of performance have relied on
architectural assumptions rather than systematic validation. We benchmark
several neural network architectures to determine which scale effectively with
qubit number and which fail to maintain high fidelity as system size
increases.To address this, we perform a comprehensive benchmarking of diverse
neural architectures across two quantum measurement strategies to evaluate
their effectiveness in reconstructing both pure and mixed quantum states. Our
results reveal that CNN and CGAN scale more robustly and achieve the highest
fidelities, while Spiking Variational Autoencoder (SVAE) demonstrates moderate
fidelity performance, making it a strong candidate for embedded, low-power
hardware implementations.Recognizing that practical quantum diagnostics will
require embedded, energy-efficient computation, we also discuss how
memristor-based Computation-in-Memory (CiM) platforms can accelerate these
models in hardware, mitigating memory bottlenecks and reducing energy
consumption to enable scalable in-situ QST. This work identifies which
architectures scale favorably for future quantum systems and lays the
groundwork for quantum-classical co-design that is both computationally and
physically scalable.

Method: 开发了HAL算法，自动化优化QECC的布局和路由，并比较了多种QECC家族的硬件成本。

Result: 开放边界显著降低硬件成本，但逻辑效率有所下降；低权重径向码表现优异。

Conclusion: HAL为评估QECC硬件可行性和发现新码提供了框架。

Abstract: Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) with asymptotically lower overheads
than the surface code require non-local connectivity. Leveraging multi-layer
routing and long-range coupling capabilities in superconducting qubit hardware,
we develop Hardware-Aware Layout, HAL: a robust, runtime-efficient heuristic
algorithm that automates and optimizes the placement and routing of arbitrary
QECCs. Using HAL, we perform a comparative study of hardware cost across
various families of QECCs, including the bivariate bicycle codes, the
open-boundary tile codes, and the constant-depth-decodable radial codes. The
layouts produced by HAL confirm that open boundaries significantly reduce the
hardware cost, while incurring reductions in logical efficiency. Among the
best-performing codes were low-weight radial codes, despite lacking topological
structure. Overall, HAL provides a valuable framework for evaluating the
hardware feasibility of existing QECCs and guiding the discovery of new codes
compatible with realistic hardware constraints.

Conclusion: 该框架为量子计时提供了实验可实现的路径，并统一了不同系统的计时观测。

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for defining context-dependent time
distributions in quantum systems using projective measurements. The
time-of-flow (TF) distribution, derived from population transfer rates into a
measurement subspace, yields a time--energy uncertainty relation of the form
$\Delta \mathcal{T} \cdot \Delta H \geq \hbar / (6\sqrt{3}) \cdot
\delta\theta$, where $\delta\theta$ quantifies net population transfer. This
bound applies to arbitrary projectors under unitary dynamics and reveals that
time uncertainty is inherently measurement-dependent. We demonstrate the
framework with two applications: a general time-of-arrival (TOA)-energy
uncertainty relation and a driven three-level system under detuned coherent
driving. The TF framework unifies timing observables across spin, atomic, and
matter-wave systems, and offers an experimentally accessible route to probing
quantum timing in controlled measurements.

Result: 对于非阿贝尔电荷噪声和完美综合征测量，最优阈值为0.218(1)，而基于内在指示的最小权重完美匹配解码器阈值为0.20842(2)，优于标准方法的0.15860(1)。

Conclusion: 非阿贝尔特性可以提升拓扑序的稳定性，为未来实现容错量子计算提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Topological order (TO) provides a natural platform for storing and
manipulating quantum information. However, its stability to noise has only been
systematically understood for Abelian TOs. In this work, we exploit the
non-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error
correction and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag
qubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over
those of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian
anyon type. Furthermore, we present an approach for determining the optimal
threshold for non-Abelian TOs with perfect anyon syndromes for any noise model,
formulated as a statistical mechanics model using Bayesian inference. We
numerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \cong \mathbb Z_4 \rtimes \mathbb
Z_2$ TO. In particular, for non-Abelian charge noise and perfect syndrome
measurement, we find an optimal threshold $p_c=0.218(1)$, whereas an
intrinsically heralded minimal-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoder already
gives $p_c=0.20842(2)$, outperforming standard MWPM with $p_c = 0.15860(1)$.
Our work highlights how non-Abelian properties can enhance stability, rather
than reduce it, and discusses potential generalizations for achieving fault
tolerance.

thermodynamics. While the widely used Caldeira-Leggett master equation exhibits
desirable thermodynamic features, such as the fulfilment of a detailed balance,
it fails to ensure complete positivity. In contrast, several completely
positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) extensions turn out to be
thermodynamically controversial. We show that such extensions introduce
anomalous phase-space structures that violate detailed balance at the steady
state, leading to non-vanishing entropy production and effective
non-equilibrium current of unclear physical origins. Our results highlight a
fundamental tension between quantum consistency and thermodynamic equilibration
in open quantum systems.

Motivation: 为了在大型离子阱量子计算机中实现高效荧光收集，需要一种紧凑且可扩展的系统。

Abstract: A scaled trapped-ion quantum computer will require efficient fluorescence
collection across a large area. Here we propose and demonstrate a compact
monolithically integrated system featuring a metalens fabricated on the
backside of a surface ion trap. A 40$\times$100 $\mu$m aperture enables a
simulated point-source collection efficiency of 0.91% and a measured
point-source detection efficiency of 0.58%. Increasing the aperture area to
40$\times$600 $\mu$m boosts the simulated collection efficiency to
3.17%$-$comparable to that of a conventional objective with a numerical
aperture of 0.35. Further improvements are possible by co-optimizing the
electrode and aperture geometry. An undercut of the electrode substrate at the
aperture ensures a large distance between the ion and dielectric substrate
without compromising collection efficiency. The metalens directly collimates
the collected fluorescence, eliminating the need for a high numerical aperture
objective. An array of such readout zones will offer a compact, scalable
solution for high-fidelity parallel readout in next-generation trapped-ion
quantum processors.

Conclusion: 揭示了量子性与不可逆性之间的普遍关系，为量子技术中的资源优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Quantum technologies offer exceptional -- sometimes almost magical -- speed
and performance, yet every quantum process costs physical resources. Designing
next-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following
question: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a
desired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum
resource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the
lower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required
resource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of
resources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others --
yielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope
positions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results:
(1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the
irreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff
for any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to
free energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem,
which is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a
wide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing
resourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource
cost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in
fact require an infinite implementation cost. These findings reveal a universal
relationship between quantumness and irreversibility, providing a first step
toward a general theory that explains when -- and how -- quantumness can
suppress irreversibility.

Abstract: We establish a unified statistical framework that underscores the crucial

Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation (BIQAE), accurately and efficiently
estimates both quantum amplitudes and molecular ground-state energies to high
accuracy, and show in analytic and numerical sample complexity analyses that
BIQAE outperforms all other QAE approaches considered. Both rigorous
mathematical proofs and numerical simulations conclusively indicate Bayesian
statistics is the source of this advantage, a finding that invites further
inquiry into the power of statistics to expedite the search for quantum
utility.

Conclusion: 该研究为经典-量子加法器提供了高效的实现方案，适用于模算术电路。

Abstract: In 2004, Cuccaro et al found a quantum-quantum adder with $O(n)$ gate cost
and $O(1)$ ancilla qubits. Since then, it's been an open question whether
classical-quantum adders can achieve the same asymptotic complexity. These
costs are particularly relevant to modular arithmetic circuits, which often
offset by the classically known modulus.
  In this paper, I construct an adder that uses 3 clean ancillae and $4n \pm
O(1)$ Toffoli gates to add a classical offset into a quantum register. I also
present an adder with a Toffoli cost of $3n \pm O(1)$ that uses 2 clean
ancillae and $n-2$ dirty ancillae. I further show that applying the presented
adders conditioned on a control qubit requires no additional workspace or
Toffolis.

Conclusion: 该框架可推广至其他量子资源，为量子计算和网络设计提供理论基础。

Abstract: Inspired by environmental sciences, we develop a framework to quantify the
energy needed to generate quantum entanglement via noisy quantum channels,
focusing on the hardware-independent, i.e. fundamental cost. Within this
framework, we define a measure of the minimal fundamental energy consumption
rate per distributed entanglement (expressed in Joule per ebit). We then derive
a lower bound on the energy cost of distributing a maximally entangled state
via a quantum channel, which yields a quantitative estimate of energy
investment per entangled bit for future quantum networks. We thereby show that
irreversibility in entanglement theory implies a non-zero energy cost in
standard entanglement distribution protocols. We further establish an upper
bound on the fundamental energy consumption rate of entanglement distribution
by determining the minimal energy required to implement quantum operations via
classical control. To this end, we formulate the axioms for an energy cost
measure and introduce a Hamiltonian model for classically-controlled quantum
operations. The fundamental cost is then defined as the infimum energy over all
such Hamiltonian protocols, with or without specific hardware constraints. The
study of the energy cost of a quantum operation is general enough to be
naturally applicable to quantum computing and is of independent interest.
Finally, we evaluate the energy demands of three entanglement distillation
protocols for photonic polarization qubits, finding that, due to entanglement
irreversibility, their required energy exceeds the fundamental lower bound by
many orders of magnitude. The introduced paradigm can be applied to other
quantum resources, with appropriate changes depending on their nature.

Abstract: Parameter estimation is a critical step in continuous-variable quantum key
distribution (CV-QKD), especially in the finite-size regime where worst-case
confidence intervals can significantly reduce the achievable secret-key rate.
We provide a finite-size security analysis demonstrating that neural networks
can be reliably employed for parameter estimation in CV-QKD with quantifiable
failure probabilities $\epsilon_{PE}$, endowed with an operational
interpretation and composable security guarantees. Using a protocol that is
operationally equivalent to standard approaches, our method produces
significantly tighter confidence intervals, unlocking higher key rates even
under collective Gaussian attacks. The proposed approach yields tighter
confidence intervals, leading to a quantifiable increase in the secret-key rate
under collective Gaussian attacks. These results open up new perspectives for
integrating modern machine learning techniques into quantum cryptographic
protocols, particularly in practical resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: The advancement and scaling of quantum technology has made the learning and
identification of quantum systems and devices in highly-multidimensional
parameter spaces a pressing task for a variety of applications. In many cases,
the integration of real-time feedback control and adaptive choice of
measurement settings places strict demands on the speed of this task. Here we
present a joint model selection and parameter estimation algorithm that is fast
and operable on a large number of model parameters. The algorithm is based on
variational Bayesian inference (VBI), which approximates the target posterior
distribution by optimizing a tractable family of distributions, making it more
scalable than exact inference methods relying on sampling and that generally
suffer from high variance and computational cost in high-dimensional spaces. We
show how a regularizing prior can be used to select between competing models,
each comprising a different number of parameters, identifying the simplest
model that explains the experimental data. The regularization can further
separate the degrees of freedom, e.g. quantum systems in the environment or
processes, which contribute to major features in the observed dynamics, with
respect to others featuring small coupling, which only contribute to a
background. As an application of the introduced framework, we consider the
problem of the identification of multiple individual nuclear spins with a
single electron spin quantum sensor, relevant for nanoscale nuclear magnetic
resonance. With the number of environmental spins unknown a priori, our
Bayesian approach is able to correctly identify the model, i.e. the number of
spins and their couplings. We benchmark the algorithm on both simulated and
experimental data, using standard figures of merit, and demonstrating that we
can estimate dozens of parameters within minutes.

Abstract: Although introduced originally for entanglement, quantum repeaters and
swapping protocols have been analyzed for other quantum correlations (QC), such
as quantum discord. Introduced by Mundarain and Ladr\'on de Guevara,
local-available quantum correlations (LAQC) are a promising yet understudied
quantum correlation. Recently, Bellor\'{\i}n et al. obtained exact analytical
results for the LAQC quantifier of general 2-qubit X states. Starting from
those previous results, we analyzed the LAQC swapping for five families of
one-parameter 2-qubit X states. As expected, we find that if the initial state
and the one used for the projective measurement are correlated, the final state
will have non-zero LAQC.

argue that in Rydberg states a similar geometric angle can be generated by
mechanical rotations of an atomic-optical setup on time scales between $1~\mu$s

Abstract: Since the late 2010s, quantum computers have become commercially available,
and the number of services that users can run remotely via cloud servers is
increasing. In Japan, several domestic superconducting quantum computing
systems, including our own, began operation in 2023. However, the design of
quantum computing systems, especially in the most critical areas near quantum
computers, remains largely undisclosed, creating a significant barrier to entry
into the quantum computing field. If this situation continues, progress toward
standardization, which is essential for guiding quantum computer development,
will stall, and it will be difficult to develop a practical quantum computing
system that can perform calculations on a supercomputer scale. To address this
issue, we propose Open Quantum Toolchain for OPerators and USers (OQTOPUS), a
full-stack quantum computing system developed from research with real quantum
computers. OQTOPUS is one of the world's largest open-source software projects,
covering operational software from cloud-based execution environment
construction to system operation. Furthermore, to perform quantum computing
effectively and efficiently, it implements key features, such as transpilers,
multiprogramming, and error mitigation, in an area as close as possible to a
quantum computer, an area that system vendors rarely disclose. Finally, this
study presents experimental results of applying OQTOPUS to a real quantum
computer. OQTOPUS is publicly available on GitHub and will notably lower the
barrier to entry into the quantum computing field, contributing to the
formation of a quantum computing developer community through open discussion.

Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an
emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of
geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches,
we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with
dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to
define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between
static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how
gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct
Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining
Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector
potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations
explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity
and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological
charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space,
and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like
expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime
of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and
time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications
extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of
phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems
driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI QKD) offers unparalleled
cryptographic security by eliminating trust requirements for quantum devices,
yet has remained impractical for long-distance implementation due to
fundamental rate limitations. Here, we propose the first experimentally viable
schemes for long-distance DI QKD using two fully photonic approaches with
heralded entanglement distribution using spontaneous parametric down-conversion
(SPDC) sources. Both schemes achieve key rate scaling with the square root of
channel transmissivity $\eta_t$, matching the twin-field protocol advantage
rather than the prohibitive linear decay of conventional QKD. We demonstrate
positive key rates at detector efficiencies as low as 83\%, bringing DI QKD
within reach of the current superconducting detector technology. Our security
analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem to establish rigorous
finite-size bounds, while numerical optimization yields custom Bell
certificates that surpass standard approaches by 2--3 times at maximum
transmission distances. This work represents a critical milestone toward
device-independent security in quantum communication networks, providing
experimentalists with practical implementation pathways while maintaining the
strongest possible security guarantees against quantum adversaries.

Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) has attracted significant attention as a promising
quantum material due to its ability to host long-lived, optically addressable
color centers with solid-state photonic interfaces. The CMOS compatibility of
4H-SiCOI (silicon-carbide-on-insulator) makes it an ideal platform for
integrated quantum photonic devices and circuits. However, the deterministic
integration of single spin defects into high-performance photonic cavities on
this platform has remained a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the
deterministic and scalable coupling of both ensemble (PL4) and single PL6 spin
defects into monolithic bullseye cavities on the 4H-SiCOI platform. By tuning
the cavity resonance, we achieve a 40-fold enhancement of the zero-phonon line
(ZPL) intensity from ensemble PL4 defects, corresponding to a Purcell factor of
approximately 5.0. For deterministically coupled single PL6 defects, we observe
a threefold increase in the saturated photon count rate, confirm single-photon
emission, and demonstrate coherent control of the spin state through optically
detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), resonant excitation, and Rabi oscillations.
These advancements establish a viable pathway for developing scalable,
high-performance SiC-based quantum photonic circuits.

Conclusion: 提出的保护策略显著优于无保护方案，验证了其在增强BQT鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents strategies for enhancing the robustness of bidirectional
quantum teleportation (BQT) through environment-assisted and weak measurement
techniques. BQT is a crucial component of distributed quantum networks,
allowing for the bilateral transfer of quantum information between two nodes.
While perfect teleportation necessitates maximally entangled states, these are
vulnerable to degradation due to inherent decoherence. We propose a BQT scheme
that enables the bilateral transfer of arbitrary qubits between nodes via
amplitude damping channels (ADC), aiming to optimize fidelity using weak
measurements in the final step of the process. Environment-assisted
measurements (EAM) are used to establish a four-qubit channel composed of two
Bell states. We explore two situations: (I) where only the recovery qubits pass
through amplitude damping channels and (II) where the entire four-qubit channel
is subjected to ADC. Our findings demonstrate a balance between average
fidelity and success probability when the weak measurement strength ($q_w$) is
constrained by the decay rate ($p$), specifically $q_w \in {[0,p]}$. Perfect
BQT is achieved when $q_w = p$, indicating complete suppression of ADC effects.
On the other hand, a decline in both average fidelity and success probability
is noted when the weak measurement strength surpasses the ADC strength, marking
the prohibited domain as $q_w \in {(p,1]}$. Additionally, our secured BQT
protocol consistently outperforms the unprotected scheme in both scenarios,
highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed protection strategies.

Conclusion: 该电路为金融量子计算提供了可行方案，并展示了量子优势的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum entanglement enables exponential computational states, while
superposition provides inherent parallelism. Consequently, quantum circuits are
theoretically capable of supporting large scale parallel computation. However,
applying them to financial analysis particularly in the areas of random number
generation and payoff computation remains a significant challenge. Experts
generally believe that quantum computing relies on matrix operations, which are
deterministic in nature without randomness. This inherent determinism makes it
particularly challenging to design quantum circuits that require random number
injection. JP Morgan[1] introduced the piecewise linear (PWL) approach for
modeling payoff computations but did not disclose a quantum circuit capable of
identifying values exceeding the strike price, suggesting a possible reliance
on classical pre processing for interval classification. This paper presents an
integrated quantum circuit with two key components: one for random number
injection, applicable to risk assessment, and the other for direct payoff
computation, relevant to financial pricing. These components are compatible
with a scalable framework that leverages large scale parallelism and Quantum
Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to achieve quadratic speedup. The circuit was
implemented on IBM Qiskit and evaluated using 8 parallel threads and 1600
measurement shots. Results confirmed both the presence of randomness and the
correctness of payoff computation. While the current implementation uses 8
threads, the design scales to 2 to the power of n threads, for arbitrarily
large n, offering a potential path toward demonstrating quantum supremacy.

Motivation: 传统零噪声外推法（ZNE）在深度电路和高噪声环境下效果不佳，需要一种更高效且可靠的方法来缓解量子计算中的误差。

Method: 提出一种基于核心操作块误差表征的轻量级外推框架，通过浅层电路估计块保真度，并重构缓解后的成功概率。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了ZNE在高噪声下的局限性，显著提升了量子算法的可靠性，尤其在结构化算法中表现优异。

Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is a crucial technique for suppressing errors
especially in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, enabling more reliable
quantum computation without the overhead of full error correction. Zero-Noise
Extrapolation (ZNE), which we mainly consider in this work, is one of prominent
quantum error mitigation methods. For algorithms with deep circuits - such as
iterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's
effectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise. Extrapolation based
on such low-fidelity data often yields inaccurate estimates and requires
substantial overhead. In this study, we propose a lightweight,
extrapolation-based error mitigation framework tailored for structured quantum
algorithms composed of repeating operational blocks. The proposed method
characterizes the error of the repeated core operational block, rather than the
full algorithm, using shallow circuits. Extrapolation is used to estimate the
block fidelity, followed by a reconstruction of the mitigated success
probability. We validate our method via simulations of the 6-qubit Grover's
algorithm on IBM's Aer simulator, then further evaluating it on the real
127-qubit IBM Quantum system based on Eagle r3 under a physical noise
environment. Our results, particularly those from Aer simulator, demonstrate
that the core block's error follows a highly consistent exponential decay. This
allows our technique to achieve robust error mitigation, overcoming the
limitations of conventional ZNE which is often compromised by statistically
unreliable data from near-random behavior under heavy noise. In low-noise
conditions, our method approaches theoretical success probability, outperforms
ZNE. In high-noise conditions, ZNE fails to mitigate errors due to overfitting
of its extrapolation data, whereas our method achieves over a 20% higher
success probability.

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate a fully passive discrete-state continuous-variable
quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), which can eliminate all modulator side
channels on the source side, using a local local oscillator (LLO). The CV-QKD
system achieves a maximum transmission length of 100 km with a repetition rate
of 1 GHz using specially designed phase rotation and discretization methods,
and the corresponding secret key bit rate is 127 kbps, as estimated based on
the amplitude of prepared states at the transmitter, as well as the first- and
second-order moments of quadratures at the receiver by employing the convex
optimization without imposing any assumptions on the quantum channel. The
performance of the protocol is similar to that of modulated CV LLO protocols
and better than those of passive discrete-variable and CV protocols. Our
protocol is expected to play an important role in the quantum metropolitan area
networks and quantum access networks with high realistic security.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced machine learning, encompassing both quantum algorithms and
quantum-inspired classical methods such as tensor networks, offers promising
tools for extracting structure from complex, high-dimensional data. In this
work, we study the training dynamics of Matrix Product State (MPS) classifiers
applied to three-class problems, using both fashion MNIST and hyper-spectral
satellite imagery as representative datasets. We investigate the phenomenon of
grokking, where generalization emerges suddenly after memorization, by tracking
entanglement entropy, local magnetization, and model performance across
training sweeps. Additionally, we employ information theory tools to gain
deeper insights: transfer entropy is used to reveal causal dependencies between
label-specific quantum masks, while O-information captures the shift from
synergistic to redundant correlations among class outputs. Our results show
that grokking in the fashion MNIST task coincides with a sharp entanglement
transition and a peak in redundant information, whereas the overfitted
hyper-spectral model retains synergistic, disordered behavior. These findings
highlight the relevance of high-order information dynamics in quantum-inspired
learning and emphasize the distinct learning behaviors that emerge in
multi-class classification, offering a principled framework to interpret
generalization in quantum machine learning architectures.

Abstract: In pursuit of a global quantum key distribution (QKD) network, a service
based on untrusted nodes on geostationary satellites could offer wide coverage,
continuous operation, and enhanced security compared to the trusted node
alternative. Although this scenario has been studied for entanglement-based
protocols, such an approach would require large-area telescopes both on the
ground and in space. In this work, we analyze the performance of two QKD
protocols well adapted to this scenario, namely twin-field (TF) and
mode-pairing (MP) QKD, which exhibit high resilience to high-loss channels.
Leveraging an in-depth simulation of communication channels corrected with
adaptive optics, we assess the expected secret key rates for both protocols in
a configuration involving two 50 cm telescopes on board the satellite and
ground-based telescopes ranging from 20 cm to 1 m in aperture. Our results show
that, in the best case and considering realistic detectors, it is possible to
achieve secret key rates on the order of a few hundred bit/s for both TF and
MP-QKD. We show, notably, that secret key generation is potentially feasible
even with 20 cm ground telescopes, highlighting the high scalability potential
of such a configuration.

Conclusion: 玻色子量子系统的非高斯特征编码于波函数零点中。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger wavefunction is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics, quantum
chemistry, and bosonic quantum information theory. Its zero-set for fermionic
systems is well-studied and central for determining chemical properties, yet
for bosonic systems the zero-set is less understood, especially in the context
of characterizing non-classicality. Here we study the zeros of such
wavefunctions and give them a novel information-theoretic interpretation. Our
main technical result is showing that the wavefunction of most bosonic quantum
systems can be extended to a holomorphic function over the complex plane,
allowing the application of powerful techniques from complex analysis. As a
consequence, we prove a version of Hudson's theorem for the wavefunction and
characterize Gaussian dynamics as classical motion of the wavefunction zeros.
Our findings suggest that the non-Gaussianity of quantum optical states can be
detected by measuring a single quadrature of the electromagnetic field, which
we demonstrate in a companion paper [1]. More generally, our results show that
the non-Gaussian features of bosonic quantum systems are encoded in the zeros
of their wavefunction.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive classification of one-dimensional coined quantum
walks on the infinite line, focusing on the spatial probability distributions
they induce. Building on prior results, we identify all initial coin states
that lead to symmetric quantum walks for arbitrary coins, and provide a
bijective parametrisation of all symmetric quantum walks modulo distributional
equivalence. Extending beyond the symmetric case, we also give a surjective
parametrisation of all coined quantum walks under the same equivalence relation
and a bijective parametrisation modulo equivalence of the walks' limiting
distributions.
  Furthermore, we derive corrected closed-form expressions for the walk
amplitudes, resolving inaccuracies in previous literature, and generalise the
approach to the correlated classical random walk. This unified framework
enables a direct comparison between quantum and classical dynamics.
Additionally, we discuss the asymptotic scaling of variances for both models,
identifying quadratic spreading as a hallmark of non-trivial quantum walks and
contrasting it with the linear behaviour of classical walks, except at the
extremal points of maximal correlation. Finally, we compare the limiting
distributions arising from quantum walks with the ones in the classical case.

Abstract: Quantum metrology enables sensitive dark matter detection, particularly using
nonclassical states, such as Schr\"odinger cat states featuring sub-Planck
interference structures in microwave cavities. Here, we report the first
experimental application of four-component Schr\"odinger cat states within a
high-quality superconducting microwave cavity to detect dark photons, a
potential dark matter candidate. We demonstrate an 8.1-fold enhancement in the
signal photon rate and constrain the dark photon kinetic mixing angle to an
unprecedented $\epsilon < 7.32 \times 10^{-16}$ near 6.44~GHz (26.6~$\mu$eV).
By employing a parametric sideband drive to actively tune the cavity frequency,
we achieve dark photon searches and background subtraction across multiple
frequency bins, yielding a sensitivity at the $10^{-16}$ level within a 100~kHz
bandwidth. Our Schr\"odinger's cat-assisted detection (SCaD) scheme
demonstrates a substantial improvement over previous results, promising
potential implications in quantum-enhanced searches for new physics.

Abstract: Topological manipulation of light provides a versatile toolbox for photonic
technologies. Here, we show that a topological atom array can induce photon
localization in a waveguide via symmetry-protected light-matter interaction.
Long-lived photon-atom entanglement reveals the existence of a novel
topological quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC). This hybrid
light-matter quasi-BIC is formed at a critical coupling condition via
collectively induced absorption, which is produced by quantum interference
between edge and bulk states. We uncover the time-reversed relation between
topological quasi-BIC and light amplification. Interestingly, one can realize a
directional ultranarrow amplifier by means of critical coupling. Our work
demonstrates an unconventional quasi-BIC at a topological quantum optics
interface with potential applications in quantum devices.

Abstract: We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum
mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally
compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg
quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that
in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can
still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized
(non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution.
They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures
on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups.
We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with
the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a
compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian
groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.

Abstract: State-dependent conformational changes play a central role in molecular
dynamics, yet they are often difficult to observe or simulate due to their
complexity and ultrafast nature. One alternative approach is to emulate such
phenomena using quantum simulations with cold, trapped ions. In their
electronic ground state, these ions form long-lived Wigner crystals. When
excited to high-lying electronic Rydberg states, the ions experience a modified
trapping potential, resulting in a strong coupling between their electronic and
vibrational degrees of freedom. In an ion crystal, this vibronic coupling
creates electronic state-dependent potential energy surfaces that can support
distinct crystal structures -- closely resembling the conformational changes of
molecules driven by electronic excitations. Here, we present the first
experimental observation of this effect, by laser-coupling a single ion at the
centre of a three-ion crystal to a Rydberg state. By tuning the system close to
a structural phase transition, the excitation induces a state-dependent
conformational change, transforming the Wigner crystal from a linear to a
zigzag configuration. This structural change leads to a strong hybridisation
between vibrational and electronic states, producing a clear spectroscopic
signature in the Rydberg excitation. Our findings mark the first experimental
step towards using Rydberg ions to create and study artificial molecular
systems. change leads to a strong hybridisation between vibrational and

Conclusion: 这一效应不仅限于电磁学，可能适用于所有辐射类型，需重新思考辐射理论。

Abstract: The existence of electromagnetic radiation - radio-waves, microwaves, light,
x-rays and so on - is one of the most important physical phenomena, and our
ability to manipulate them is one of the most significant technological
achievement of humankind. Underlying this ability is our understanding of how
radiation is produced: whenever an electric charge is accelerated, it radiates.
Or, at least, this is how it has been hitherto universally thought. Here we
prove that quantum mechanically electric charges can be accelerated without
radiating. The physical setup leading to this behavior is relatively simple
(once one knows what to do) but its reasons are deep: it relies on the fact
that quantum mechanically particles can be accelerated even when no forces act
on them, via the Aharonov-Bohm effect. As we argue, the effect presented here
is just them tip of an iceberg - it implies the need to reconsider the basic
understanding of radiation. Finally, it seems clear that the effect goes far
beyond electromagnetism and applies to any kind of radiation.

Abstract: Efficient parametrizations of quantum states are essential for trainable
hybrid classical-quantum algorithms. A key challenge in their design consists
in adapting to the available qubit connectivity of the quantum processor, which
limits the capacity to generate correlations between distant qubits in a
resource-efficient and trainable manner. In this work we first introduce an
algorithm that optimizes qubit routing for arbitrary connectivity graphs,
resulting in a swap network that enables direct interactions between any pair
of qubits. We then propose a co-design of circuit layers and qubit routing by
embedding the derived swap networks within layered, connectivity-aware
ans\"atze. This construction significantly improves the trainability of the
ansatz, leading to enhanced performance with reduced resources. We showcase
these improvements through ground-state simulations of strongly correlated
systems, including spin-glass and molecular electronic structure models. Across
exemplified connectivities, the swap-enhanced ansatz consistently achieves
lower energy errors using fewer entangling gates, shallower circuits, and fewer
parameters than standard layered-structured baselines. Our results indicate
that swap network augmented ans\"atze provide enhanced trainability and
resource-efficient design to capture complex correlations on devices with
constrained qubit connectivity.

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) has potential for a scientific revolution
through numerous practical applications like finding better medicines,
batteries, materials, catalysts etc. Many QPE algorithms use the Hadamard test
to estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$ for a large integer $k$ for an
efficiently preparable initial state $|\psi\rangle$ and an efficiently
implementable unitary operator $U$. The Hadamard test is hard to implement
because it requires controlled applications of $U^{k}$. Recently, a Sequential
Hadamard test (SHT) was proposed (arXiv:2506.18765) which requires controlled
application of $U$ only but its total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ scales as
$\mathcal{O}(k^{3}/\epsilon^{2}r_{\rm min}^{2})$ where $r_{\rm min}$ is the
minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{k'}|\psi\rangle|$ among all integers $k'
\leq k$. Typically $r_{\rm min}$ is exponentially low and SHT becomes too slow.
We present a new algorithm, the SANDWICH test to address this bottleneck. Our
algorithm uses efficient preparation of the initial state $|\psi\rangle$ to
efficiently implement the SPROTIS operator $R_{\psi}^{\phi}$ where SPROTIS
stands for the Selective Phase Rotation of the Initial State. It sandwiches the
SPROTIS operator between $U^{a}$ and $U^{b}$ for integers $\{a,b\} \leq k$ to
estimate $\langle \psi|U^{k}|\psi\rangle$. The total run time $T_{\rm tot}$ is
$\mathcal{O}(k^{2}\ln k/ \epsilon^{2} s_{\rm min}^{6})$. Here $s_{\rm min}$ is
the minimum value of $|\langle \psi|U^{\hat{k}}|\psi\rangle$ among all integers
$\hat{k}$ which are values of the nodes of a random binary sum tree whose root
node value is $k$ and leaf nodes' values are $1$ or $0$. It can be reasonably
expected that $s_{\rm min} \not\ll 1$ in typical cases because there is wide
freedom in choosing the random binary sum tree.

Motivation: 探讨量子加速在无法反转过程时的局限性，解释为何在量子学习、计量和传感中难以实现。

Result: 无逆操作时，量子加速难以实现；有逆操作时，量子加速普遍存在。

Conclusion: 量子加速的普遍性依赖于对过程的高效反转能力。

Abstract: We prove that the generic quantum speedups for brute-force search and
counting only hold when the process we apply them to can be efficiently
inverted. The algorithms speeding up these problems, amplitude amplification
and amplitude estimation, assume the ability to apply a state preparation
unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$; we give problem instances based on
trace estimation where no algorithm which uses only $U$ beats the naive,
quadratically slower approach. Our proof of this is simple and goes through the
compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry. Since these two subroutines are
responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic "Grover" speedup in quantum
algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in
the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings,
$U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$
can be much harder -- tantamount to reversing time within the system. Our
result suggests a dichotomy: without inverse access, quantum speedups are
scarce; with it, quantum speedups abound.

Abstract: The interplay of disorder and dimensionality governs the emergence and
stability of electronic phases in quantum materials and quantum phase
transitions among them. While three-dimensional (3D) dirty Fermi liquids and
Weyl semimetals support robust metallic states, undergoing disorder-driven
Anderson localization transitions at strong disorder and the later ones
exhibiting additional semimetal-to-metal transition at moderate disorder,
conventional two-dimensional (2D) non-interacting systems localize for
arbitrarily weak disorder. Here, we show that 2D disordered projected branes,
constructed by systematically integrating out degrees of freedom from a 3D
cubic lattice via the Schur decomposition, faithfully reproduce the full
quantum phase diagram of their 3D parent systems. Using large-scale exact
diagonalization and kernel polynomial method, we numerically demonstrate that
2D projected branes host stable metallic and semimetallic phases. Remarkably,
the critical exponents governing the semimetal-to-metal and metal-insulator
transitions on such 2D projected branes are sufficiently close to those of
their 3D counterparts. Our findings thus establish 2D projected branes as
genuine quantum holographic images of their higher-dimensional disordered
parent crystals, supporting stable semimetallic and metallic phases that are
otherwise inaccessible in conventional 2D lattices. Finally, we point to
experimentally accessible metamaterial platforms, most notably the photonic
lattices with tunable refractive-index disorder, as promising systems to
realize and probe these phenomena.

Abstract: It is experimentally well-established that non-equilibrium long-range
correlations of concentration fluctuations appear in free diffusion of a solute
in a solvent, but it remains unknown how such correlations are established
dynamically. We address this problem in a model of Donev, Fai \& Vanden-Eijnden
(DFV), obtained from the high-Schmidt limit of the Landau-Lifschitz fluctuating
hydrodynamic equations for a binary mixture. We consider an initial planar
interface of the mean concentration field in an infinite space domain,
idealizing prior experiments. Using methods borrowed from turbulence theory, we
show both analytically and numerically that a quasi-steady regime with
self-similar time decay of concentration correlations appears at long time. In
addition to the expected ``giant concentration fluctuations'' with correlations
$\propto r$ for $r\lesssim L(t)=(Dt)^{1/2},$ with diffusivity $D,$ a new regime
with spatial decay $\propto 1/r$ appears for $r\gtrsim L(t).$ The quasi-steady
regime arises from an initial stage of transient growth $\propto t,$ confirming
the prediction of DFV for $r\gtrsim L(t)$ and discovering an analogous result
for $r\lesssim L(t).$ Our results give new insight into the emergence of
non-equilibrium long-range correlations and provide novel predictions that may
be investigated experimentally.

Abstract: Ising machines (IMs) are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve
combinatorial optimization problems. Among such problems, Boolean
Satisfiability (SAT) is particularly relevant in industrial applications. To
solve SAT problems using IMs, it is crucial to incorporate higher-order
interactions. However, in analog IMs, interactions of different orders scale
unevenly with the continuous spin amplitudes, introducing imbalances that can
significantly degrade performance. We present a numerical comparison of methods
to mitigate these imbalances, evaluating time-to-solution and success rate on
Uniform Random 3-SAT instances from the SATLIB benchmark set. Our results show
that the most effective approach employs spin interactions that are
proportional to the signs of spins, rather than their continuous amplitudes.
This generalizes our previous work, which showed that such interactions best
mitigate imbalances induced by external fields in quadratic analog IMs. In this
work, its advantage becomes substantially more pronounced, as it naturally
mitigates imbalances across all interaction orders. We further demonstrate that
smooth approximations of this method make it compatible with analog hardware.
Our findings underscore the central role of spin-sign-based interactions in
enabling robust and scalable analog IM dynamics.

Abstract: The study of interacting topological bands with a tunable bandwidth offers a
unique platform to study the interplay of intertwined orders and emergent
non-electronic excitations. Here we design a time-reversal symmetric and
sign-problem-free electronic model with tunable Chern bands carrying
valley-contrasting Chern number, interacting via competing (anti-)ferromagnetic
interactions. Using numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo computations, we
analyze the many-body phase-diagram as a function of temperature and band
filling fractions over a wide range of electronic bandwidth, interaction
anisotropy, and an Ising spin-orbit coupling. At a commensurate filling of the
Chern bands, the ground state hosts intra-valley ferromagnetic coherence and
inter-valley antiferomagnetism, thus realizing an insulating Chern
antiferromagnet (CAF). Upon doping, the ground-state develops
superconductivity, but where the low-energy charged quasiparticles are
composite objects -- electrons dressed by multiple spin-flip excitations. These
spin-polaron (or skyrmion) excitations persist in the presence of a weak
spin-orbit coupling. In a companion article, we address the emergent symmetries
and low-energy field-theoretic aspects of the problem and reveal the proximity
to a deconfined quantum critical point. We end by providing a general outlook
towards building microscopic connections with models of interacting moir\'e
materials, including twisted bilayer graphene, where many of the ingredients
considered here are naturally present.

Abstract: The Landau paradigm has been a powerful framework for understanding phase
transitions involving spontaneous symmetry breaking. In contrast, phase
transitions between two symmetric phases, where neither phase breaks any
symmetry, remain less explored. One intriguing class of such transitions
involves "symmetric mass generation" (SMG), where interactions drive a
transition from a gapless symmetric phase to a gapped symmetric phase. In this
work, we develop a controlled perturbative approach to study a class of such
transitions, based on an $\epsilon$-expansion around the critical dimension
where the SMG-inducing-interaction becomes marginal. Applying this method to
two distinct models, we identify a single-parameter-tuned transition in each
case, which we conjecture captures the universal critical behavior of the SMG
transition in these models. We compute universal quantities associated with
these transitions.

Abstract: The electron in a solid can be considered a bound state of the three
independent, fundamental degrees of freedom creating quasi-particles: spinons,
carrying the electron spin; plasmons carrying the collective charge mode and
orbitons carrying its orbital degree of freedom. These fundamental degrees of
freedom could form ordering states in which dynamics or collective motions
could occurr and manifest as low-energy excitations. The exotic properties that
appear in the materials exhibiting these electronic orderings are associated
with these low-energy excitations. Although the orbital order (OO) and its
coupling to the spin system creates very interesting phenomena, the microscopic
origin of OO has been much less explored than other electronic properties as it
is very difficult to directly access experimental information from OO. Due to
the recent improvement in energy resolution and flux, soft x-ray resonant
inelastic scattering (RIXS) allows for a re-examination of orbital excitations
in manganites. Here, we present a study of low energy excitations in half doped
A-site ordered SmBaMn_{2}O_{6} through a combination of RIXS and soft x-ray
resonant elastic scattering (REXS) measurements. The obtained experimental data
confirm the OO at \mathbf{q} = (0.25, 0.25, 0) and find various low energy
excitations below 200 meV. while several excitations can be assigned to be of
magnetic and phononic origin, a group of excitations between 80 and 200 meV
show a temperature dependence distinctively following that of the OO making
them possible candidates for orbital excitations.

Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an
efficient and low-cost algorithm for addressing the sign problem. It mitigates
the sign problem while avoiding the ergodicity issues that are intrinsic to
algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In this study, we apply the WV-HMC
method to the Hubbard model away from half filling, which is known to suffer
from a severe sign problem. We compute the number density on lattices of
spatial size $6 \times 6$ and $8 \times 8$ at inverse temperature $\beta = 6.4$
using $N_t = 20$ Trotter steps. Our results show that the WV-HMC method remains
effective even in parameter regions where non-thimble Monte Carlo methods fail
due to severe sign problems. In this work, we employ direct solvers for fermion
matrix inversion, with a computational cost of $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the
number of degrees of freedom and proportional to the spacetime lattice volume.
An alternative algorithm employing pseudofermions and iterative solvers, which
reduces the cost to $O(N^2)$ at the expense of careful parameter tuning, will
be discussed in a separate publication.

Abstract: Electronic nematic order is a correlated phase of matter in which low-energy
electronic states spontaneously break a discrete rotational symmetry of a
crystal lattice. Bilinear coupling between the electronic nematic and strains
of the same symmetry yields a single pseudoproper ferroelastic phase transition
at which both the nematic and lattice strain onset concurrently. To minimize
elastic energy, the crystal forms structural twin domains, each with a distinct
orientation of the nematic director (i.e. each with a specific sign of the
induced shear strain). While the effects of externally induced strains on these
domains are well established, the intrinsic behavior of spontaneous strain
fields within individual domains has been hitherto unexplored, largely due to
the lack of appropriate experimental tools. Here, we report the discovery of
spontaneous mesoscopic strain waves within individual nematic domains of an
underdoped iron-based superconductor, observed using dark-field X-ray
microscopy (DFXM). This technique combines high spatial and reciprocal-space
resolution with full-field, bulk-sensitive imaging, enabling direct
visualization of subdomain strain modulations emerging concurrently with the
onset of nematic order. The elastic compatibility relations that govern
inhomogeneous strains in continuous solids provide a natural mechanism for the
emergent strain waves that we observe. Our findings reveal a broadly relevant
form of strain self-organization and position DFXM as a powerful tool for
probing the local interplay between lattice strain and electronic order.

Abstract: Electronic nematicity is widely observed in quantum materials with varying
degrees of electronic correlation, manifesting through charge, spin, orbital,
or superconducting degrees of freedom. A phenomenological model capable of
describing this broad set of systems must also account for nemato-elasticity,
by which nematic and elastic degrees of freedom become intertwined. However,
being a tensor gauge field theory, elasticity must satisfy the compatibility
relations which guarantee the integrability of lattice deformations. Here, we
develop a formalism for nemato-elasticity that manifestly respects the elastic
compatibility relations. We show that these constraints bifurcate the phase
space of nematic fluctuations into two orthogonal sectors: one compatible and
thus critical, the other incompatible and therefore gapped. The suppression of
the latter leads to universal direction-selective nematic criticality in any
crystal lattice. Moreover, the critical nematic modes are protected from
pinning effects induced by microscopic defect strains, which necessarily induce
both longitudinal and transverse correlated random fields. Finally, our results
also reconcile seemingly contradictory nematic phenomena, such as the
mean-field character of the nematic transition and the widespread presence of
domain formation.

Abstract: The defining property of electronic nematicity -- the spontaneous breaking of
rotational symmetry -- implies an unavoidable coupling between the nematic
order parameter and elastic strain fields, known as nemato-elasticity. While
both quantities are rank-2 tensors, the strain tensor is constrained through
the Saint Venant compatibility relations. These three coupled second-order
partial differential equations arise from the lattice displacement vector's
role as a potential field, and they reflect the underlying gauge invariance of
geometric deformations which are violated only in the presence of crystalline
defects. In this work, we develop a theory of nemato-elasticity that
incorporates elastic compatibility explicitly through a co-rotating helical
basis. With our formalism, we show elasticity bestows tensor compatibility upon
the nematic order parameter by suppressing incompatible nematic fluctuations.
As a result, nemato-elasticity is markedly different from bare nematicity. In
ideal media devoid of defects, we show the suppression of incompatible
nematicity underlies direction-selective criticality, even in the absence of
crystalline anisotropy. In systems with defects, meanwhile, we show that
elastic pinning fields emanate from quenched defects, generating random
longitudinal and transverse conjugate fields for the local nematic order
parameter. The coexistence of direction-selective nematic criticality with
pinning effects from random fields is explained within our theory from the
transformation to the helical basis, implying that local experimental probes of
nematicity will be influenced by a linear -- but nonlocal -- combination of
long-ranged and short-ranged helical nematic modes. Because the compatibility
relations are gauge constraints endowed in the isotropic medium, our results
constitute universal features of nemato-elastic criticality present in all
crystalline systems.

Abstract: In translationally invariant semiconductors that host exciton bound states,
one can define an infinite number of possible exciton Berry connections. These
correspond to the different ways in which a many-body exciton state, at fixed
total momentum, can be decomposed into free electron and hole Bloch states that
are entangled by an exciton envelope wave function. Inspired by the modern
theory of polarization, we define an exciton projected position operator whose
eigenvalues single out two unique choices of exciton Berry phase and associated
Berry connection - one for electrons, and one for holes. We clarify the
physical meaning of these exciton Berry phases and provide a discrete Wilson
loop formulation that allows for their numerical calculation without a smooth
gauge. As a corollary, we obtain a gauge-invariant expression for the exciton
polarisation at a given total momentum, i.e. the mean separation of the
electron and hole within the exciton wave function. In the presence of
crystalline inversion symmetry, the electron and hole exciton Berry phases are
quantized to the same value and we derive how this value can be expressed in
terms of inversion eigenvalues of the many-body exciton state. We then consider
crystalline $C_2 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry, for which no symmetry eigenvalues are
available as it is anti-unitary, and confirm that the exciton Berry phase
remains quantized and still diagnoses topologically distinct exciton bands. Our
theory thereby generalizes the notion of shift excitons, whose exciton Wannier
states are displaced from those of the non-interacting bands by a quantized
amount, beyond symmetry indicators.

Abstract: We theoretically explore higher-order topological magnons in collinear
altermagnets, encompassing a dimensional hierarchy ranging from localized
corner modes to propagating hinge excitations. By employing antiferromagnetic
interlayer coupling in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian, our work
reveals anisotropic surface states and spatially distributed hinge modes within
AA-type stacking configurations. We track the adiabatic evolution of Wannier
centers to identify the bulk-polarization with second-order topological magnon
insulator (SOTMI), where various magnon spectra demonstrate symmetry-protected
band structure beyond conventional topology. Harnessing the stability and
propagative properties of hinge modes, our study offers a potential platform
for magnonic quantum information processing in altermagnetic systems that

Abstract: Antimony (Sb), an element with strong spin-orbit coupling, is predicted to
undergo a topological phase transition from a topological semimetal to a
topological insulator as its dimensionality approaches the two-dimensional
limit, driven by the quantum confinement effect. In this study, we investigate
this transition in Sb thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, employing
electrical transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). Electrical transport measurements revealed signatures of a modified
electronic band structure, including a Hall response with multiple carrier
types, a decreasing carrier concentration, and a transition in the curvature of
the longitudinal resistance from quadratic to linear with decreasing film
thickness. Temperature-dependent magnetoresistance further showed weak
antilocalization below 16 K, indicating strong spin-orbit coupling and
suggesting the presence of non-trivial topological states. Analysis of the WAL
characteristics revealed a single coherent conducting channel and a
thickness-dependent change in the phase decoherence mechanism. Complementary
ARPES measurements confirmed that reducing the film thickness lifts the
conduction band at the M-point, consistent with the emergence of a band gap.
These findings support theoretical predictions of a thickness-dependent band
structure evolution driven by the quantum confinement effect, providing a
foundation for further exploration of topological phase transitions in Sb as
well as Bi1-xSbx. The realization of an elemental topological material with
simplified stoichiometry and semiconductor compatibility presents a promising
avenue for next-generation hybrid systems and applications in spintronics and
quantum technologies.

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor and quantum Fisher information have recently
been shown to provide a unified geometric description of the linear response of
many-body systems. However, a similar geometric description of higher-order
perturbative phenomena including nonlinear response in generic quantum systems
is lacking. In this work, we develop a general framework for the time-dependent
quantum geometry of many-body systems by treating external perturbing fields as
coordinates on the space of density matrices. We use the Bures distance between
the initial and time-evolved density matrix to define geometric quantities
through a perturbative expansion. To lowest order, we derive a time-dependent
generalization of the Bures metric related to the spectral density of linear
response functions, unifying previous results for the quantum metric in various
limits and providing a geometric interpretation of Fermi's golden rule. At next
order in the expansion, we define a time-dependent Bures-Levi-Civita connection
for general many-body systems. We show that the connection is the sum of one
contribution that is related to a second-order nonlinear response function, and
a second contribution that captures the higher geometric structure of
first-order perturbation theory. We show that in the quasistatic,
zero-temperature limit for noninteracting fermions, this Bures connection
reduces to the known expression for band-theoretic Christoffel symbols. Our
work provides a systematic framework to explore many-body quantum geometry
beyond the quantum metric and highlights how higher-order correlation functions
can probe this geometry.

Abstract: We present models of topological insulating Hamiltonians exhibiting intrinsic
altermagnetic features, protected by combined three-fold or four-fold
rotational symmetries with time-reversal. We demonstrate that the spin Chern
number serves as a robust topological invariant in two-dimensional systems,
while for three-dimensional structures, the topological nature is characterized
by the spin Chern numbers computed on the $k_z$=$0$ and $k_z$=$\pi$ planes. The
resulting phases support symmetry-protected boundary modes, including corner,
hinges and surface states, whose structure is determined by the magnetic
symmetry and the local magnetic moments. Our findings bridge the fields of
altermagnetism and topological quantum matter, and establish a theoretical
framework for engineering spintronic topological systems without net
magnetization.

Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a
higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an
irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is
constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice
that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when
such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an
aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension.
In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological
crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$)
symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological
branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust
endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap
modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being
devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that
such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and
weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states
residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects,
besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we
showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order
topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in
its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline
branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes
only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal.
Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally
harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.

Abstract: Single atomic adsorbates on ultrathin insulating films provide a promising
route toward bottom-up quantum architectures based on atomically identical yet
individually addressable spin qubits on solid surfaces. A key challenge in
engineering quantum-coherent spin nanostructures lies in understanding and
controlling the spin state of individual adsorbates. In this work, we
investigate single titanium (Ti) atoms adsorbed on MgO/Ag(100) surfaces using a
combined scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. Our
measurements reveal two distinct spin states, $S = 1/2$ and $S = 1$, depending
on the local adsorption site and the thickness of the MgO film. Density
functional theory calculations suggest a Ti$^+$ configuration for the Ti
adsorbates with approximately 3 electrons in the 4$s$ and 3$d$ valence shells.
Using a multi-orbital atomic multiplet calculations the site dependence of the
spin can be rationalized as a charge redistribution between spin-polarizing and
depolarizing orbitals. These findings underscore the potential of
surface-supported single atoms as spin qubits with tunable spin and charge
states, enabling atom-by-atom control in the realization of a versatile quantum
platform on surfaces.

Abstract: The detection and manipulation of the spin configurations in layered magnetic
semiconductors hold significant interest for developing spintronic devices in
two-dimensional limit. In this letter, we report a systematical study on the
photoluminescence (PL) from the high energy excitons in few-layer CrSBr and its
application on detecting the spin configurations. Besides the broad excitonic
emission peak (Xl) at around 1.34 eV, we also observed another strong excitonic
emission peak (Xh) at around 1.37 eV in hBN encapsulated 2L sample, which
splits into two peaks in 3L and 4L samples. With help of the first principles
calculations, we conclude that the Xh peak is associated with the transition
between the top valence band and the second lowest conduction band, which is
forbidden by the inversion symmetry in 1L CrSBr. Furthermore, the position and
intensity of the Xh peak are strongly dependent on the interlayer magnetic
order of the CrSBr samples, which provides an efficient way to probe their spin
configurations. In addition, when the magnetic field is applied at the easy
axis direction, we resolve an intermediate magnetic state besides the
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states in 3L and 4L samples. Our results
reveal few-layer CrSBr as an ideal platform to study the interaction between
the excitons and magnetism.

Abstract: We investigate from first principles a variety of low-dimensional open
quantum spin systems based on magnetic nanographene structures that contain
spin-1/2 and spin-1 triangulenes and/or olympicenes. These graphene
nanostructures behave as localized spins and can be effectively described by a
quantum bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we will compute
the energy spectrum and the quantum numbers associated with the low-energy
eigenstates. We propose the experimental realization of antiferromagnetic
alternating spin chains using these graphene nanostructures, which result in
ferrimagnetic systems whose ground state spin and degeneracy depend on the
length of the chain. We also identify a double degeneracy in the total spin
quantum number $S$ in the first excited state for three-leg spin graphs
(3-LSGs). This degeneracy depends on both the number of sites and the spin
species that compose the 3-LSG. We identify the double degeneracy of the first
excited state as a consequence of swapping transformation symmetry of the
Hamiltonian.

Abstract: We report the development of a cryogenic powder filter that simultaneously
offers high attenuation of radio-frequency (RF) signals in the gigahertz (GHz)
range and minimized parasitic capacitance to ground. Conventional powder
filters, which consist of a signal line passing through a metal powder-filled
housing, attenuate high-frequency signals via the skin effect. However, these
designs often suffer from significant parasitic capacitance between the signal
line and the grounded chassis, which can compromise the performance of
sensitive measurement setups by limiting their frequency bandwidth. In this
work, we demonstrate that a multilayer powder filter design effectively
achieves both high RF attenuation and reduced parasitic capacitance. This
solution suppresses sample heating due to the unintentional intrusion of RF
signals through the wiring, without degrading the performance of the
measurement setup.

Abstract: The linear Edelstein effect is a cornerstone phenomenon in spintronics that
describes the generation of spin magnetization in response to an applied
electric field. Recent theoretical advances have reignited interest in its
nonlinear counterpart, the nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which spin
magnetization is induced by a second-order electric field. However, the
intrinsic contribution to both effects is generally forbidden in systems
preserving time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) or composite symmetries such
as $\mathcal{T}\tau_{1/2}$, where $\tau_{1/2}$ denotes a half-lattice
translation. In such systems, spin magnetization typically emerges either from
extrinsic mechanisms but limited to metals due to their Fermi-surface property,
or from dynamical electric fields with a terahertz driving frequency. Here, we
propose a new mechanism for spin magnetization, arising from the interplay of
magnetic and electric fields, termed the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein
effect. Remarkably, its intrinsic component, determined purely by the
material's band structure, can appear even in $\mathcal{T}$-invariant
materials, but lacking inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{P}$), including
insulators. On the other hand, we illustrate that its extrinsic component can
serve as a sensitive indicator of the N\'eel vector reversal in
$\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials, offering a
novel route for antiferromagnetic order detection. To validate our theory, we
perform explicit calculations using a two-band Dirac model and a tight-binding
model on a honeycomb lattice, finding that both effects yield sizable spin
magnetization. Our findings establish the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein
effect as a versatile platform for both exploring nonlinear spin physics and
enabling symmetry-based detection of antiferromagnetic order.

Abstract: The increasing need for efficient thermal management in nanoelectronics
requires innovative thermal sensing solutions, as conventional sensors often

predict a temperature dependence in the response of existing skyrmion based
spintronic diodes and propose their use as nanoscale thermal sensors. These
devices leverage magnetic skyrmions topologically protected spin textures known
for their robustness, nanoscale dimensions, and low power dynamics. We
demonstrate high thermal sensitivity with a linear temperature response over a
wide range. This linearity, observed in both the amplitude and frequency of the
skyrmion excitation, ensures redundancy that enables precise and reliable
temperature measurement. In addition, the use of multilayer systems enhances
the sensitivity and robustness of the device. These results provide a
foundation for skyrmion-based caloritronic devices with promising applications
in spintronic sensors, thermal management, nanoelectronics, and
skyrmion-caloritronics.

Abstract: Filtering surface acoustic wave (SAW) signals of specified frequencies
depending on the strength of an external magnetic field in a magnetostrictive
material has garnered significant interest due to its potential scientific and
industrial applications. Here, we propose a device that achieves selective SAW
attenuation by instead programming its internal magnetic state. To this end, we
perform micromagnetic simulations for the magnetoelastic interaction of the
Rayleigh SAW mode with spin waves (SWs) in exchange-decoupled Co/Ni islets on a
piezoelectric LiTaO$_3$ substrate. Due to the islets exhibiting perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy, the stray-field interaction between them leads to a shift
in the SW dispersion depending on the magnetic alignment of neighboring islets.
This significantly changes the efficiency of the magnetoelastic interaction at
specified frequencies. We predict changes in SAW transmission of 28.9 dB/mm at
3.8 GHz depending on the state of the device. For the efficient simulation of
the device, we extend a prior energy conservation argument based on analytical
solutions of the SW to finite-difference numerical calculations, enabling the
modeling of arbitrary magnetization patterns like the proposed islet-based
design.

AC-response up to the high-kHz range. Measured hysteresis curves at 100-900 kHz
with up to 110 mT induced $B$-fields in the nanocomposite show that power
losses depend on $B$-field squared, and frequency to the power of 1-1.3. The
only loss mechanism in the nanocomposite is hysteresis losses at $>$100 kHz
frequencies, where the largest particles in the 11$\pm$3 nm distribution
transition from the superparamagnetic to blocked regime. To mitigate the
resulting hysteresis losses (up 10$^2$-10$^5$ kW/m$^3$) a more narrow particle
size distribution could be used for future materials. The presented material is
eddy current-free and easily integrated into micro-fabrication protocols, as we
demonstrate by fabrication of 3-turn print circuit board based inductors with
cast/manual printed nanocomposite inductor cores, on which induction has been
measured up to 100 MHz.

Abstract: Three-terminal electrochemical ionic synapses (EIoS) have recently attracted
interest for in-memory computing applications. These devices utilize
electrochemical ion intercalation to modulate the ion concentration in the
channel material. The electrical conductance, which is concentration dependent,
can be read separately and mapped to a non-volatile memory state. To compete
with other random access memory technologies, linear and symmetric conductance
modulation is often sought after, properties typically thought to be limited by
the slow ion diffusion timescale. A recent study by Onen et al.[1] examining
protonic EIoS with a tungsten oxide (WO3) channel revealed that this limiting
timescale seemed irrelevant, and linear conductance modulation was achieved
over nanosecond timescales, much faster than the bulk ion diffusion. This
contrasts with previous studies that have shown similar conductance modulation
with pulse timescales of milliseconds to seconds. Understanding the phenomena
behind these conductance modulation properties in EIoS systems remains a
crucial question gating technological improvements to these devices. Here, we
provide a theoretical explanation that demonstrates how linearity and symmetry
arise from consistent control over the electrolyte-WO3 interface. Comparing
these past works, changes in the WO3 channel crystallinity were identified,
affecting material thermodynamics and revealing that the device achieving
nanosecond pulse timescales underwent phase separation. Coupling of electric
field polarizatino and increased electron conductivity in high-concentration
filaments, the reaction environment at the gate electrode can be controlled,
resulting in ideal conductance modulation within the diffusion-limited regime.
This work highlights the potential for phase-separating systems to overcome the
traditional diffusion barriers that limit EIoS performance.

Abstract: This work introduces a pseudofractal analysis for optimizing high-resistance
graphene-based quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS). The
development of resistance standard device designs through star-mesh
transformations is detailed, aimed at minimizing element count. Building on a
recent mathematical framework, the approach presented herein refines QHARS
device concepts by considering designs incorporating pseudofractals (which may
be expressed as star-mesh transformations). To understand how future QHARS
pseudofractal designs enable varying sizes of neighborhoods of available
quantized resistance, Minkowski-Bouligand algorithms are used to analyze
fractal dimensions of the device design topologies. Three distinct partial
recursion cases are explored in addition to the original full recursion design,
and expressions for their total element counts are derived. These partial
recursions, assessed through their fractal dimensions, offer enhanced
flexibility in achieving specific resistance values within a desired
neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, albeit with an increased
number of required elements. The formalisms presented are material-independent,
making them broadly applicable to other quantum Hall systems and artifact
standards.

Abstract: The electronic quality of graphene has improved significantly over the past
two decades, revealing novel phenomena. However, even state-of-the-art devices
exhibit substantial spatial charge fluctuations originating from charged
defects inside the encapsulating crystals, limiting their performance. Here, we
overcome this issue by assembling devices in which graphene is encapsulated by
other graphene layers while remaining electronically decoupled from them via a
large twist angle (~10-30{\deg}). Doping of the encapsulating graphene layer
introduces strong Coulomb screening, maximized by the sub-nanometer distance
between the layers, and reduces the inhomogeneity in the adjacent layer to just
a few carriers per square micrometre. The enhanced quality manifests in Landau
quantization emerging at magnetic fields as low as ~5 milli-Tesla and enables
resolution of a small energy gap at the Dirac point. Our encapsulation approach
can be extended to other two-dimensional systems, enabling further exploration
of the electronic properties of ultrapure devices.

Abstract: This work elaborates on how one may develop high-resistance quantized Hall
array resistance standards (QHARS) by using star-mesh transformations for
element count minimization. Refinements are made on a recently developed
mathematical framework optimizing QHARS device designs based on full, symmetric
recursion by reconciling approximate device values with exact effective
quantized resistances found by simulation and measurement. Furthermore, this
work explores the concept of fractal dimension, clarifying the benefits of both
full and partial recursions in QHARS devices. Three distinct partial recursion
cases are visited for a near-1 Gigaohm QHARS device. These partial recursions,
analyzed in the context of their fractal dimensions, offer increased
flexibility in accessing desired resistance values within a specific
neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, though at the cost of the
number of required devices.

Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in employing two key classes of two-dimensional
materials-topological insulators and transition-metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs)-as spin sources for generating spin-orbit torque (SOT), we investigate
current-induced spin polarization and the resulting SOT in bilayers composed of
a TMDC (WSe$_2$ or MoSe$_2$) and ferromagnetic chromium iodide (CrI$_3$),
beyond the linear response regime. Using the steady-state Boltzmann equation,
we find that intra-band transitions yield a strong field-like torque on the
CrI$_3$ layer, while inter-band transitions give rise to a comparatively weaker
damping-like torque in the WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ system. Remarkably, the damping-like
component is enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude in n-doped MoSe$_2$,
reaching a strength comparable to the field-like torque, which itself is an
order of magnitude larger than that in the WSe$_2$-based bilayer. Both torque
components exhibit strong asymmetry between n-type and p-type doping in WSe$_2$
and MoSe$_2$ systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the twist angle plays a
crucial role: depending on the TMDC and chemical potential, twisting can
reverse the sign of the SOT and significantly modulate its magnitude. Finally,
we show that a transverse gate electric field enables substantial tunability of
the SOT, by nearly one order of magnitude, and induces a sign reversal at a
twist angle of $10.16^{\circ}$.

Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich
arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The
physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological
invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored
for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven
scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet
non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological
properties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus
expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and
formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven
quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered
complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust
(despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving
parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to
emergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame
approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when
appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To
substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit
(TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the
skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of
distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance
profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework
for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible
TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.

Abstract: We derive the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle confined to the surface
of a normal and a binormal helical nanoribbon, obtain the quantum potentials
induced by their respective curved surface geometries, and study the localized
states of the particle for each ribbon. When the particle momentum satisfies a
certain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a
normal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result
suggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely
along the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted
as a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse
deflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke
Ehrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized
angular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle
is an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like
voltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall
effect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved
surface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a
binormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron
transport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC
voltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices.
Quantum transport on a helical nanoribbon can be controlled by tuning the bends
and twists of its surface, suggesting diverse applications in biopolymers and
nanotechnology.

Abstract: We analyze quantum interference in the triplet-exciton pair generated by
singlet exciton fission in a molecular crystal, and introduce transport-induced
dephasing (TID) as a key effect that can suppress the expected fluorescence
quantum beats when the triplet-exciton wavefunction can localize on
inequivalent sites. TID depends on the triplet-exciton hopping rate between
inequivalent sites and on the energy-shifts among the stationary states of the
entangled triplet pair in different spatial configurations. The theoretical
model is confirmed by experiments in rubrene single crystals, where triplet
pairs remain entangled for more than 50 ns but quantum beats are suppressed by
TID within a few nanoseconds when the magnetic field is misaligned by just a
few degrees from specific symmetric directions. Our experiments deliver the
zero-field parameters for the rubrene molecule in its orthorhombic lattice and
information on triplet-exciton transport, in particular the triplet-exciton
hopping rate between inequivalent sites, which we evaluate to be of the order
of 150 ps in rubrene.
