On one hand, flat\nbands can arise from strong Coulomb interactions that localize atomic orbitals.\nOn the other hand, quantum destructive interference can quench the electronic\nkinetic energy. Although both have a narrow bandwidth, the two types of flat\nbands should exhibit very distinct spectral properties arising from their\ndistinctive origins. So far, the two types of flat bands have only been\nrealized in very different material settings and chemical environments,\npreventing a direct comparison. Here, we report the observation of the two\ntypes of flat bands within the same material system--an above-room-temperature\nvan der Waals ferromagnet, Fe$_{5-x}$GeTe$_2$, distinguishable by a switchable\niron site order. The contrasting nature of the flat bands is also identified by\nthe remarkably distinctive temperature-evolution of the spectral features,\nindicating that one arises from electron correlations in the Fe(1)\nsite-disordered phase, while the other geometrical frustration in the Fe(1)\nsite-ordered phase. Our results therefore provide a direct juxtaposition of the\ndistinct formation mechanism of flat bands in quantum materials, and an avenue\nfor understanding the distinctive roles flat bands play in the presence of\nmagnetism, topology, and lattice geometrical frustration, utilizing sublattice\nordering as a key control parameter."}

The advent of higher-order topology has generalized this principle to a\nhierarchical chain, enabling topological states to appear at $(D-2)$ or even\nlower-dimensional boundaries. To date, all known realizations of topological\nsystems must require a topologically nontrivial bulk to initiate the chain of\naction for bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, in an acoustic crystal platform,\nwe experimentally demonstrate an exception to this paradigm--embedded topology\nin a trivial bulk--where the bulk-boundary correspondence originates from a\ntrivial bulk. Rather than relying on global symmetries, we employ projective\ncrystal symmetry, which induces nontrivial topology not at the outset in the\n$D$-dimensional bulk, but midway through the correspondence hierarchy in\nlower-dimensional boundaries. We further realize a three-dimensional system\nexhibiting embedded topology that supports zero-dimensional topological states,\nachieving the longest possible chain of action for such an unconventional\nbulk-boundary correspondence in physical space.

For both\nprotocols, we identify parameter regimes for which the thermalization of the\ndriven chain is drastically slowed down due to proximity to a two-rate drive\ninduced exact dynamical freezing.

Based on this, we present a characterization for\noptimal quantum $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs from MP codes with nested constituent codes,\nand also study optimal quantum $(r,\\delta)$-LRCs constructed from MP codes with\nnon-nested constituent codes. Through Hermitian dual-containing and Euclidean\ndual-containing MP codes, we present five infinite families of optimal quantum\n$(r,\\delta)$-LRCs with flexible parameters."}

Such measurements are both ubiquitous in the\nbroader scope of quantum information theory and known to be the most strongly\nnon-projective measurements in qubit systems. Here, we show that beyond qubit\nsystems, the SIC property is in general not associated with the most\nnon-projective measurement. For this, we put forward a semidefinite programming\ncriterion for detecting genuinely non-projective measurements. This method\nallows us to determine quantitative simulability thresholds for generic POVMs\nand to put forward a conjecture on which qutrit and ququart measurements that\nare most strongly non-projective."}

We identify bicircular light as a smoking-gun optical probe for\nchiral altermagnetic magnons, selectively targeting their quantum geometry\ninduced by an alteration of magnonic chirality. We show that in $d$-wave\naltermagnets, under a canting magnetic field, the altermagnetic magnons realize\na nontrivial quantum geometry, resulting in an enhancement of the nonlinear\nsecond-order light-magnon interactions. We find that the scattering of\nbicircular pulses probes the present magnon quantum geometry, even if the\nmagnonic topology is trivial. Hence, our findings establish bicircular Raman\nresponse as an optical effect of choice to identify altermagnetic magnons. As\nsuch, we propose a universal experimental protocol to distinguish altermagnets\nfrom antiferromagnets by detecting their magnon chirality patterns with light,\nindependently of the underlying magnon topology."}

By tuning the\nconnectivity of the graph, the dynamics can be driven from a localized phase\nthrough a chaotic regime to an integrable limit. While this dynamical\ntransition reflects in the spectral characteristics, we pursue a broader suite\nof quantum chaos indicators,some of which can be measured on near-term quantum\ndevices. We study deep thermalization of a quantum state ensemble obtained from\na natural unraveling of the subsystem density matrix as an indicator of chaotic\ndynamics. This extends the analysis of quantum chaos to the ensemble of quantum\nstates. Furthermore, we analyze the eigenstate and eigenvalue correlations\nthrough the partial spectral form factor of subsystems and observe distinct\nsignatures of the onset of chaos and its system size dependence, providing\nexperimentally measurable indicators of the localization-to-chaos transition.\nAs a locality-independent probe, we show that the Krylov complexity of\noperators is also maximized in the chaotic regime, providing a link between\ngraph topology and information scrambling. Finally, we investigate a quantum\nanalogue of the Mpemba effect, where initially \"hotter\" states can thermalize\nanomalously fast, a phenomenon most cleanly observed within the chaotic phase.\nHowever, away from the chaotic regime, the system is distinguished by multiple\ncrossings across connectivity in its distance from the thermal ensemble with\ntime. Collectively, this work presents a broad characterization of chaos,\nproviding insight beyond spectral analysis and practical indicators for\nbenchmarking near-term quantum devices."}
