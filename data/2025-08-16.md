  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该方法为量子电路的优化和算法验证提供了一种高效的近似分析工具。

Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum systems, essential for
non-trivial quantum programs. Identifying when qubits become entangled is
critical for circuit optimization, and for arguing for the correctness of
quantum algorithms. This paper presents a static analysis method for
approximating entanglement by extending an already existing abstract
interpretation, thus avoiding the exponential slowdown of an exact analysis.
The approach is shown to be sound and an implementation is provided in Standard
ML with linear-time scalability.

### [2] [On the role of overparametrization in Quantum Approximate Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10086)
*Daniil Rabinovich,Andrey Kardashin,Soumik Adhikary*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了变分量子算法中过参数化对性能的影响，重点分析了QAOA算法在MAX-CUT和MAX-2-SAT问题中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索确定变分量子算法所需最小量子资源的问题，尤其是过参数化的作用。

Method: 基于经典机器学习的启发，研究QAOA算法在MAX-CUT和MAX-2-SAT问题中的过参数化需求。

Result: MAX-CUT问题中过参数化是必要且充分的；MAX-2-SAT问题中欠参数化即可解决多数实例。

Conclusion: QAOA在欠参数化情况下仍具潜力，适用于当前噪声设备。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary
quantum algorithms research. While they have demonstrated considerable promise
in solving problems of practical interest, efficiently determining the minimal
quantum resources necessary to obtain such a solution remains an open question.
In this work, inspired by concepts from classical machine learning, we
investigate the impact of overparameterization on the performance of
variational algorithms. Our study focuses on the quantum approximate
optimization algorithm (QAOA) -- a prominent variational quantum algorithm
designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. We investigate if
circuit overparametrization is necessary and sufficient to solve such problems
in QAOA, considering two representative problems -- MAX-CUT and MAX-2-SAT. For
MAX-CUT we observe that overparametriation is both sufficient and
(statistically) necessary for attaining exact solutions, as confirmed
numerically for up to $20$ qubits. In fact, for MAX-CUT on 2-regular graphs we
show the necessity to be exact, based on the analytically found optimal depth.
In sharp contrast, for MAX-2-SAT, underparametrized circuits suffice to solve
most instances. This result highlights the potential of QAOA in the
underparametrized regime, supporting its utility for current noisy devices.

### [3] [Quantum circuit simulation with a local time-dependent variational principle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10096)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于局部时间依赖变分原理（TDVP）的矩阵乘积态（MPS）电路模拟方法，解决了传统TEBD算法的局限性，显著降低了资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TEBD算法在模拟量子电路时面临纠缠增加导致的资源指数增长问题，尤其是长程门操作的高成本。

Method: 将量子电路重新解释为离散时间演化序列，利用门生成器通过局部TDVP构建MPS模拟，优化状态表示并减少资源需求。

Result: 在49量子比特电路上的测试表明，新方法显著降低了内存和运行时间成本，优于现有工具。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子电路模拟设定了新的技术标准，推动了量子计算和凝聚态物理等领域的发展。

Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits are vital for assessing potential
quantum advantage and benchmarking devices, yet they require sophisticated
methods to avoid the exponential growth of resources. Tensor network
approaches, in particular matrix product states (MPS) combined with the
time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, currently dominate large-scale
circuit simulations. These methods scale efficiently when entanglement is
limited but suffer rapid bond dimension growth with increasing entanglement and
handle long-range gates via costly SWAP insertions. Motivated by the success of
the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) in many-body physics, we
reinterpret quantum circuits as a series of discrete time evolutions, using
gate generators to construct an MPS-based circuit simulation via a local TDVP
formulation. This addresses TEBD's key limitations by (1) naturally
accommodating long-range gates and (2) optimally representing states on the MPS
manifold. By diffusing entanglement more globally, the method suppresses local
bond growth and reduces memory and runtime costs. We benchmark the approach on
five 49-qubit circuits: three Hamiltonian circuits (1D open and periodic
Heisenberg, 2D 7x7 Ising) and two algorithmic ones (quantum approximate
optimization, hardware-efficient ansatz). Across all cases, our method yields
substantial resource reductions over standard tools, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for circuit simulation and enabling advances across quantum
computing, condensed matter, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 结合Majorana算符代数和稳定子形式，提出基于时间依赖Pfaffian形式的高效数值模拟方法。

Result: 开发了一种支持经典模拟的计算工具包，适用于包含编织、投影测量和无序的实际设备架构。

Conclusion: 提供了理论和计算工具，支持进一步研究拓扑量子计算平台。

Abstract: We summarize the key ingredients required for universal topological quantum
computation using Majorana zero modes in networks of topological superconductor
nanowires. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of both sparse and dense
logical qubit encodings, and on the transitions between them via projective
parity measurements. Combined with hybridization, these operations extend the
computational capabilities beyond braiding alone and enable universal gate
sets. In addition to outlining the theoretical foundations-including the
algebra of Majorana operators, along with the stabilizer formalism-we introduce
an efficient numerical method for simulating the time-dependent dynamics of
such systems. This method, based on the time dependent Pfaffian formalism,
allows for the classical simulation of realistic device architectures that
incorporate braiding, projective measurements, and disorder. The result is a
semi-pedagogical overview and computational toolbox designed to support further
exploration of topological quantum computing platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决拓扑量子计算中多量子比特扩展时编织操作无法支持完整Clifford群的问题。

Method: 结合编织操作和投影测量，实现量子比特编码的切换，并通过多体模拟验证。

Result: 成功制备了Bell态和GHZ态，五量子比特随机电路保真度超过99%，并在十量子比特系统中展示了可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法具有内在容错性，适用于大规模量子计算。

Abstract: Topological quantum computing promises intrinsic fault tolerance by encoding
quantum information in non-Abelian anyons, where quantum gates are implemented
via braiding. While braiding operations are robust against local perturbations,
a critical yet often overlooked challenge arises when scaling beyond two
qubits: the naive extension of braiding based gates fails to support even the
full Clifford group. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate projective
measurements that enable transitions between different qubit encodings, thus
restoring computational universality. We perform many-body simulations of
braiding dynamics augmented with measurement-based switching, explicitly
preparing the Bell state and GHZ state for systems of two and five qubits,
respectively. Furthermore, we execute a random unitary circuit on five qubits,
achieving a fidelity exceeding 99%. We analyze the circuit's robustness by
studying its fidelity dependence on total braid duration and static potential
disorder. Our results show that the fidelity remains above 99% for moderate
disorder, underscoring the intrinsic fault tolerance of the architecture.
Finally, we demonstrate a random circuit on a ten qubit system to showcase the
scalability of our techniques.

### [6] [Exploring the topology of a non-Hermitian superconducting qubit using shortcuts to adiabaticity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10122)

Result: 实验表明反绝热驱动能稳定准静态传输并保持复杂能谱的拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 反绝热驱动是一种有效方法，可在非厄米系统中实现快速绝热演化并保持拓扑特性。

Abstract: Open quantum systems described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian exhibit rich
dynamics due to the topology of their complex energy spectrum. By encircling an
exceptional point degeneracy, this topology allows for topological state
transport, chiral geometric phases, and eigenvalue braiding. To access these
topological features, it is desirable to drive the system adiabatically.
However, adiabatic transport in a system with complex spectrum is
conventionally only possible for the eigenstate whose eigenenergy has the
lowest loss. Previous experiments have demonstrated such adiabatic evolution
for the quantum state with relative gain, yet observed a breakdown in
adiabaticity for quantum states with relative loss. In this work, we harness a
shortcut to adiabaticity -- counterdiabatic driving -- to avoid the effects of
loss while maintaining trajectories that follow the instantaneous eigenstates
in significantly shorter timescales. We experimentally investigate the
robustness of this control method using a superconducting transmon circuit with
engineered dissipation. We observe that counterdiabatic driving stabilizes
quasistatic transport and preserves the complex energy spectrum's topology.

equation. This research was conducted under the supervision of Benoit Valiron

### [9] [Metrological power of single-qubit dynamical Casimir effect in circuit QED](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10182)

Result: 量子Fisher信息显著超过相同平均光子数下的经典极限，即使在耗散存在时仍保持优势。

Conclusion: 适当的参数调制不仅能模拟动态卡西米尔效应，还能生成具有计量优势的非经典光态。

Abstract: We consider a nonstationary circuit QED system described by the quantum Rabi
model, in which an artificial two-level atom with a tunable transition
frequency is coupled to a single-mode resonator. We focus on regimes where the
external modulation takes the form $\sin[\eta(t) t]$, with the modulation
frequency $\eta(t)$ varying slowly and linearly in time near $2\nu$ and $4\nu$,
$\nu$ being the resonator frequency. Starting from the vacuum state, we
numerically compute the Quantum Fisher Information for single-mode phase and
displacement estimation, showing that it significantly exceeds the classical
limits for the same average photon number, even in the presence of dissipation.
Thus, appropriate parametric modulation of the qubit not only simulates the
dynamical Casimir effect but also enables the generation of nonclassical states
of light that offer a metrological advantage over classical states of
equivalent energy.

### [10] [Variational Time Evolution Compression for Solving Impurity Models on Quantum Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10526)
*Stefan Wolf,Martin Eckstein,Michael J. Hartmann*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于变分量子算法的DMFT方法，通过训练哈密顿变分拟设近似时间演化算子，显著减少了电路深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DMFT是分析强关联费米子模型的有用工具，但传统方法需要复杂的量子计算资源。本文旨在开发一种更高效的量子-经典混合算法。

Result: 提出的方法生成了恒定深度的电路，显著浅于传统Suzuki-Trotter展开。

Conclusion: 该方法为DMFT中的量子计算提供了更高效的实现路径，减少了资源需求。

Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a useful tool to analyze models of
strongly correlated fermions like the Hubbard model. In DMFT, the lattice of
the model is replaced by a single impurity site embedded in an effective bath.
The resulting single impurity Anderson model (SIAM) can then be solved
self-consistently with a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm. This procedure
involves repeatedly preparing the ground state on a quantum computer and
evolving it in time to measure the Greens function. We here develop an
approximation of the time evolution operator for this setting by training a
Hamiltonian variational ansatz. The parameters of the ansatz are obtained via a
variational quantum algorithm that utilizes a small number of time steps, given
by the Suzuki- Trotter expansion of the time evolution operator, to guide the
evolution of the parameters. The resulting circuit has constant depth for the
time evolution and is significantly shallower than a comparable Suzuki-Trotter
expansion.

Conclusion: 该技术为自由空间和卫星通信中的频率纠缠光子提供了资源高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Frequency-bin entangled photons can be efficiently produced on-chip which
offers a scalable, robust and low-footprint platform for quantum communication,
particularly well-suited for resource-constrained settings such as mobile or
satellite-based systems. However, analyzing such entangled states typically
requires active and lossy components, limiting scalability and multi-mode
compatibility. We demonstrate a novel technique for processing
frequency-encoded photons using linear interferometry and time-resolved
detection. Our approach is fully passive and compatible with spatially
multi-mode light, making it suitable for free-space and satellite to ground
applications. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize frequency-bin entangled photons
generated from a high-brightness multi-resonator source integrated on-chip to
show the ability to perform arbitrary projective measurements over both single-
and multi-mode channels. We report the first measurement of the joint temporal
intensity between frequency-bin entangled photons, which allows us to certify
entanglement by violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality,
with a measured value of $|S|=2.32\pm0.05$ over multi-mode fiber. By combining
time-resolved detection with energy-correlation measurements, we perform full
quantum state tomography, yielding a state fidelity of up to $91\%$. We further
assess our ability to produce non-classical states via a violation of
time-energy entropic uncertainty relations and investigate the feasibility of a
quantum key distribution protocol. Our work establishes a resource-efficient
and scalable approach toward the deployment of robust frequency-bin
entanglement over free-space and satellite-based links.

Abstract: Highly-efficient quantum memories are essential for advancing quantum
information processing technologies, including scalable quantum computing and
quantum networks. We experimentally demonstrate a light storage and retrieval
protocol in a tripod system using an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms.
The tripod system, which consists of three ground states and an excited state,
offers rich dynamics: its use to coherently store and retrieve a weak probe
pulse in the $^{87}$Rb $F=1$ ground state manifold leads to the interference of
two spin-wave excitations during storage time that translate to an interference
in the peak intensity of the retrieved probe pulse. Our work shows that these
interferences, which manifest when varying the pulse sequence or energy level
structure, can be controlled experimentally by varying the storage time,
optical phase, and magnetic field strength. Theoretical simulations exhibit
excellent agreement with the experimental results. This work demonstrates the
rich dynamics and versatile capabilities of atomic tripod systems for light
storage and retrieval, with key advantages over conventional $\Lambda$-systems,
highlighting the potential of atomic tripod systems for applications in quantum
information processing, quantum synchronization, and atomic memory protocols.

Abstract: The superradiant phase transition in the dissipative Dicke lattice model,
driven by on-site collective atom-photon interactions and inter-site photon
hopping, is a cornerstone of nonequilibrium quantum many-body physics. However,
little is still known about the influence of boundaries in experimental
achievable systems of finite size. Here we investigate the dissipative
superradiant phase transition in the Dicke lattice model with a small number of
sites and reveal a striking sensitivity of this model to the nature of the
boundary conditions. Specifically, we find that under open boundary conditions
a whole zoo of superradiant phases with broken translational symmetry appears,
which is not observed in the corresponding infinite lattice system. Our results
demonstrate the crucial influence of boundary effects on the stationary phases
of dissipative lattice models, which offers intriguing new opportunities for
studying these phenomena in near term experimental realizations of such models
in quantum optics and circuit QED.

Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) is an important resource in quantum
information processing. We systematically study the measures of GME based on
the geometric mean of bi-partition entanglements and present a unified
construction of GME measures, which gives rise to the widely used GME measures
including GME concurrence, the convex-roof extended negativity of GME, the
geometric measure of entanglement of GME. Our GME measures satisfy the
desirable conditions such as scalability and smoothness. Moreover, we provide
fidelity-based analytical lower bounds for our GME measures. Our bounds are
tight and can be estimated experiment friendly without requiring quantum state
tomography. Furthermore, we apply our results to study the dynamics of GME. We
identify an initial condition that influences the sudden death of genuine
quadripartite entanglement under individual non-Markovian processes. The GME of
Dirac particles with Hawking radiation in the background of a Schwarzschild
black hole is also investigated.

Conclusion: 新算法有效解决了波前误差问题，为卫星对地CV-QKD提供了更高的安全密钥率。

Abstract: State-of-the-art free-space continuous-variable quantum key distribution
(CV-QKD) protocols use phase reference pulses to modulate the wavefront of a
real local oscillator at the receiver, thereby compensating for wavefront
distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence. It is normally assumed that the
wavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the
wavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during
transmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a
relative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum
signals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key
transfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine
learning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light
conversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into
the Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase
measurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed
simulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new
algorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may
exist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference
pulses and quantum signals. We quantify the gains available in our algorithm in
terms of the CV-QKD secure key rate. We show channels where positive secure key
rates are obtained using our algorithms, while information loss without
wavefront correction would result in null key rates.

Conclusion: 提出的几何QSL为虚时间演化提供了普适的理论工具，并在具体问题中展示了其应用价值。

Abstract: We derive a Geometric quantum speed limit (QSL) for imaginary-time evolution,
where the dynamics is governed by a non-unitary Schr\"{o}dinger equation. By
introducing a cost function based on the angular distance between the
normalized evolving state and the initial state, we obtain a lower bound on the
evolution time expressed as the ratio between this angle and the time-averaged
energy dispersion. Our bound is analytical, general, and applicable to
arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonians. We analytically evaluate this bound
for two physically motivated cases. First, we apply it to a two-level system
and derive an expression for the minimal time. Second, we analyze the
imaginary-time version of Grover search problem and rigorously reproduce the
well-known logarithmic scaling $T=\mathcal{ O}(\log N)$ within our QSL
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一量子理论和引力理论需要验证GUP及其参数β_0，但现有方法受限于能量尺度和分辨率。

Conclusion: 该方法为低能量尺度下测量GUP提供了可行方案，支持量子引力理论的建立。

Abstract: Several theories that attempt to unify quantum theory and gravitational
theory assume that space has an observable limiting resolution related to the
Planck length, denoted by $\sqrt{\beta_0}L_p$. Quantum mechanically, this
concept derives a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and the corresponding
modified commutator. The prediction and observation of GUP-induced new physics,
as well as the quantitative measurement of the value of $\beta_0$, may provide
substantial support for the establishment of quantum gravity theory. In this
paper, we propose a comprehensive quantum framework for measuring GUP at low
energy scales by utilizing the interference-induced bright-dark mode effect of
oscillators in an optomechanical system. The nonlinearity induced by GUP will
be amplified by the bright mode dynamics, and then be quantitatively read out
by the noise spectrum of the dark mode. The measurement limit resolution of the
scheme is not constrained by the quality factor of the oscillator. Under
experimentally achievable parameters, the measurement resolution has been shown
to reach $\beta_{\text{NL,lim}}=10^{-16.75}$, which is $10$ orders of magnitude
lower than the electroweak level.

Motivation: 探讨二叉树网络在分布式量子远程传输中的性能，以及方向性和对称性对传输能力的影响。

Method: 使用简单的Werner态模型，分析四种二叉树网络（有向/无向、对称/非对称）的平均最大远程传输保真度。

Result: 发现对称有向二叉树网络性能最佳，并确定了量子优势的参数范围。

Conclusion: 对称有向二叉树网络是传输量子信息的最佳拓扑结构。

Abstract: The idea of average of maximum teleportation fidelities was introduced in [1]
to measure the capability of the network to act as a resource for distributed
teleportation between any pair of nodes. Binary tree network, being a subclass
of Cayley tree network, is a significant topological structure used for
information transfer in a hierarchical sense. In this article, we consider four
types of binary tree repeater networks (directed and undirected, asymmetric and
symmetric) and obtain the analytical expressions of the average of the maximum
teleportation fidelities for each of these binary tree networks. Our work
investigates the role of directionality and symmetry in this measure. Like [1],
here also we have used simple Werner state-based models and are able to
identify the parameter ranges for which these networks can show quantum
advantage. We explore the role of maximally entangled states in the network to
enhance the quantum advantage. We explore the large $N$ (nodes) scenario for
each of these networks and find out the limiting value of the average of the
maximum teleportation fidelity for each of these networks. We also include the
scenarios when the Werner state parameters for each link are different and
chosen from a uniform distribution. According to our analysis, the directed
symmetric binary tree is the most beneficial topology in this context. Our
results pave the way to identify the resourceful network in transmitting
quantum information.

intercept and resend attack is implemented with simultaneous homodyne
measurement in both quadratures and the resulting secure key gains are
calculated showing a significative increase with dimension.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于BB84协议，还可支持多种QKD协议，是研究和实际部署安全量子通信系统的宝贵工具。

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is rapidly transitioning from cutting-edge
laboratory research to real-world deployment in established communication
networks. Although QKD promises future-proof security, practical challenges
stil exist due to imperfections in physical devices. Many protocols offer
strong security guarantees, but their implementation can be complex and
difficult. To bridge this gap, we present a practical and systematic framework
for implementing QKD, focused on the BB84 protocol but designed with broader
applicability in mind. The article includes key concepts for device
calibration, synchronisation,optical alignment, and key post-processing. We
outline a simple algorithm for key sifting that is easily implementable in
hardware. Our results highlight the importance of selecting the temporal window
to optimise both the key rate and the quantum bit error rate (QBER). In
addition, we show that random sampling of the sifted key bits for error
estimation yields more reliable results than sequential sampling. We also
integrate the Entrapped Pulse Coincidence Detection (EPCD) protocol to boost
key generation rates, further enhancing performance. Although our work focuses
on BB84, the techniques and practices outlined are general enough to support a
wide range of QKD protocols. This makes our framework a valuable tool for both
research and real-world deployment of secure quantum communication systems.

Abstract: Macroscopic quantum superpositions, such as mechanical Schr\"odinger cat
states, are central to emerging quantum technologies in sensing and bosonic
error-correcting codes. We propose a scheme to generate such states by coupling
a nanomechanical resonator to a coherently driven two-level system via both
transverse and longitudinal interactions. Driving the qubit at twice the
oscillator frequency activates resonant two-phonon exchange processes, enabling
coherent conversion of drive energy into phonon pairs and their dissipative
stabilization. Starting from the full time-dependent Hamiltonian, we derive an
effective master equation for the mechanical mode by perturbative elimination
of the lossy qubit. The reduced dynamics feature engineered two-phonon loss and
a coherent squeezing term, which together drive the resonator into a
deterministic Schr\"odinger-cat state. Our approach requires only a single
driven qubit and no auxiliary cavity, offering a scalable and experimentally
accessible route to macroscopic quantum superpositions in circuit-QED and
related platforms.

Abstract: To leverage the potential computational speedup of quantum computing (QC),
research in quantum machine learning (QML) has gained increasing prominence.
Angle encoding techniques in QML models have been shown to generate truncated
Fourier series, offering asymptotically universal function approximation
capabilities. By selecting efficient feature maps (FMs) within quantum
circuits, one can leverage the exponential growth of Fourier frequencies for
improved approximation. In multi-dimensional settings, additional input
dimensions induce further exponential scaling via mixed frequencies. In
practice, however, quantum models frequently fail at regression tasks. Through
two white-box experiments, we show that such failures can occur even when the
relevant frequencies are present, due to an insufficient number of trainable
parameters.
  In order to mitigate the double-exponential parameter growth resulting from
double-exponentially growing frequencies, we propose frequency selection and
dimensional separation as techniques to constrain the number of parameters,
thereby improving trainability. By restricting the QML model to essential
frequencies and permitting mixed frequencies only among feature dimensions with
known interdependence, we expand the set of tractable problems on current
hardware. We demonstrate the reduced parameter requirements by fitting two
white-box functions with known frequency spectrum and dimensional
interdependencies that could not be fitted with the default methods. The
reduced parameter requirements permit us to perform training on a noisy quantum
simulator and to demonstrate inference on real quantum hardware.

Abstract: Recent advances in nanoscale and microscale photon-pair sources have enabled
quantum-light-matter interactions in regimes where standard approximations,
such as the paraxial limit, break down. Identifying quantum advantages in these
domains requires a unified, first-principles framework that treats arbitrary
quantum states of light and realistic material systems without restrictive
assumptions. Here, we present a fully relativistic, beyond-paraxial theory of
multiphoton ionization driven by quantum light, incorporating the full spatial
structure and correlations of the field alongside material properties. As a
case study, we apply the formalism to resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization
(REMPI) of neutral sodium atoms by momentum-entangled photons. We predict
cross-section enhancements of several orders of magnitude compared to coherent
light, arising entirely from non-paraxial effects and vanishing in the paraxial
limit. The enhancement is strongly channel-dependent, with odd multipole
transitions benefiting most from favorable parity and interference conditions.
The predicted enhancement is accessible with current state-of-the-art photonic
and atomic technologies, highlighting a promising avenue for exploiting quantum
light in high-precision ionization and spectroscopy experiments.

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为量子计算机作为测试量子力学基本问题的工具提供了可重复的协议和参考。

Abstract: We present a quantum computing simulation study of mass-dependent decoherence
models inspired by Penrose's gravity-induced collapse hypothesis. According to
objective reduction (OR) theory, quantum superpositions become unstable when
the gravitational self-energy difference between branches exceeds a certain
threshold, leading to a collapse time $\tau \approx \hbar / E_G$. In this work,
we implement a mass-dependent dephasing noise channel, $p(m) = 1 - e^{-k
m^{\alpha}}$, within the Qiskit AerSimulator, where $m$ is a proxy for the
effective mass of a superposition, mapped to circuit parameters such as the
number of entangled qubits or branch size. We apply this model to three
canonical quantum computing experiments: GHZ state parity measurements,
branch-mass entanglement tests, and Grover's search to generate distinctive
collapse signatures that differ qualitatively from constant-rate dephasing. The
resulting patterns serve as a baseline reference: if future hardware
experiments exhibit the same scaling trends under ideal isolation, this could
indicate a contribution from mass-dependent collapse processes. Conversely,
deviation toward constant-noise behaviour would suggest the absence of such
gravitationally induced effects. Our results provide a reproducible protocol
and reference for using quantum computers as potential testbeds for probing
fundamental questions in quantum mechanics.

Motivation: 传统VQE方法（如UCC ansatz）电路深度较大，希望通过量子信息理论量设计更高效的ansatz。

Method: 利用目标态的量子信息（冯·诺依曼熵和量子互信息）设计电路块，确定量子比特对的最大相关性，从而放置两比特纠缠门。

Result: 在12量子比特的无噪声计算中，提出的ansatz仅需两个电路块，比UCC ansatz减少99%的两比特门，且精度达99.99%。

Conclusion: 该ansatz在减少电路深度的同时保持了高精度，为量子计算中的基态能量计算提供了高效方法。

Abstract: We present a quantum information-inspired ansatz for the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) and demonstrate its efficacy in calculating ground-state
energies of atomic systems. Instead of adopting a heuristic approach, we start
with an approximate multi-qubit target state and utilize two quantum
information-theoretic quantities, i.e., von Neumann entropy and quantum mutual
information, to construct our ansatz. The quantum information encoded in the
target state helps us to design unique blocks and identify qubit pairs that
share maximum quantum correlations among them in the multi-qubit system,
thereby enabling us to deterministically place two-qubit entanglers in the
suitably constructed parametrized quantum circuit. We find that our approach
has the advantage of reduced circuit depth compared to the unitary
coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz (the gold standard for VQE), and yet yields
accurate results. To test the performance of our ansatz, we apply it to compute
ground-state energies of atomic systems. We find that for up to 12 qubits (or
12 spin orbitals) noiseless calculation, the proposed ansatz yields energies
with 99.99% accuracy relative to the complete active space configuration
interaction values, while utilizing only two blocks, which contain at most 99%
fewer 2-qubit gates than the UCC ansatz.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can distribute keys with guaranteed security
but remains susceptible to key exchange interruption due to physical-layer
threats, such as high-power jamming attacks. To address this challenge, we
first introduce a novel metric, namely Maximum Number of Affected Requests
(maxNAR), to quantify the worst-case impact of a single physical-layer attack,
and then we investigate a new problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment with
Minimal Attack Radius (RWA-MAR). We formulate the problem using an Integer
Linear Programming (ILP) model and propose a scalable heuristic to efficiently
minimize maxNAR. Our approach incorporates key caching through Quantum Key
Pools (QKPs) to enhance resilience and optimize resource utilization. Moreover,
we model the impact of different QKD network architectures, employing Optical
Bypass (OB) for optical switching of quantum channels and Trusted Relay (TR)
for secure key forwarding. Moreover, a tunable parameter is designed in the
heuristic to guide the preference for OB or TR, offering enhanced adaptability
and dynamic control in diverse network scenarios. Simulation results confirm
that our method significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of security and
scalability.

Abstract: In classical mechanics and electromagnetism, interference occurs when two or
more waves overlap at the same point in spacetime. However, the advent of
quantum electrodynamics (QED) and its remarkable success in describing
light-matter interactions at the microscopic level invites us to reconsider
whether interference-like effects could arise even when the waves do not
physically overlap. In this work, we extend the notion of wave interference to
a novel and unconventional regime. Building upon the fundamental description of
interference in terms of the interaction with the observer [Phys. Rev. Lett.
134, 133603 (2025)], we demonstrate that interference-like phenomena can emerge
when two independent fields interact with a single detector at different
locations in Minkowski space. We begin by developing a theoretical model in
which a spatially extended atom simultaneously couples to two distant fields.
We then propose an experimentally feasible implementation using superconducting
circuits, where a giant artificial atom interacts with two independent
resonators. Our findings open new directions for exploring interference in
quantum systems and suggest new possibilities for optical quantum technologies,
including the realization of atom-transparent devices controlled by spatially
separated laser fields.

Abstract: The low-energy isomeric transition in Thorium-229 offers a unique interface
between nuclear and atomic physics, presenting a resource for quantum
technologies that is notably resilient to environmental decoherence. While
early experiments focused on nuclei in solid-state crystals, the recent advent
of a continuous-wave vacuum ultraviolet laser at 148.4~nm now enables direct
coherent control of individual trapped Th-229 ions. Building on this
breakthrough, we present a theoretical framework for utilizing trapped
Th-229^{3+} ions as high-fidelity nuclear-level qubits, wherein quantum state
preparation, single-qubit control, and entangling operations based on nuclear
energy levels can all be efficiently realized. We analyze a scheme to generate
entanglement between the nuclear isomeric states of two ions through
phonon-mediated coupling, driven by optimized red- and blue-detuned laser
sideband pulses. Our analysis, grounded in realistic experimental parameters,
also demonstrates that high-fidelity entanglement is achievable, leveraging the
nucleus's intrinsically long coherence times. These results provide a practical
roadmap for developing nuclear-based quantum information processors and suggest
that entangled nuclear-level qubits could potentially unlock new frontiers in
precision metrology.

Abstract: Finding the ground state of Ising spin glasses is notoriously difficult due
to disorder and frustration. Often, this challenge is framed as a combinatorial
optimization problem, for which a common strategy employs simulated annealing,
a Monte Carlo (MC)-based algorithm that updates spins one at a time. Yet, these
localized updates can cause the system to become trapped in local minima.
Cluster algorithms (CAs) were developed to address this limitation and have
demonstrated considerable success in studying ferromagnetic systems; however,
they tend to encounter percolation issues when applied to generic spin glasses.
  In this work, we introduce a novel CA designed to tackle these challenges by
leveraging precomputed two-point correlations, aiming solve combinatorial
optimization problems in the form of Max-Cut more efficiently. In our approach,
clusters are formed probabilistically based on these correlations. Various
classical and quantum algorithms can be employed to generate correlations that
embody information about the energy landscape of the problem. By utilizing this
information, the algorithm aims to identify groups of spins whose simultaneous
flipping induces large transitions in configuration space with high acceptance
probability -- even at low energy levels -- thereby escaping local minima more
effectively.
  Notably, clusters generated using correlations from the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm exhibit high acceptance rates at low temperatures. These
acceptance rates often increase with circuit depth, accelerating the algorithm
and enabling more efficient exploration of the solution space.

Abstract: We explore the potential application of quantum annealing to address the
protein structure problem. To this end, we compare several proposed ab initio
protein folding models for quantum computers and analyze their scaling and
performance for classical and quantum heuristics. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel encoding of coordinate based models on the tetrahedral lattice, based on
interleaved grids. Our findings reveal significant variations in model
performance, with one model yielding unphysical configurations within the
feasible solution space. Furthermore, we conclude that current quantum
annealing hardware is not yet suited for tackling problems beyond a
proof-of-concept size, primarily due to challenges in the embedding.
Nonetheless, we observe a scaling advantage over our in-house simulated
annealing implementation, which, however, is only noticeable when comparing
performance on the embedded problems.

Abstract: We propose the construction of equations of motion based on symmetries in
quantum-mechanical systems, using Heisenberg's uncertainty principle as a
minimal foundation. From canonical operators, two spaces of conjugate operators
are constructed, along with a third space derived from the former, which
includes the ``Symmetry-Dilation'' operator. When this operator commutes with
the main equation of motion, it defines the set of observables compatible with
a complete basis of operators (symmetry generators), organized into a Lie
algebra dependent on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle within Minkowski
spacetime. Furthermore, by requiring the dilation operator to commute with the
central operator, the wavefunction is constrained, thereby constructing known
structures. Specific cases are derived -- relativistic, non-relativistic, and a
lesser-studied case: ``ultra-relativistic (Carroll-Schr\"odinger)''. Our work
may open new avenues for understanding and classifying symmetries in quantum
mechanics, as well as offer an alternative method for deriving equations of

Conclusion: 通过矩阵分析工具，成功解决了经典-量子通道中的比特保留和正交性优化问题，并证明了其计算复杂性。

Abstract: We prove that deciding whether a classical-quantum (C-Q) channel can exactly
preserve a single classical bit is QCMA-complete. This "bit-preservation"
problem is a special case of orthogonality-constrained optimization tasks over
C-Q channels, in which one seeks orthogonal input states whose outputs have
small or large Hilbert-Schmidt overlap after passing through the channel. Both
problems can be cast as biquadratic optimization with orthogonality
constraints. Our main technical contribution uses tools from matrix analysis to
give a complete characterization of the optimal witnesses: computational basis
states for the minimum, and |+>, |-> over a single basis pair for the maximum.
Using this characterization, we give concise proofs of QCMA-completeness for
both problems.

Abstract: Scientific progress is tightly coupled to the emergence of new research
tools. Today, machine learning (ML)-especially deep learning (DL)-has become a
transformative instrument for quantum science and technology. Owing to the
intrinsic complexity of quantum systems, DL enables efficient exploration of
large parameter spaces, extraction of patterns from experimental data, and
data-driven guidance for research directions. These capabilities already
support tasks such as refining quantum control protocols and accelerating the
discovery of materials with targeted quantum properties, making ML/DL literacy
an essential skill for the next generation of quantum scientists. At the same
time, DL's power brings risks: models can overfit noisy data, obscure causal
structure, and yield results with limited physical interpretability.
Recognizing these limitations and deploying mitigation strategies is crucial
for scientific rigor. These lecture notes provide a comprehensive,
graduate-level introduction to DL for quantum applications, combining
conceptual exposition with hands-on examples. Organized as a progressive
sequence, they aim to equip readers to decide when and how to apply DL
effectively, to understand its practical constraints, and to adapt AI methods
responsibly to problems across quantum physics, chemistry, and engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多量子源网络中测量不兼容性对非局域性的作用，揭示不同拓扑结构下的资源需求差异。

Method: 通过分析标准和非标准量子网络，比较不同拓扑结构（如线性网络和星形网络）中测量不兼容性与非局域性的关系。

Result: 在线性网络中，即使所有方测量兼容也能产生非n-局域性；而在星形网络中，至少一方需测量不兼容。非标准网络中，所有方需测量不兼容才能产生真正的非n-局域性。

Conclusion: 测量不兼容性在不同拓扑结构中对非局域性的作用不同，更强的非经典性需要更多资源。

Abstract: It is a well-known fact that measurement incompatibility is a necessary
resource to generate nonlocal correlations in usual Bell scenario that
typically involves single quantum source. We can provide with some contrasting
findings if we consider connected structure of multiple quantum sources.
Precisely, we demonstrate that non n-locality can be detected in standard
quantum network even when only a single party performs incompatible
measurements. More interestingly, for any finite n greater than 2, non n-local
correlations can be generated in any standard linear n-local network when all
the parties perform compatible measurements. Such an observation is topology
specific as one of the parties must perform incompatible measurement to exhibit
non n-locality in any non-linear network endowed with star topology. However,
we observe that in any non-standard network(all sources independent and
nonlocal), to generate genuine non n-local correlations, all the parties must
perform incompatible measurements. Such a finding is intuitive as more resource
is required to generate stronger form of quantum non-classicality. We also
demonstrate that merely providing resource of measurement incompatibility to
all the parties is not sufficient for non n-locality detection in any quantum
network

Result: 最大输出功和效率出现在超辐射相变点附近，调节Stark场强度可显著提升性能，不对称热机设计更优。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高性能量子热机的设计提供了理论支持，特别是通过参数调节和不对称设计优化性能。

Abstract: We propose a quantum Otto heat engine that employs a finite-size Dicke-Stark
model as the working substance. In the extended coherent state space, the
complete energy spectrum and eigenstates of this model are obtained through
numerical calculations. Within the infinite-time and finite-time thermodynamics
frameworks, we investigate the effects of the Stark field strength, coupling
strength, adiabatic stroke time, isochoric stroke time, and number of atoms in
the DS model on the heat engine's output work, efficiency, and power. The
results show that the maximum values of the output work and efficiency appear
near the coupling strength corresponding to the superradiant phase transition
point. Regulating the Stark field strength can tune the energy level structure
of the system and the superradiant phase transition, effectively reducing
entropy generation and quantum friction during nonequilibrium evolution of the
system's states and thereby significantly increasing the engine's output work,
efficiency, and power. Asymmetric heat engines, where the two isochoric strokes
have different Stark field strengths and stroke times, are more conducive to
optimizing the heat engine's performance. Additionally, in the DS model, an
increase in the number of atoms is also beneficial for increasing the heat
engine's output work and efficiency. The results of this paper facilitate the
design of high-performance quantum heat engines.

Result: 数值模拟显示在电路级噪声下性能稳健，噪声阈值>0.4%。

Conclusion: 三轮车码为高效魔法态蒸馏提供了可行方案，适用于中性原子阵列平台。

Abstract: The preparation of high-fidelity non-Clifford (magic) states is an essential
subroutine for universal quantum computation, but imposes substantial
space-time overhead. Magic state factories based on high rate and distance
quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codes equipped with transversal
non-Clifford gates can potentially reduce these overheads significantly, by
circumventing the need for multiple rounds of distillation and producing a
large number of magic states in a single code-block. As a step towards
realizing efficient, fault-tolerant magic state distillation, we introduce a
class of finite block-length quantum LDPC codes which we name tricycle codes,
generalizing the well-known bicycle codes to three homological dimensions.
These codes can support constant-depth physical circuits that implement logical
CCZ gates between three code blocks. We show that these tricycle codes enable
magic state generation with single-shot state-preparation and error correction,
leading to a deterministic low-overhead distillation protocol without requiring
post-selection. Numerical simulations of specific codes confirm robust
performance under circuit-level noise with a
Belief-Propagation+Order-Statistics Decoder (BPOSD), demonstrating a high
circuit-noise threshold of $>0.4\%$. Finally, we construct optimal depth
syndrome extraction circuits for tricycle codes and present a protocol for
implementing them efficiently on a reconfigurable neutral atom array platform.

Method: 针对局部去极化噪声，通过傅里叶分析方法，分析DQI在噪声下的性能表现，并以最大线性可满足性问题为例进行理论证明和数值模拟。

Result: 噪声环境下，DQI的性能与实例矩阵的噪声加权稀疏参数相关，解的质量随稀疏性降低呈指数衰减。

Conclusion: 本文提出的傅里叶分析方法可推广至其他随机泡利噪声，为在现实噪声中保持DQI的量子优势提供了指导。

Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) is a recently proposed quantum
optimization algorithm that exploits sparsity in the Fourier spectrum of
objective functions, with the potential for exponential speedups over classical
algorithms on suitably structured problems. While highly promising in idealized
settings, its resilience to noise has until now been largely unexplored. To
address this, we conduct a rigorous analysis of DQI under noise, focusing on
local depolarizing noise. For the maximum linear satisfiability problem, we
prove that, in the presence of noise, performance is governed by a
noise-weighted sparsity parameter of the instance matrix, with solution quality
decaying exponentially as sparsity decreases. We demonstrate this decay through
numerical simulations on two special cases: the Optimal Polynomial Intersection
problem and the Maximum XOR Satisfiability problem. The Fourier-analytic
methods we develop can be readily adapted to other classes of random Pauli
noise, making our framework applicable to a broad range of noisy quantum
settings and offering guidance on preserving DQI's potential quantum advantage
under realistic noise.

Abstract: By integrating tweezer arrays with a high-cooperativity ring cavity with

from a programmable number of atoms. Through accurate control of the
interatomic distance, we observe a narrowing-down of the Bragg peak as we
increase the atom number one by one. The observed high-contrast Bragg
interference is enabled by cavity sideband cooling of both the radial and axial

Conclusion: 为下一代超导量子处理器设计提供了原生多量子比特相互作用的核心技术基础。

Abstract: We present a native three-qubit entangling gate that exploits engineered
interactions to realize control-control-target and control-target-target
operations in a single coherent step. Unlike conventional decompositions into
multiple two-qubit gates, our hybrid optimization approach selectively
amplifies desired interactions while suppressing unwanted couplings, yielding
robust performance across the computational subspace and beyond. The new gate
can be classified as a cross-resonance gate. We show it can be utilized in
several ways, for example, in GHZ triplet state preparation, Toffoli-class
logic demonstrations with many-body interactions, and in implementing a
controlled-ZZ gate. The latter maps the parity of two data qubits directly onto
a measurement qubit, enabling faster and higher-fidelity stabilizer
measurements in surface-code quantum error correction. In all these examples,
we show that the three-qubit gate performance remains robust across Hilbert
space sizes, as confirmed by testing under increasing total excitation numbers.
This work lays the foundation for co-designing circuit architectures and
control protocols that leverage native multiqubit interactions as core elements
of next-generation superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Entanglement generation in polariton systems is fundamentally constrained by
high losses and decoherence, which typically outweigh polariton nonlinearities.
Here, we propose a conceptually different approach that uses optomechanical
interactions, rather than polariton-polariton interactions, to generate
entangled polaritons. Our double-resonant scheme relies on strong
exciton-phonon coupling, found in both inorganic and molecular semiconductors,
enabling room-temperature generation of spectrally disparate photon pairs. The
quantum coherent and delocalized nature of polariton states inside an optical
cavity ensures efficient single-mode outcoupling and allows for unconditional
quantum state preparation--not relying on any post-selection or projective
measurements. When conditioned on exciton-polariton emission, single
phonon-polariton states can be prepared that subsequently yield bright,
heralded single-photon emission in the mid-IR. We introduce a double-resonant
optomechanical platform that enables scalable, room-temperature quantum
polaritonics without relying on conventional excitonic nonlinearities.

Abstract: We propose a model of a scalable qudit-based quantum processor that uses
rotational degrees of freedom of polar molecules. Entangling gates between
qudits are implemented via moving molecule in optical traps by exploiting
dipole-dipole interactions to mediate coherent coupling. We develop encoding
schemes that map single qubits (d=2) into qudits of dimensions 2 <= d <= 5, and
pairs of qubits into higher-dimensional qudits with d=4, 5. This approach
enables the realization of a universal set of quantum gates. In particular, we
exploit additional levels that are present in the d=3 and d=5 qudits, which
allows one to simplify the decomposition of multiqubit gates. We then analyze
the relevant experimental parameters to realize our schemes with SrF and
87Rb133Cs molecules. The proposed approach offers a promising route towards
scalable and versatile quantum information processing with multilevel systems,
which can be potentially realized using currently available experimental
facilities.

Abstract: Ground State Energy Estimation (GSEE) is a central problem in quantum
chemistry and condensed matter physics, demanding efficient algorithms to solve
complex electronic structure calculations. This work introduces a structured
benchmarking framework for evaluating the performance of both classical and
quantum solvers on diverse GSEE problem instances. We assess three prominent
methods -- Semistochastic Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction (SHCI), Density
Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), and Double-Factorized Quantum Phase
Estimation (DF QPE) -- ighlighting their respective strengths and limitations.
Our results show that fully optimized SHCI achieves near-universal solvability
on the benchmark set, DMRG excels for low-entanglement systems, and DF QPE is
currently constrained by hardware and algorithmic limitations. However, we
observe that many benchmark Hamiltonians are drawn from datasets tailored to
SHCI and related approaches, introducing a bias that favors classical solvers.
To mitigate this, we propose expanding the benchmark suite to include more
challenging, strongly correlated systems to enable a more balanced and
forward-looking evaluation of solver capabilities. As quantum hardware and
algorithms improve, this benchmarking framework will serve as a vital tool for
tracking progress and identifying domains where quantum methods may surpass
classical techniques. The QB-GSEE benchmark repository is openly available at
https://github.com/isi-usc-edu/qb-gsee-benchmark [1]. By maintaining a scalable
and open resource, we aim to accelerate innovation in computational quantum
chemistry and quantum computing.

Conclusion: 畴壁的动力学行为在临界场附近表现出复杂的非线性特征，为理解铁磁体中的畴壁运动提供了新视角。

Abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of extended domain walls in homogeneous
ferromagnets driven by a uniform magnetic field at zero temperature. Using both
micromagnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and a collective-coordinate
model, we show that flat domain walls become linearly unstable above the Walker
breakdown field and below a higher threshold, provided their length exceeds a
characteristic value. This instability is captured by a quasi-universal
spectral diagram, parameterized solely by the Gilbert damping, that predicts
the onset of deviations from rigid-wall behavior. Beyond the linear regime,
large domain walls with bands of unstable modes exhibit spatiotemporal chaos,
intricate Bloch line motion, and deterministic roughening. The system undergoes
a dynamical phase transition from a flat to a rough moving phase at a critical
field.

Abstract: We investigate the formation, stability, and dynamics of solitons in a
one-dimensional binary Bose-Einstein condensate under the action of the
spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) correction to the underlying
system of the Gross-Pitaevskii equations. We identify the semi-dipole (SD)
family of solitons and thoroughly analyze its properties. The numerical
analysis reveals intricate bifurcations, including transitions from real to
complex-valued stationary wavefunctions of the SD solitons and norm-dependent
dynamical instabilities. Stability maps in the plane of the solitons' norm and
interaction strength exhibit areas of monostability, oscillatory behavior, and
soliton splitting. Solitons with complex stationary wavefunctions emerge as
ground states in broad parameter areas, due to the effects of the LHY terms.
The other soliton species, in the form of mixed modes (MMs), does not feature
the compexification bifurcation. In the LHY-dominated regime, the SD and MM
solitons exhibit identical values of the energy for the same norm. The results
deepen the understanding of nonlinear matter-wave states and reveal
multi-stable ones in quantum gases.

Abstract: Quantifying how spatial disorder affects the movement of a diffusing particle
or agent is fundamental to target search studies. When diffusion occurs on a
network, that is on a highly disordered environment, we lack the mathematical
tools to calculate exactly the temporal characteristics of search processes,
instead relying on estimates provided by stochastic simulations. To close this
knowledge gap we devise a general methodology to represent analytically the
movement and search dynamics of a diffusing random walk on sparse graphs. We
show its utility by uncovering the existence of a bi-modality regime in the
time-dependence of the first-passage probability to hit a target node in a
small-world network. By identifying the network features that give rise to the
bi-modal regime, we challenge long-held beliefs on how the statistics of the
so-called direct, intermediate, and indirect trajectories influence the shape
of the resulting first-passage and first-absorption probabilities and the
interpretation of their mean values. Overall these findings show that temporal
features in first-passage studies can be utilised to unearth novel transport
paradigms in spatially heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of active particles undergoing a
three-state run-and-tumble dynamics in one dimension, induced by non-reciprocal
transition rates between self-propelling velocity states $\{-v, 0, +v\}$ that
explicitly break microscopic reversibility. Departing from conventional
reciprocal models, our formulation introduces a minimal yet rich framework for
studying non-equilibrium transport driven by internal state asymmetries. Using
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and analytical methods, we characterize the
particle's transport properties across the transition-rates space. The model
exhibits a variety of non-equilibrium behaviors, including ballistic transport,
giant diffusion, and Gaussian or non-Gaussian transients, depending on the
degree of asymmetry in the transition rates. We identify a manifold in
transition-rate space where long-time diffusive behavior emerges despite the
absence of microscopic reversibility. Exact expressions are obtained for the
drift, effective diffusion coefficient, and moments of the position
distribution. Our results establish how internal-state irreversibility governs
macroscopic transport, providing a tractable framework to study non-equilibrium
active motion beyond reciprocal dynamics.

Abstract: We present FreeBird.jl, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational
studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range
of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained
lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic
potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems
accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface
and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested
sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable
lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and
multiple dispatch, FreeBird.jl provides a modular interface that allows
seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling
schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird.jl
offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial
phenomena.

Result: 发现彩色沙堆模型的稳态和雪崩尺寸分布与普通模型不同，属于不同的普适类。

Conclusion: 该模型可用于描述具有不同颜色和性质的颗粒堆的动态行为。

Abstract: After the introduction of sandpile model a number of different variants have
been studied. In most of
  these models sand particles are indistinguishable. Here we have painted the
sand particles using a
  few distinct colors, and restrict them to move in linear trajectories only
along their assigned lattice axes,
  one axis reserved for one color. Different colored particles interact among
themselves through the
  toppling of unstable sand columns. Consequently, the avalanches or in general
the self-organization
  processes in the sandpile has no overall preferred direction, though the
individual particles
  execute directed motion. For such non-abelian colored sandpiles the steady
states are found to be
  different and also the avalanche size distributions. This sandpile so defined
has a non-trivial spatial
  structure and belongs to a different universality class of sandpile models.
Dynamics of a granular heap
  with grains of different colors and properties may be described using this
sandpile.

Motivation: 改进现有张量重整化群（TRG）方法，以更高的精度处理二维张量网络，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 利用变分边界张量作为全局优化环境，构建重整化投影器，结合张量的规范形式。

Result: 算法在保持TRG计算复杂度的同时，精度高于未引入纠缠过滤的现有方法。

Conclusion: 为将TRG方法扩展到更高维度提供了实用路径，同时控制计算成本。

Abstract: We propose a real-space renormalization group algorithm for accurately
coarse-graining two-dimensional tensor networks. The central innovation of our
method lies in utilizing variational boundary tensors as a globally optimized
environment for the entire system. Based on this optimized environment, we
construct renormalization projectors that significantly enhance accuracy. By
leveraging the canonical form of tensors, our algorithm maintains the same
computational complexity as the original tensor renormalization group (TRG)
method, yet achieves higher accuracy than existing approaches that do not
incorporate entanglement filtering. Our work offers a practical pathway for
extending TRG methods to higher dimensions while keeping computational costs
manageable.

effect (which takes place if the geometry has broken spatial symmetry), and the
enhanced diffusion coefficient. We study those particles using numerical
simulations employing an ASEP-like model. Besides direct numerical simulations
we study the model by mean-field approximation and by solving the
coarse-grained hydrodynamic equations.

Motivation: 探索DFS路径在统计物理模型中的分形特性，以提供一种新的几何探针来研究临界现象。

Method: 分析二维O(n)环模型和键渗流（d=2到6）中DFS路径的分形维数，并与外部边界进行比较。

Result: 在O(n)环模型中，DFS路径的分形维数与外部边界一致；在键渗流中，DFS路径在所有维度均表现出分形行为。

Conclusion: DFS是一种稳健且广泛适用的几何探针，可用于研究传统观测之外的临界现象。

Abstract: We study the fractal properties of depth-first search (DFS) paths in critical
configurations of statistical physics models, including the two-dimensional
$O(n)$ loop model for various $n$, and bond percolation in dimensions $d = 2$
to $6$. In the $O(n)$ loop model, the fractal dimension of the DFS path
consistently matches that of the external perimeter, suggesting DFS as a
convenient alternative for probing interface geometry. For bond percolation,
the DFS path exhibits nontrivial fractal scaling across all studied dimensions,
even in $d > 2$ where the external perimeter is not well defined.
Interestingly, when DFS is applied to the full lattice without any dilution or
criticality, the path is still fractal in two dimensions, with a dimension
close to $7/4$, but becomes space-filling in higher dimensions. Our results
demonstrate that DFS offers a robust and broadly applicable geometric probe for
exploring critical phenomena beyond traditional observables.

Conclusion: 该方法与Koopman算子方法直接相关，并成功应用于非线性非平衡的相互作用兴奋和抑制群体的平均场描述。

Abstract: The derivation of dynamical laws for general observables (or moments) from
the master equation for the probability distribution remains a challenging
problem in statistical physics. Here, we present an alternative formulation of
the general spectral expansion, which clarifies the connection between the
relaxation dynamics of arbitrary moments and the intrinsic time scales of the
system. Within this framework, we address the moment-closure problem in a way
that streamline the conventional treatment of open systems. The effectiveness
of the theory is illustrated by deriving analytical expressions for two
representative cases: spectral amplification in stochastic resonance and the
moment dynamics of a non-Gaussian system, namely the Bessel process with
constant drift. We also identify a direct relationship between our theory and
the Koopman operator approach. Finally, we apply our approach to the nonlinear
and out-of-equilibrium mean-field description of interacting excitatory and
inhibitory populations.

Motivation: 研究随机置换电路在量子环境下的混沌行为，探索其作为经典和量子混沌模型的潜力。

Method: 通过分析局部算子纠缠（LOE）的时间演化，研究不同局部配置空间维度（q）下随机置换电路的混沌特性。

Result: 当q=2时，LOE有界，表明非混沌；q>2时，LOE线性增长，证明量子混沌性。数值模拟支持q=3时LOE线性增长。

Conclusion: 随机置换电路可通过经典动力学产生量子混沌，LOE可作为经典和量子混沌的通用指标。

Abstract: Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for
local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum.
Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems
exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we
address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local
operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random
permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space
q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are
Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating
that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the
local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove
this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a
three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth
of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by
essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also
in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both
quantum and classical.

Conclusion: 扭曲SnSe2因其高可调性成为实现多种关联量子相的理想平台。

Abstract: We construct an interacting Wannier model for both AA-stacked and AB-stacked
twisted SnSe2, revealing a rich landscape of correlated quantum phases. For the
AA-stacked case, the system is effectively described by a three-orbital
triangular lattice model, where each orbital corresponds to a valley and
exhibits an approximate one-dimensional hopping structure due to a new
momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetry. By exploring the interacting phase
diagram using a combination of theoretical methods, including Hartree-Fock
mean-field theory and exact solutions of the spin model in certain limits, we
identify several exotic quantum phases. These include a dimerized phase with
finite residual entropy, valence bond solids, and quantum paramagnetism. In the
AB-stacked case, the system realizes an interacting kagome lattice model, where
the Wannier orbitals associated with the three valleys form three sublattices.
In the strong coupling regime, we use cluster mean-field methods to demonstrate
the emergence of a classical spin liquid phase due to the frustrated lattice
structure. The high tunability of the moir\'e system, which allows control over
both the filling and interaction strength (via twist angle), renders twisted
SnSe2 a versatile platform for realizing a wide range of exotic correlated
quantum phases.

Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful local probe of correlated
electronic states. Here we present a group theoretical framework for the
analysis of STM data, filtering STM images into components which provide a real
space mapping of the local symmetry properties of the underlying density of
states. Using this formalism, we show that certain kinds of symmetry breaking
are impossible to resolve in the first Brillouin zone, due to symmetry
restrictions we term ``Bragg peak extinctions'' in analogy with related ideas
in x-ray crystallography. We show extinct patterns of symmetry breaking can be
resolved using sub-unit cell structure, and develop methodological details for
the accurate extraction of this symmetry information. We illustrate our results
on synthetic STM data for $2\times 2$ charge density waves on the kagome
lattice, and on topographic data for kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Our results
provide a powerful method for extracting symmetry insights from STM data, and
provide constraints on when and how certain ground states are experimentally
observable.

Result: 发现四通道Kondo固定点下自旋激发存在分数化现象，但XY型各向异性会导致其不稳定。

Conclusion: 四通道Kondo效应的现象学可能因XY各向异性而难以检测，实验需谨慎控制。

Abstract: We study the boundary phase diagram and the low-temperature heat and
magnetization transport at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains.
  Depending on the magnetization axis anisotropy between the magnetic exchange
interactions at the junction, the system exhibits two different strong-coupling
regimes at low energies/temperatures, similar to the overscreened (topological)
four- and to the two-channel Kondo fixed points. Using renormalization group
arguments combined with boundary conformal field theory methods, we show the
instability of the former under any XY-type anisotropy at the junction. We
analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of
spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo
fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law. We caution that the
instability under XY anisotropy may hinder the detection of the phenomenology
related to the four-channel Kondo effect, therefore requiring careful control
in experimental realizations.

Method: 采用MBE技术生长Mn-Bi-Te薄膜，通过光谱椭偏仪和红外透射光谱分析，结合有效介质模型研究薄膜结构。

Result: 缺陷相关的光学响应随Mn含量增加而向高能方向移动，电子局域化增强，薄膜结构呈现非连续性和量子反点特征。

Conclusion: 非化学计量Mn-Bi-Te薄膜的结构非连续性和电子局域化效应显著，支持了局域化效应的相关性。

Abstract: The intrinsic substitutional and antisite defects cause unintentional doping
and shift of the E_F position above the conduction band minimum in the AFM
topological insulator (TI) MnBi2Te4. This prevents measurements of the quantum
anomalous Hall effect (QAH) and investigation of the topological Dirac states.
In the present study, the Mn-Bi-Te films grown by the MBE technique onto
Si(111) substrates with decreasing Bi and Te contents and increasing Mn content
were investigated by 0.5-6.5 eV spectroscopic ellipsometry. In addition, the
0.004-0.9 eV infrared (IR) transmittance spectra were examined. An effective
medium model was used to reproduce the measured ellipsometric angles,
Psi(omega) and Delta(omega), of the Mn-Bi-Te films in terms of the constructed
model, including film thickness, surface roughness, and volume fractions of two
(MnTe and Bi2Te3) or three constituents, the latter being associated with the
structural inhomogeneities contribution. The results obtained for the
inhomogeneous Mn-Bi-Te films using the three-phase EMA model indicate that the
defect-associated optical response systematically shifts to higher photon
energies from ~1.95 to ~2.43 eV with decreasing Te and Bi contents and
increasing Mn content, pointing out that the electrons become more deeply
localized in the formed structural inhomogeneities. The obtained results
indicate that the structure of the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films is not
continuous but represented by regions of nearly stoichiometric MnBi2Te4 phase,
which includes hollows or quantum anti-dots (QADs). The measured FIR
transmittance spectra for the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films show
substantially reduced (or absent) contribution(s) from free charge carriers,
which supports the relevance of localization effects.

Abstract: The rare earth intermetallic system \textit{R}Al\textit{X} (\textit{R} = rare
earth elements, \textit{X} = Si and Ge) is known to be a promising candidate of
magnetic Weyl semimetal. Due to the complex interactions between the rare earth
elements and surrounding atoms, as well as hybridization with itinerant
electrons, this family likely possesses highly intriguing and novel magnetic
structures and thus exhibits dynamic behaviors. We systematically probe
polycrystalline samples of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = La, Ce, Pr and Nd)
combining inelastic neutron scattering (INS), heat capacity and magnetic
susceptibility measurements. The INS measurements identify well-resolved
crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations at 19.2 and 24.9 meV in CeAlSi, at
5.4 meV in PrAlSi, and at 2.5 and 4.2 meV in NdAlSi. We analyzed the INS data
using the corresponding CEF models and determined the CEF parameters and ground
state wave functions of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd). Our
results suggest strong single-ion anisotropy in their ground states:
$|\pm3/2\rangle$ (94.5\%) in CeAlSi, $|\pm3\rangle$ (99.2\%) in PrAlSi, and
$|\pm9/2\rangle$ (76.2\%) in NdAlSi. Notably, the weaker anisotropy and strong
exchange interactions in NdAlSi promote competing magnetic orders and CEF
splitting at low temperature, contrasting with the robust CEF levels in
magnetic states of CeAlSi and PrAlSi.

Ba$_3$Zn$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ru$_2$O$_9$ using analytical theory, density functional
theory, inelastic neutron scattering, and modeling of historical magnetization
and neutron-scattering data. A dimer mean-field theory built upon classical
Luttinger-Tisza analysis generates a phase diagram revealing a transition from
a nonmagnetic singlet to a finite-moment ground state as interdimer couplings
increase. A (generalized) linear spin-wave theory captures multiplet mixing,
excitation gap closing, and fluctuation-induced moment suppression. Density
functional theory on select compounds and neutron spectroscopy on dilute
Ba$_3$Zn(Ru$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$O$_9$ confirm the exchange hierarchy, enabling
quantification of previously published experiments within this framework. Our
results identify three mechanisms for magnetic moment suppression: quantum
fluctuations, ligand hybridization, and nonmagnetic-singlet/magnetic-multiplet
mixing.

Result: 提出的QKM避免了指数集中，且在真实数据上表现出有效学习能力。

Conclusion: 该QKM可在现有中性原子量子计算机上实现，解决了传统QKM的指数集中问题。

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods (QKMs) offer an appealing framework for machine
learning on near-term quantum computers. However, QKMs generically suffer from
exponential concentration, requiring an exponential number of measurements to
resolve the kernel values, with the exception of trivial (i.e., classically
simulable) kernels. Here we propose a QKM that is free of exponential
concentration, yet remains hard to simulate classically. Our QKM utilizes the
weak ergodicity-breaking many-body dynamics in the Rydberg blockade of
coherently driven neutral atom arrays. We demonstrate the fundamental
properties of our QKM by analytically solving an approximate toy model of its
underpinning quantum dynamics, as well as by extensive numerical simulations on
randomly generated datasets. We further show that the proposed kernel exhibits
effective learning on real data. The proposed QKM can be implemented in current
neutral atom quantum computers.

Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) constitute a powerful variational
ansatz for capturing ground state physics of two-dimensional quantum systems.
However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value
remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom
that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We
analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS
with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a
single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the
gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly
inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore,
we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this
effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need
for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational
PEPS in general settings.

dimensional constraints, we show that the orbital Berry curvature, which
governs the orbital Hall effect, can be universally expressed as the product of
the band energy and the square of the Berry curvature. This highlights the
central role of Berry curvature in engineering orbital Hall responses. We also
discuss the applicability of our framework by analyzing a realistic model. Our
findings underscore the geometric universality of itinerant intrinsic orbital
dynamics.

Abstract: The coupling between real-space coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an
alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond
the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an
unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in
two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where
the spin-split floating edge states - energetically isolated within the bulk
band gap - emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically
tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to
be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance,
giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR)
effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we
computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr2Se2O monolayer to
demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the Neel order or
electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device
for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.

Abstract: The dynamic control of skyrmion properties such as polarity, vorticity, and
topological charge is crucial for their implementation in spintronic
applications. In this work, we investigate the periodic inversion of the
topological charge in two distinct systems: FeGe, a bulk chiral magnet, and
Co/Pt, an interfacial system with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. By
applying an oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane, we
induce cyclic transitions in the spin texture. In FeGe, the skyrmion evolves
through a $Q=1 \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow -1$ sequence via an intermediate
skyrmionium state. In Co/Pt, the process involves skyrmion annihilation and
re-nucleation, resulting in alternating topological charges. These results
reveal distinct dynamic mechanisms for topological charge modulation, offering
potential pathways for the energy-efficient control of skyrmion-based devices.

Conclusion: 揭示了自旋极化边缘态的微观机制，可能破坏时间反演对称性对拓扑边缘态的保护。

Abstract: We study interaction-driven edge reconstruction in a quantum spin Hall
insulator described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with Kanamori-Hubbard
interactions using the real-space density matrix renormalization group method
in both the grand-canonical and canonical ensembles. For a two-dimensional
cylinder with a smooth edge, we identify discrete particle-number transitions
that lead to a spin-polarized edge state stabilized by an emergent
ferromagnetic exchange interaction. The reconstruction is orbital-selective,
occurring predominantly in the $s$-orbital channel. Our results reveal a fully
microscopic mechanism for emergent spin polarization at the edge that could
compromise the topological protection of helical edge states by time reversal
symmetry.

Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic, field-free magnetization reversal of a
single-domain nanomagnet within 300 ps under a current density of $3 \times
10^{10}~\mathrm{A/m^2}$ by coupling reinforcement learning (RL) to the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the spin-orbit torques (SOTs). The RL
agent autonomously discovers a current waveform that minimizes the
magnetization trajectory path and exploits a precessional shortcut enabled by
the field-like SOT and hard-axis anisotropy. From the learned pulse, we extract
a clear physical picture of the dynamics and develop a model-based analytical
framework that establishes a lower bound on the switching time. The control
strategy remains robust across a wide range of damping constants and is
stabilized against thermal fluctuations at higher current densities. We also
discuss feasible experimental implementations for the precessional switching.

Abstract: Over the past decade, graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for
exploring the viscous nature of electronic flow facilitated by the availability
of extremely high-quality devices employing a graphene channel encapsulated
within dielectric layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, the level
of disorder in such systems is mainly determined by the device fabrication
protocols, making it impossible to obtain a tunability between the
impurity-dominated and the viscous transport within the same device. In this
work, using a combination of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and gate electric
field, we have demonstrated a dynamic modulation of charge hydrodynamics,
quantified in the thermal and electrical transport by the extent of departure
from the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) Law in monolayer graphene devices at room
temperature. We achieved this by tuning the disorder level continuously and
reversibly using UV light to create transient trap states in the encapsulating
hBN dielectric. With progressive UV radiation, we observed a dramatic increase
in the momentum-relaxing scattering relative to that between the electrons and
also the Lorentz number, by nearly a factor of ten, with increasing disorder,
thereby approaching the restoration of the WF law in highly disordered
graphene. Our experiments outline a potent strategy to tune the fundamental
mechanism of charge flow in state-of-the-art graphene devices.

Abstract: In moir\'e-patterned van der Waals structures of transition metal
dichalcogenides, correlated insulators can form under integer and fractional
fillings, whose transport properties are governed by various quasiparticle
excitations including holons, doublons and interlayer exciton insulators. Here
we theoretically investigate the nearest-neighbor inter-site hoppings of holons
and interlayer exciton insulators. Our analysis indicates that these hopping
strengths are significantly enhanced compared to that of a single carrier. The
underlying mechanism can be attributed to the strong Coulomb interaction
between carriers at different sites. For the interlayer exciton insulator
consisting of a holon and a carrier in different layers, we have also obtained
its effective Bohr radius and energy splitting between the ground and
first-excited states.

Abstract: Flat bands, in which kinetic energy is quenched and quantum states become
macroscopically degenerate, host a rich variety of correlated and topological
phases, from unconventional superconductors to fractional Chern insulators. In
Hermitian lattices, their formation mechanisms are now well understood, but
whether such states persist, and acquire new features in non-Hermitian (NH)
quantum crystals, relevant to open and driven systems, has remained an open
question. Here we show that the Hermitian principle for flat-band formation in
bipartite lattices, based on a sublattice degeneracy mismatch, extends directly
to the NH regime: whenever one sublattice hosts a momentum-independent
eigenvalue with degeneracy exceeding that of its partner on the other
sublattice, flat bands arise regardless of gain, loss, or complex couplings.
Strikingly, at exceptional points, dispersive bands coalesce to form
\emph{exceptional flat bands} that persist beyond these singularities,
exhibiting biorthogonal eigenmodes spanning both sublattices, with energies and
lifetimes tunable via sublattice asymmetry and non-reciprocal couplings. This
general framework unifies Hermitian and NH flat-band constructions, and reveals
dispersionless states with no closed-system analogue. The proposed construction
is applicable to synthetic platforms, from classical metamaterials, where flat
bands can be directly emulated, to quantum-engineered systems such as photonic
crystals and ultracold atom arrays, which should host correlated and
topological phases emerging from such exceptional flat bands.
