Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and\nunresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed\nsimply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet\ncrucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and\ncorrelation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework\nthat approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key\nobservation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing\nenergy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish\nintegrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte\nCarlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert\nspace and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain\nmixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical\ncharacter of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which\nsharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure\napplies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their\nstructure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space.\nAs a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from\nthe permutation group $\\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and\ngenerality."}

Correspondingly, an appreciable reduction\nin the magnetization below $T$=100 K further suggests partial Kondo screening\nof local moments active at low temperatures, explaining its effective spin\nmagnetization state and upturn in its resistivity observed in experimental\nreports. We note a significant effect of Hund's induced spin-orbital selective\nincoherence in dictating the temperature evolution of its macroscopic\nobservables e.g. spin-spin correlation function and effective local moment. Our\nresults reveal a potentially distinct/new form of spin-dependent selectivity\ninduced via Hund's coupling in addition to the conventional orbital-selectivity\nin the Hund's metals, as a plausible key mechanism in stabilizing their\nlong-range magnetic order."}

We present an extensive set of simulations comprising a total of $11$\ndifferent operator pools, which all systematically and independently break or\npreserve a combination of discrete translations, the conservation of charge\n(magnetization) and the fermionic locality of the excitations.

In this work, we consider a\nvariant called cheat-penalised weak coin-flipping in which if a party gets\ncaught cheating, they lose $\\Lambda$ points (compared to $0$ in the standard\ndefinition). We find that already for a small cheating penalty, the landscape\nof coin-flipping changes dramatically. For example, with $\\Lambda=0.01$, we\nexhibit a protocol where neither Alice nor Bob can bias the result in their\nfavour beyond $1/2 + 10^{-8}$, which uses $24$ qubits and $10^{16}$ rounds of\ncommunication (provably $10^{7}$ times better than any weak coin-flipping\nprotocol with matching security). For the same space requirements, we\ndemonstrate how one can choose between lowering how much a malicious party can\nbias the result (down to $1/2 + 10^{-10}$) and reducing the rounds of\ncommunication (down to $25,180$), depending on what is preferred. To find these\nprotocols, we make two technical contributions. First, we extend the point\ngame-protocol correspondence introduced by Kitaev and Mochon, to incorporate:\n(i) approximate point games, (ii) the cheat-penalised setting, and (iii) round\nand space complexity. Second, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge)\nnumerical algorithm for constructing (approximate) point games that correspond\nto high security and low complexity.

We show that the absence of\nthis objectivity has a quantum advantage in cryptography and also provides the\ncrucial missing link in efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits with\nzero discord. For this purpose, we consider a model of mixed state quantum\ncomputation where one is promised concordant states at all stages of the\nquantum circuit. A concordant quantum state has zero discord with respect to\nany part and there exists a basis made up of a tensor product of orthonormal\nlocal subsystem basis in which the density matrix is diagonal. Efficient\nclassical simulation of concordant computation has surprisingly been an\noutstanding question in quantum information theory. We argue that a key\ningredient of an efficient classical simulation algorithm, a knowledge of the\nlocal basis in which the multi-party state is diagonal, is made available by\nquantum Darwinism. Concordant states in the absence of quantum Darwinism cannot\nbe efficiently simulated by existing methods and give a cryptographic advantage\nin communication. We show this by giving a protocol for secure quantum\ncommunication that exploits this insight. Our work also has implications for\nthe quantum-classical border and we discuss how objectivity emerging out of\nDarwinism demarcates this border in three ways - empirical based on our\nobservations and experience of objectivity, information theoretic due to the\nabsence of any quantum correlations and lastly computational in the sense\ndiscussed above. Lastly, we show that the quantum-classical boundary as drawn\nby quantum Darwinism as well by what can be simulated efficiently in a mixed\nstate quantum computation aligns with the boundary given by Hardy"}

While multiple statistically\nsecure blind verification schemes in the prepare-and-send model have been\nproposed, none of them achieves full quantum fault-tolerance, a prerequisite\nfor useful verification on scalable quantum computers. In this paper, we\npresent the first fault-tolerant blind verification scheme for universal\nquantum computations able to handle secret-dependent noise on the verifier's\nquantum device. Composable security of the proposed protocol is proven in the\nAbstract Cryptography framework.\n  Our main tools are two novel distillation protocols that turn\nsecret-dependent noise into secret-independent noise. The first one is run by\nthe verifier and acts on its noisy gates, while the second and more complex one\nis run entirely on the prover's device and acts on states provided by the\nverifier.

Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and\nunresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed\nsimply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet\ncrucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and\ncorrelation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework\nthat approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key\nobservation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing\nenergy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish\nintegrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte\nCarlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert\nspace and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain\nmixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical\ncharacter of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which\nsharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure\napplies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their\nstructure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space.\nAs a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from\nthe permutation group $\\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and\ngenerality."}
