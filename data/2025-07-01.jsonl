To address this question, we\ndemonstrate that when the on-site repulsion strength ($U$) is set to zero on a\npercentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to\npercolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures.

Most fundamental among these are the\nso-called \"parton\" quantum numbers, which give rise to a zoo of composite\nsectors. In this note, we propose a categorical description of partons. Along\nthe way, we make contact with ideas from generalized symmetries and SymTFT."}

Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation\neffects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may\nimpact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material\nwith both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of\noptical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we\nobserve significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature,\narising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic\nordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass\nenhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \\textit{increases} and reaches\n$\\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection.\nRemarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin\nnanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus,\nCeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility\nheavy quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts."}

However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect\ninteraction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this\nwork, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction\nprojected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs.\nSpecifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the\ntwo-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between\nthe two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation\nallows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the\ntwo-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological\neffective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily\nbased on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact\nthat the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the\nrealization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\\nu = 1/3$. This result is\nconsistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the\nfractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From\nanother perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the\ninteraction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in\nthe context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body\ninteractions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs."}

This, in particular,\nallows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading\nRuelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the\nexponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the\nexistence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance,\nwhich governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic\ntails.
