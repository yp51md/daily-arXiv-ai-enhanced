The actual value of the crossover depends of the\nratio between the local stresses and the shear modulus. This excess DOS leads\nto a low-temperature specific heat with an apparent temperature exponent, which\nis between one and two, as observed experimentally. We discuss, how these\nfindings may be utilized for the characterisation of glassy materials.

Here, we present a general\ntimescale separation approach that is valid for any set of stochastic\ndifferential equations coupled across multiple timescales. We show two\nalternative derivations, one based on an iterative procedure, and the other\ngrounded on an a priori expansion in relevant small parameters associated with\nfaster timescales. We provide an explicit expression for the conditional\nstructure of the joint probability distribution of the whole set of processes\nthat is solely determined by the multiscale interactions. This result has\nimportant consequences in determining how information is generated in the\nsystem and how it propagates across different timescales. To demonstrate that\nour findings are valid independently of the specific dynamical model, we test\nthem against four different (linear and non-linear) dynamics. Then, we focus on\nthe scenario in which two degrees of freedom are reciprocally coupled across\ntheir timescales. In this case, we show that the statistics of the fastest\ndynamics is captured by an effective self-interaction term in the slowest one,\ncreating a regulatory loop. Finally, a connection with analogous previous\nresults obtained for discrete-state systems with higher-order interactions is\ndrawn, elucidating similarities and differences in the physical interpretation\nof the system. The presented framework might open the avenue for a clearer\nunderstanding of the interplay between the underlying multiscale structure and\nemergent functional behavior of biological and artificial systems."}

This\nspin-exchange induced PMM spillover effect provides a spectroscopic protocol\nfor determining the quantum statistics of $S$ through the emergent multi-level\nstructure in the proximal QD's density of states.

This system, referred to\nas $p$-wave anyons, interpolates continuously between spin-polarized fermions\nwith $p$-wave interactions and free bosons. At zero temperature, the\ncorrelation functions decay exponentially with distance, with oscillations\ngoverned by the statistics parameter. The decay rate is maximal for $p$-wave\nfermions and decreases monotonically as the statistics parameter approaches the\nbosonic limit, where it vanishes. The momentum distribution is asymmetric, a\nhallmark of one-dimensional anyons, and takes the form of a shifted Lorentzian\nwith universal power-law tails, $\\lim_{k \\to \\pm \\infty} n(k)\\sim C/k^2$. We\nprove analytically that, following release from a harmonic trap, the asymptotic\nmomentum distribution converges to that of free bosons in the same trap, a\nphenomenon known as dynamical bosonization. We also establish the universality\nof the groundstate $n$-particle reduced density matrices: their natural\noccupations are independent of the confining potential, while the associated\nnatural $n$-functions for different confinements are related through a simple\nanalytical transformation. In particular, for the one-particle reduced density\nmatrix, we derive exact expressions for both the natural occupations and the\nnatural orbitals at arbitrary particle number. These results extend and unify\nearlier partial findings for $p$-wave fermions, and they provide a clear\nconceptual explanation of the double degeneracy observed in their spectrum."}

First, the continuous growth in qubit counts has rendered\ndistributed QCA inevitable, yet the nondeterministic latencies inherent in\nfeedback loops demand cycleaccurate synchronization across multiple\ncontrollers. Existing synchronization strategies -- whether lock-step or\ndemand-driven -- introduce significant performance penalties. Second, existing\nquantum instruction set architectures are polarized, being either too abstract\nor too granular. This lack of a unifying design necessitates recurrent hardware\ncustomization for each new control requirement, which limits the system's\nreconfigurability and impedes the path toward a scalable and unified digital\nmicroarchitecture.\n  Addressing these challenges, we propose Distributed-HISQ, featuring: (i)\nHISQ, A universal instruction set that redefines quantum control with a\nhardware-agnostic design. By decoupling from quantum operation semantics, HISQ\nprovides a unified language for control sequences, enabling a single\nmicroarchitecture to support various control methods and enhancing system\nreconfigurability.

Additionally, we integrate a novel\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning network to guide molecular generation with\ndesired targeted properties, optimising key metrics such as quantitative\nestimate of drug-likeness (QED), octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP) and\nsynthetic accessibility (SA) scores in conjunction with one another.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the property\nalignment of generated molecules with the multi-agent reinforcement learning\nagents effectively balancing chemical properties."}
