We show that for any single-mode bosonic code\n(qumode) corrupted by thermal~noise at rate~$\\eta$ and mean\n\\mbox{excitation}~$\\bar{n}$, a hybrid continuous-discrete-variable~(CV-DV)\ninterferometer using only a single qubit ancilla~(DV) and two\ncontrolled~Fourier~(CF) gates sandwiching the noise channel suppresses its\neffects to $\\mathcal{O}(\\eta^2)$ \\emph{without} any active error correction or\ndestructive measurements of the encoded state and with high success\nprobabilities~$>0.5$ if~$\\eta(1+\\bar{n})<0.5$. This suppression scheme works by\nconditionally monitoring the photon-number parities after the interferometer.\nBosonic codes with two logical states of the same photon-number parity\n(like-parity codes) are \\emph{completely resilient} to DV amplitude- and\nphase-damping ancilla noise. For such codes, the interferometer simplifies to\nthe use of a qumode rotation gate and a \\emph{single} CF~gate. This presents a\nclear advantage of our CF-gate-based error suppression scheme over\npreviously-proposed ``bypass'' protocols, where qubit information transferred\nto the DV mode is readily corrupted by damping~noise. Finally, we present a\nsimple extension to direct communication of qumode states between two parties\nover a noisy channel using a preshared DV entangled state, by implementing a CF\ngate in the first laboratory and its inverse in the other. Such a communication\nprotocol achieves a similar fidelity performance at the same success rate as\nthe single-party case, but with greater resilience to the ancilla noise than\nDV~teleportation. Resource-efficient multi-qubit codes that depend on a few\nessential long-range interactions can benefit from it."}

Prevailing approaches either simulate the\nstochastic differential equations governing the forward dynamics of underlying\nasset prices or directly solve the backward pricing partial differential\nequation.

However, the limited size\nof current computers restricts the exploitation of the full potential of\nquantum machine learning methods. Additionally, different computing paradigms,\nboth quantum and classical, each have their own strengths and weaknesses.\nObtaining optimal results with algorithms thus requires algorithms to be\ntweaked to the underlying computational paradigm, and the tasks to be optimally\ndistributed over the available computational resources. In this work, we\nexplore the potential gains from combining different computing paradigms to\nsolve the complex task of data classification for three different datasets. We\nuse a gate-based quantum model to implement a quantum kernel and implement a\ncomplex feature map. Next, we formulate a quadratic unconstrained optimisation\nproblem to be solved on quantum annealing hardware. We then evaluate the losses\non classical hardware and reconfigure the model parameters accordingly. We\ntested this so-called triple-hybrid quantum support vector machine on various\ndata sets, and find that it achieves higher precision than other support vector\nmachines (both quantum and classical) on complex quantum data, whereas it\nachieves varying performance on simple classical data using limited training.\nFor the complex data sets, the triple-hybrid version converges faster,\nrequiring fewer circuit evaluations."}

Using elementary circuit-transformation techniques,\nwe show that such circuits can be exactly rewritten as classical probabilistic\ncircuits that reproduce measurement statistics. This rewriting introduces no\ncomputational overhead, in contrast to the general case of stabilizer circuits.\nTo clarify the origin of this simplification, we introduce the standard\nquadratic-form representation of general stabilizer operations (Clifford\nchannels).

For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal\nsingle-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and\nenergy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions\ncan be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations\nto shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon."}

To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon\npair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet\nexciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a\nfunction of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is\nintrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as\nself-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape\nanisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a\npossibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine\ninteraction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and\nelectron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate\nlimit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum\ndots."}
