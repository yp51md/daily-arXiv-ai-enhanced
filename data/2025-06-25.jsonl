To ensure a comprehensive\nanalysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on\nthe widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum\nstructure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the\nsymmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a\nmagnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of {the eigenvalues of\nthe unitary}, hence modifying {the mean recurrence time and the widening of the\ntransitions}, and this effect is studied in detail.

Here, we present an all-optical method to quantify\n$\\mathrm{V_B^-}$ defect density in hBN by correlating Raman and\nphotoluminescence (PL) signatures with irradiation fluence. We identify two\ndefect-induced Raman modes, D1 and D2, and assign them to vibrational modes of\n$\\mathrm{V_B^-}$ using polarization-resolved Raman measurements and density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations. By adapting a numerical model originally\ndeveloped for graphene, we establish an empirical relationship linking Raman\n(D1, $E_\\mathrm{2g}$) and PL intensities to absolute defect densities. This\nmethod is universally applicable across various irradiation types and uniquely\nsuited for thin flakes, where conventional techniques fail. Our approach\nenables accurate, direct, and non-destructive quantification of spin defect\ndensities down to $10^{15}$ defects/ cm${}^3$, offering a powerful tool for\noptimizing and benchmarking hBN for quantum optical applications."}

By virtue of Schmidt\ndecomposition and mutually unbiased bases, here we propose a universal protocol\nto verify arbitrary multipartite pure quantum states using adaptive local\nprojective measurements. Moreover, we establish a universal upper bound on the\nsample complexity that is independent of the local dimensions. Numerical\ncalculations further indicate that Haar-random pure states can be verified with\na constant sample cost, irrespective of the qudit number and local dimensions,\neven in the adversarial scenario in which the source cannot be trusted. As\nalternatives, we provide multiple simpler variants that can achieve similar\nhigh efficiencies."}

In this work, we identify necessary and sufficient\nconditions under which the dynamics of these different descriptions retain the\nweak symmetry of the quantum master equation and we characterise the resulting\nsymmetries of the different descriptions in terms of their generators. We find\nthat the joint dynamics always features a separable symmetry directly related\nto that of the quantum master equation, but for quantum trajectories the\ncorresponding symmetry is present only if the counting measurement satisfies\ncertain conditions."}

However, the extremely low energy of microwave photons (~{\\mu}eV)\npresents a fundamental challenge, preventing direct photon-to-charge conversion\nas achieved in optical systems using semiconductors. Semiconductor quantum dot\n(QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable\nenergy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single\nphotons. In this work, we demonstrate microwave photon detection with an\nefficiency approaching 70% in the single-photon regime. We use a hybrid system\ncomprising a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit electrostatically defined in\na GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, coupled to a high-impedance Josephson junction\n(JJ) array cavity. We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to\nmaximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon\ncoupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons\ncoherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable\nelectrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion.\nMoreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition\nenergy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system\nefficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz. Our results establish semiconductor-based\ncavity-QED architectures as a scalable and versatile platform for efficient\nmicrowave photon detection, opening new avenues for quantum microwave optics\nand hybrid quantum information technologies."}

For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets\nfragment into two for increasing repulsive potential heights, a process that\noccurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at\nthe attractive potential, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed\ndroplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization\nanalysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and\nthe behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height\nare used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for repulsive\npotentials as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and\neventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of attractive\npotential wells. The many-body character of the dynamics is explicated by\nevaluating the participating single-particle eigenstates manifesting the\nsuperposition nature of the droplet state.

These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which\nwere recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a\nrestart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc.\nNatl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive\nanalysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on\nthe widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum\nstructure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the\nsymmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a\nmagnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of {the eigenvalues of\nthe unitary}, hence modifying {the mean recurrence time and the widening of the\ntransitions}, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances\nstudied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments\non quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.19"}
