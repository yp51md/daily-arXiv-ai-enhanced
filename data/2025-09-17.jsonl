By analyzing the inverse participation ratio and the\ncentroid position of the wave packet, the delocalization-localization phase\ndiagrams in the equilibrium state and the non-equilibrium steady state are\nobtained respectively. The stability of the system's initial state on\ndissipation and the dissipation-driven delocalization-localization transition\n(or vice versa) are discussed. The dynamic evolution behavior provides evidence\nfor the existence of the quantum Mpemba effect in this dissipation-modulated\nsystem. A starting-line hypothesis is proposed, which can be used to explain\nthe occurrence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect. In addition, the\nthermodynamic applications of this system have also been studied. The results\nprove that the localized phase is beneficial to the realization of quantum\nheater as well. Our work has promoted the understanding of the steady-state\nphase transitions and dynamic behaviors of dissipation-modulated quasiperiodic\nsystems, and has expanded the existing thermodynamic research on the\napplication of quasiperiodic systems."}

In many complex systems, however,\ndiffusion deviates from classical Brownian behaviour, exhibiting striking\nphenomena such as Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (BYNGD) and anomalous\ndiffusion. BYNGD describes a frequently observed statistical feature\ncharacterised by the coexistence of linear mean-square displacement (MSD) and\nnon-Gaussian displacement distributions. Anomalous diffusion, in contrast,\ninvolves a nonlinear time dependence of the MSD and often reflects mechanisms\nsuch as trapping, viscoelasticity, heterogeneity, or active processes. Both\nphenomena challenge the conventional framework based on constant diffusivity\nand Gaussian statistics. This review focuses the theoretical modelling of such\nbehaviour via the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity (LEFD) -- a\nflexible stochastic framework that captures essential features of diffusion in\nheterogeneous media. LEFD not only accounts for BYNGD but also naturally\nencompasses a wide range of anomalous transport phenomena, including\nsubdiffusion, ageing, and weak ergodicity breaking. Ergodicity is discussed in\nterms of the correspondence between time and ensemble averages, as well as the\ntrajectory-to-trajectory variability of time-averaged observables. The review\nfurther highlights the empirical relevance of LEFD and related models in\nexplaining diverse experimental observations and underscores their value to\nuncovering the physical mechanisms governing transport in complex systems."}

The quasi-ballistic\nthermal transport arises from the combination of wave-like and diffusive phonon\nbehaviors unlike pure diffusion. The topological nature has been known to be\ncompatible with both wave and diffusive phenomena. Therefore, topological\nphononic crystals have great potential for the development of controllable and\ndesignable thermal transport based on quasi-ballistic phonons. In this study,\nwe experimentally investigated the thermal behavior at the scale of\nquasi-ballistic phonon transport using a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model-based\ntopological phononic crystal. Quasi-ballistic phonon transport was observed\nthrough change in thermal conductivity depending on the structural parameters\nof topological systems using micro-thermoreflectance.

In particular, diagnosing long-range entanglement\nthrough the entropic area law suffers from spurious contributions, failing to\nunambiguously identify topological order. Here we devise a protocol based on\nthe ZX calculus, a graphical tensor network, to determine the topological order\nof a state circumventing entropy calculations. The protocol takes as input\nreal-space bipartitions of a state and returns a ZX contour diagram,\n$\\mathcal{D}_{\\partial A}$, displaying long-range graph connectivity only for\nlong-range entangled states. We validate the protocol by showing that the\ncontour diagrams of the toric and color codes are equivalent except for the\nnumber of non-local nodes, which differentiates their topological order. The\nnumber of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state\nsuperposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious\nentropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect\ntopological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of\ndiagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics."}

The\nnumber of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state\nsuperposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious\nentropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect\ntopological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of\ndiagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics."}

In\nthis work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum\nembedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA)\nframework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to\nrepresent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control\nmechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding\nloops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations\nof the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the\nexact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the\ncomputational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the\nhigh-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop,\nrather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the\ncritical need for more efficient inference techniques."}

For successive feedback control with a non-adaptive sequence\nof bare measurements (i.e., with positive Kraus operators), we prove that the\nsymmetry classification collapses to the ten-fold AZ$^\\dagger$ classes,\nspecifying the allowed topology of CPTP maps associated with feedback control.\nWe demonstrate that a chiral Maxwell's demon with Gaussian measurement errors\nexhibits quantized winding numbers. Moreover, for general (non-bare)\nmeasurements, we explicitly construct a protocol that falls outside the\nten-fold classification. These results broaden and clarify the principles in\nengineering topological aspects of quantum control robust against disorder and\nimperfections."}

All comments are welcome!", "summary": "Nanoelectromechanical resonators provide an ideal platform for investigating\nthe interplay between electron transport and nonlinear mechanical motion.\nExternally driven suspended carbon nanotubes, containing an electrostatically\ndefined quantum dot are especially promising. These devices possess two main\nsources of nonlinearity: the electromechanical coupling and the intrinsic\ncontributions of the resonator that induce a Duffing-like nonlinear behavior.\nIn this work, we observe the interplay between the two sources across different\ndriving regimes. The main nonlinear feature we observe is the emergence of\narch-like resonances in the electronic transport when the resonator is strongly\ndriven. We show that our model is in good agreement with our experimental\nelectron transport measurements on a suspended carbon nanotube. This\ncharacterization paves the way for the exploration of nonlinear phenomena using\nmesoscopic electromechanical resonators."}

QDFlow is an\nopen-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic\nsynthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent\nThomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to\nproduce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling\nexperiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models,\nQDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development,\nbenchmarking, and quantum device research."}
