If\nthe anyons are modeled as bosons with a magnetic flux attachment, and if the\ntotal magnetic flux is small compared to the number of particles, then an\naverage-field description becomes appropriate for the low-energy collective\nstate of the gas. Namely, by means of a Hartree-Jastrow ansatz, we derive a\ntwo-parameter Chern-Simons-Schr\\\"odinger energy functional which extends the\nwell-known Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger density functional theory\nto the magnetic (anyonic) self-interaction. One parameter determines the total\nnumber of self-generated magnetic flux units in the system, and the other the\neffective strength of spin-orbit self-interaction. This latter interaction can\nbe either attractive/focusing or repulsive/defocusing, and depends both on the\nintrinsic spin-orbit interaction and the relative length scale of the flux\nprofile of the anyons. Densities and energies of ground and excited states are\nstudied analytically and numerically for a wide range of the parameters and\nalign well with a sequence of exact nonlinear Landau levels describing\nJackiw-Pi self-dual solitons. With increasing flux, counter-rotating vortices\nare formed, enhancing the stability of the gas against collapse. Apart from\nclarifying the relations between various different anyon models that have\nappeared in the literature, our analysis sheds considerable new light on the\nmany-anyon spectral problem, and also exemplifies a novel\nsupersymmetry-breaking phenomenon."}

In most systems where\nstability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are\nconsidered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent\nperturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal\nphenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove\nthat it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the\nevolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the\ninstantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds\nremain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This\nflexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in\nproving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration\nspaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space\ncan induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break\nergodicity.

In most systems where\nstability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are\nconsidered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent\nperturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal\nphenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove\nthat it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the\nevolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the\ninstantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds\nremain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This\nflexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in\nproving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration\nspaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space\ncan induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break\nergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several\nsystems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving\nstate is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time\neven under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability\nof LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In\naddition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with\nclustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum\nHamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work\nprovides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic\nquantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and\nquantum algorithm design."}

In one-body\nsystems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by\nRuelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical\nlimit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the\nLiouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the\nslowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study\nthe kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of\nthe OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic\ngap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between\nintegrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a\nunified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed\nmany-body quantum systems."}

Recent developments have\nsignificantly reduced the space overhead of surgery.

We first present a general set of conditions that ensure\nfault-tolerant surgery operations can be performed with constant time overhead.\nThis fast surgery necessarily makes use of an auxiliary complex described by a\nhypergraph rather than a graph. We then introduce a concrete scheme called\nblock reading, which performs transversal surgery across multiple code blocks.\nWe further investigate surgery operations with intermediate time overhead,\nbetween $O(1)$ and $O(d)$, which apply to quantum locally testable codes.\nFinally, we establish a circuit equivalence between homomorphic measurement and\nhypergraph surgery and derive bounds on the time overhead of generic logical\nmeasurement schemes. Overall, our results demonstrate that reducing the time\ncost of code surgery is not reliant on the quantum memory being single-shot.\nInstead it is chiefly the connectivity between a code and its measurement\nancilla system that determines the achievable measurement time overhead."}
