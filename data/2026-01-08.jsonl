To examine the impact of controlled stoichiometric deviations on the electronic structure, UGe$_{2\\pm x}$ thin films ($0 \\le x \\le 1$) were prepared by triode sputtering and studied on pristine surfaces by X-ray (XPS) and Ultraviolet (UPS) photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS and UPS reveal a robust metallic valence band with a dominant U-5$f$ contribution at the Fermi level and a broad incoherent feature at higher binding energies, without qualitative changes in spectral line shape across the composition range. The experimental spectrum of UGe$_2$ thin films is well reproduced by DFT+U(ED) valence-band calculations combining density functional theory with exact diagonalization of the multiconfigurational U-5$f$ shell. These results demonstrate that the overall U-Ge electronic framework of UGe$_2$ thin films remains resilient to moderate stoichiometric deviations, providing a reliable electronic baseline for future studies of interface- and heterostructure-driven phenomena in uranium-based systems."}

Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems."}

Using both a symmetry analysis and model calculations on the breathing kagome lattice, we show how the altermagnetic spin textures in Mn$_3$Pt generate a spin splitting of the electronic bands that remains magnetization-free even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and, upon taking into account the proximity coupling across the interface, produces a superconducting diode effect. We also demonstrate that the angular dependence of the critical current provides a probe of the magnetic order. We hope that our work will contribute to the understanding and further discovery of candidate materials for novel altermagnet-superconductor hybrid devices."}

As opposed to spin-orbit coupling, the splitting resulting from these \"altermagnets\" is not a small relativistic correction and, in contrast to ferromagnets, not accompanied by a net magnetization and large stray fields. In particular, the theoretical analysis of the interplay of altermagnetism and superconductivity has taken center stage, while experimental investigations of their coexistence remain in their infancy. We here study heterostructures consisting of Nb thins films interfaced with the $T_1$ and $T_2$ phases of Mn$_3$Pt. These non-collinear magnetic states can be thought of as descendants from the same altermagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the non-trivial impact on the superconducting state of Nb, which exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, despite the compensated ($T_2$) and nearly-compensated ($T_1$) magnetic order; the diode efficiencies can reach large values (up to 50$\\%$). The diode effect is found to be highly sensitive to the form of the magnetic order, illustrating its potential as a symmetry probe. The complex magnetic field and temperature dependence hint at a rich interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Our results define a new materials paradigm for dissipationless spintronics and magnetization-free diode functionality, while motivating further exploration of non-collinear altermagnetic superconductors."}

For chain reactions, various characteristics of multifractal neutron behavior have been determined. These include the dimension of the multifractal carrier, information and correlation dimensions, the entropy of the fractal set, maximum and minimum dimension values, and the multifractal spectrum function. The geometric features of a multifractal allow for the description of a stochastic system consisting of hierarchically subordinate statistical ensembles, which are characterized by Cayley trees. A stationary distribution over hierarchical levels is established, which follows the Tsallis power law. The text also points out some potential applications of fractal patterns in nuclear reactor theory. The chance of percolation, which is when we see a state in the Bethe lattice where there's at least one continuous path through neighboring conducting nodes all the way across, is similar to the likelihood of a self-sustaining fission chain reaction happening. When this probability hits a critical point, we get a (conditionally) infinite cluster of neutrons forming. The percolation probability, influenced by how long the reactor has been running and its size, is linked to the reactor's criticality. We take a look at how the neutron multiplication factor behaves over time. We especially focus on the early stages of a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. We also highlight the ways to identify the boundaries of the critical region."}

In this work, we propose a cat state preparation scheme based on preparing two cat states with low-depth circuits, followed by a transversal CNOT and measurement of one of the states. This scheme prepares $w$-qubit cat states fault-tolerantly up to fault distances of $9$ using $\\lceil\\log_2 w\\rceil+1$ depth and at most $3w-2$ CNOTs and $2w$ qubits. We discuss that the combinatorially challenging aspect of this construction is the precise wiring of the transversal CNOT and propose three methods for finding these: two based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory solving and one heuristic search based on a local repair strategy. Numerical evaluations show that our circuits achieve a high fault-distance while requiring fewer resources as generalized constructions."}

This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD).

This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions.

The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=π/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $π$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase.

We then study space-time fluctuations in the steady state, at the umbilic manifold, which are expected to exhibit universal scaling features. We formulate an effective mode-coupling theory (MCT) for the multilane model within the umbilic subspace and test its predictions. Unlike in the bidirectional two-lane model with an umbilic point studied earlier, here we find a robust $z=3/2$ dynamical exponent for the umbilic mode. The umbilic scaling function, obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations, for the simplest 3-lane scenario, appears to have an universal shape for a range of interaction parameters. Remarkably, the shape and dynamic exponent of the non-degenerate mode can be analytically predicted on the base of effective MCT, up to non-universal scaling factor.

This paramp, which amplifies signals in both parts at room and cryogenic temperatures, can be used to generate both the two-mode and single-mode squeezing of either system. It requires merely modulating the frequency of the spin ensemble at the sum of the cavity and spin frequencies (providing the classical pump) with the two systems sufficiently detuned. This effect is remarkable given that modulating a spin ensemble by itself produces neither amplification nor squeezing, unlike modulating an oscillator, and that an off-resonant perturbative analysis would suggest that modulating the spin ensemble merely parametrically drives the cavity mode. With typical cavity parameters including a cavity quality factor~$Q=10^4$, and a 1 GHz modulation amplitude, the microwave signal can be amplified by approximately $18~\\mbox{dB}$ in $1.7~\\mbox{$μ$s}$, with a resonant bandwidth of about $0.5~\\mbox{MHz}$.

Interestingly, efficiency is comparable when the relative magnitude of $κ$ and $J$ is the same but of opposite signs. The above results are explained due to a subtle interplay of frustration, quantum fluctuation, and duality of eigen-spectra for the KH system when both the signs of $κ$ and $J$ are reversed. The maximum efficiency is shown to be dynamically related to eigen-spectra forming discrete narrow bands, where total spin angular momentum becomes a good quantum number. We relate this optimum efficiency to the realization of weakly interacting magnons, where the system reduces to an approximate eigen-system of the external drive. Finally, we extend our study to the large spin Kitaev model and find a quantum advantage in efficiency for $S=1/2$.

Achieving a single electron source using an industrial grade 300 mm wafer silicon metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) process could offer a powerful route for scaling, combined with the ability for integration with control and measurement electronics. Here, we present measurements of such a single-electron source indicating an error rate of 0.008 ppm, below the error threshold to satisfy the SI Ampere, and one of the lowest error rates reported, implemented using a gate-defined quantum dot device fabricated on an industry-grade silicon MOS process. Further evidence supporting the accuracy of the device is obtained by comparing the device performance to established models of quantum tunnelling, which reveal the mechanism of operation of our source at the single particle level.

The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=π/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $π$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our work establishes initial-state squeezing as a versatile tool for tailoring far-from-equilibrium criticality and reveals a direct link between entanglement saturation and universal nonanalytic dynamics."}

For such codes the Z-detector hypergraph decomposes into independent strip components and maximum-likelihood $Z$ decoding factorizes across strips, yielding complexity savings for matching-based decoders. We characterize strip symmetry via per-strip stabilizer products, viewed as a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ 1-form symmetry, place XZZX, the domain wall color code, and $X^3Z^3$ in this framework, and introduce synthetic strip-symmetric detector models and domain-wise Clifford constructions that serve as design tools for new bias-tailored Floquet codes."}

An approach to alleviating these demands is provided by adaptive measurement strategies, which can yield up to a quadratic improvement in reconstruction accuracy for pure states by dynamically optimizing measurement settings during data acquisition. A key open question is whether these asymptotic advantages remain in realistic experiments, where readout is inevitably noisy. In this work, we analyze the impact of readout noise on adaptive quantum state tomography with readout-error mitigation, focusing on the challenging regime of reconstructing pure states using mixed-state estimators. Using analytical arguments based on Fisher information optimization and extensive numerical simulations using Bayesian inference, we show that any nonzero readout noise eliminates the asymptotic quadratic scaling advantage of adaptive strategies. We numerically investigate the behavior for finite measurement statistics for single- and two-qubit systems with exact readout-error mitigation and find a gradual transition from ideal to sub-optimal scaling. We furthermore investigate realistic scenarios where detector tomography is performed with a limited number of state copies for calibration, showing that insufficient detector characterization leads to estimator bias and limited reconstruction accuracy. Although our result imposes an upper bound on the reconstruction accuracy that can be achieved with adaptive strategies, we nevertheless observe numerically a constant-factor gain in reconstruction accuracy, which becomes larger as the readout noise decreases. This indicates potential practical benefits in using adaptive measurement strategies in well-calibrated experiments."}

However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $δ_\\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \\times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\\mathrm{i} \\approx 1.9\\,\\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication."}

These interferometers exhibit two main advantages. First, they enable probing a sample at a chosen wavelength while detecting light at a different wavelength with high efficiency (bicolor quantum imaging and sensing with undetected light). Second, they can show quantum-enhanced sensitivities below the shot-noise limit, potentially reaching Heisenberg-limited precision in parameter estimation. Here, we compare three quantum-imaging configurations using only easily accessible intensity-based measurements for phase estimation: a Yurke-type SU(1,1) interferometer, a Mandel-type induced-coherence interferometer, and a hybrid scheme that continuously interpolates between them. While an ideal Yurke interferometer can exhibit Heisenberg scaling, this advantage is known to be fragile under realistic detection constraints and in the presence of loss. We demonstrate that differential intensity detection in the Mandel interferometer provides the highest and most robust phase sensitivity among the considered schemes, reaching but not surpassing the shot-noise limit, even in the presence of loss. Intensity measurements in a Yurke-type configuration can achieve genuine sub-shot-noise sensitivity under balanced losses and moderate gain; however, their performance degrades in realistic high-gain regimes. Consequently, in this regime, the Mandel configuration with differential detection outperforms the Yurke-type setup and constitutes the most robust approach for phase estimation."}

We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales."}

Schreiber"], "title": "Conveyor-mode electron shuttling through a T-junction in Si/SiGe", "comment": "16 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "Conveyor-mode shuttling in gated Si/SiGe devices enables adiabatic transfer of single electrons, electron patterns and spin qubits confined in quantum dots across several microns with a scalable number of signal lines. To realize their full potential, linear shuttle lanes must connect into a two-dimensional grid with controllable routing. We introduce a T-junction device linking two independently driven shuttle lanes. Electron routing across the junction requires no extra control lines beyond the four channels per conveyor belt. We measure an inter-lane charge transfer fidelity of $F = 100.0000000^{+0}_{-9\\times 10^{-7}}\\,\\%$ at an instantaneous electron velocity of $270\\,\\mathrm{mm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The filling of 54 quantum dots is controlled by simple atomic pulses, allowing us to swap electron patterns, laying the groundwork for a native spin-qubit SWAP gate. This T-junction establishes a path towards scalable, two-dimensional quantum computing architectures with flexible spin qubit routing for quantum error correction."}
