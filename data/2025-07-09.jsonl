Nevertheless, their medium-range structure has remained elusive.\nPrevious studies focused on the ring statistics as a metric for the\nmedium-range structure, which, however, provides an incomplete picture of the\nglassy structure. Here, we use atomistic simulations and state-of-the-art\ntopological analysis tools, namely persistent homology (PH), to analyze the\nmedium-range structure of the archetypal oxide glass (Silica) at ambient\ntemperatures and with varying pressures. PH presents an unbiased definition of\nloops and voids, providing an advantage over other methods for studying the\nstructure and topology of complex materials, such as glasses, across multiple\nlength scales. We captured subtle topological transitions in medium-range order\nand cavity distributions, providing new insights into glass structure.

Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on\nlexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation\njump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological\nDifferentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts\nby analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is\napplied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD\nscores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature\n(cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak\ncorrelations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across\n$\\sim$~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50\\% of the\nentries in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely\nindependent, definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine\nsimilarity becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed\nfrom the dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths\ngenerated by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP)\nacross networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower\ncumulative OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces\ntrajectories more coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as\nmeasured by OD.

While conventional quantum protocols often rely on\nexplicit transmission of decryption keys or phase parameters, such models\nexpose critical vulnerabilities to eavesdropping. To address this challenge, we\npropose a two-stage encryption-decryption mechanism. The first stage employs\nrandomized phase modulation protected by active electromagnetic shielding to\nconceal the quantum signal from unauthorized interception. The second stage\nenables legitimate receivers to retrieve encrypted phase data using entangled\nquantum states, eliminating the need for classical key transfer. A formal\nmathematical framework is developed to describe the two-stage encoding and\ndecryption process, including phase-modulated entangled states and their\ntransformation under nonlocal correlation and adversarial noise. Simulation\nmetrics confirm that the hybrid system preserves quantum coherence with\nvisibility above 94% and entanglement negativity of 0.86, even under dynamic\nshielding and transmission noise.

The regression theorem (or hypothesis) serves\nas a key tool in this context, offering a seemingly straightforward approach.\nHowever, it fails for systems strongly coupled to their surroundings, where\nmemory effects become significant. Here, we extend the analysis of temporal\ncorrelations beyond the regression theorem, revealing what can be learned about\nopen quantum systems when this hypothesis fails. We introduce robust,\noperationally meaningful methods to explore how the breakdown of the regression\nhypothesis can uncover fundamental quantum features of non-Markovian open\nsystems, including entanglement, coherence, and quantum memory, namely, the\nfundamental impossibility of simulating memory in non-Markov processes with\nclassical feedback mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate how these quantum\nfeatures are linked to microscopic properties such as the bath spectral density\nand heat flow."}

In\nsuperconducting implementations, increasing the microwave drive on the\nnonlinear oscillator that hosts the Kerr-cat qubit should, in principle,\nfurther enhance this bias. Instead, experiments reveal that above a critical\ndrive amplitude the tunneling time - the less dominant decay channel - ceases\nto increase and even decreases.

We\nuncover this mechanism by retaining the full circuit nonlinearities and\ntreating the strong drive exactly within a Floquet-Markov framework that\nincorporates quasidegeneracies in the Kerr-cat spectrum.
