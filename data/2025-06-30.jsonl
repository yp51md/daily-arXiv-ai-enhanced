As a result, only towards a specific moving direction\nand beyond a critical velocity, the acquired spin polarization can trigger\ncollective interactions sufficient for self-binding and drive a first-order\ntransition from gas to droplet.

Ultimately, the purity of state-of-the-art single-photon sources was\nfound to be limited by spontaneous emission and subsequent reexcitation during\nthe interaction with the driving field. Here, we demonstrate that even this\nfundamental limit to the single-photon purity can be overcome due to the\ndistinct spectro-temporal properties of the individual photons forming\nmulti-photon errors. For driving pulses shorter than the emitter lifetime, we\nfind that photons emitted during the pulse exhibit a significantly broader\nspectral shape than the emitter's natural linewidth. Thus, we can selectively\nfilter out the majority of this instantaneously emitted photon by employing\nnarrowband spectral filters which reduces the measured degree of second-order\ncoherence at zero time delay by almost one order of magnitude.
