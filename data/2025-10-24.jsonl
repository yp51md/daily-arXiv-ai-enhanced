It is natural to ask: what happens when an\nextensive number of such systems are coupled together? A simple renormalization\ngroup argument implies that in a chain of SU(N) multichannel quantum systems,\nwhere each spin is coupled to its own bath of K channels, the individual spins\ndynamically decouple at low energy when N>K, resulting in a 'sliding' non-Fermi\nliquid. Using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we find evidences of a\ncontinuous, 'dimensionality-changing' phase transition out of this non-Fermi\nliquid into a valence-bond solid phase as the intersite coupling is increased.\nRemarkably, at the critical point, correlations exhibit a power-law behavior\neven along the direction in which the spins are coupled, indicating the\nbreakdown of dynamical decoupling at the transition. We also develop an RG\nscheme to understand the universal aspects of this transition."}

Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the\nmagnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we\nshow that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and\ndeep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a\npurely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a\nminimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which\ncorresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the\nmechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\\it classical} circuit model.\nWe also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum\nquantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations\nassociated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy,\nproviding a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum\nresources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further\ndemonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon\nband edges as a function of the external magnetic field.

Rev. B 111, 125157 (2025)}], and it has been demonstrated\nthat the renormalization effect generated by strong correlations\ncounterintuitively changes the nature of dissipation into an emergent many-body\ndissipation that causes a Kondo breakdown. In a closely related context, it is\nalso known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo\nbreakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson\nimpurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model\nthat provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the\nslave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo\nbreakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact\nBethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson\nmean-field theory. Finally, we point out that the Lehmann representation for\nthe non-Hermitian Green function cannot be obtained by the analytic\ncontinuation to the complex energy upon the Kondo breakdown, where the\nanalyticity of the non-Hermitian Green function in the half-complex-$\\omega$\nplane no longer holds."}

Topological superconductors with separated Majorana bound states\n(MBSs) provide a strong form of protection that only depends on the locality of\nperturbations. While the link between MBS separation, robust degeneracy, and\nprotected braiding is well understood in non-interacting systems, recent\nexperimental progress in short quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains highlights the\nneed to establish these connections rigorously for interacting systems. We do\nthis by defining MBSs from many-body ground states and show how their locality\nconstrains their coupling to an environment.
