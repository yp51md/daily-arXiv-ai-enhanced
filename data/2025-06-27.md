Abstract: Micrometer-scale thin diamond devices are key components for various quantum
sensing and networking experiments, including the integration of color centers
into optical microcavities. In this work, we introduce a laser-cutting method
for patterning microdevices from millimeter-sized diamond membranes. The method
can be used to fabricate devices with micrometer thicknesses and edge lengths
of typically 10 $\mu m$ to 100 $\mu m$. We compare this method with an
established nanofabrication process based on electron-beam lithography, a
two-step transfer pattern utilizing a silicon nitride hard mask material, and
reactive ion etching. Microdevices fabricated using both methods are bonded to
a cavity Bragg mirror and characterized using scanning cavity microscopy. We
record two-dimensional cavity finesse maps over the devices, revealing insights
about the variation in diamond thickness, surface quality, and strain. The
scans demonstrate that devices fabricated by laser-cutting exhibit similar
properties to devices obtained by the conventional method. Finally, we show
that the devices host optically coherent Tin- and Nitrogen-Vacancy centers
suitable for applications in quantum networking.

Abstract: Color center spins in diamond nanostructures are a key resource for emerging
quantum technologies. Their innate surface proximity makes precise control of
diamond surface chemistry essential for optimizing their functionality and
charge states. However, conventional surface functionalization methods
typically lack the tunability and efficiency required for robust charge-state
control. Here, we introduce a deterministic, nonvolatile technique for
continuously and efficiently tuning diamond's surface termination via
laser-induced oxidation of H-terminated diamond nanopillars. By tracking
SiV$^-$ photoluminescence as a charge-state proxy, we uncover the microscopic
mechanism of this photocatalytic process through a systematic photon-flux and
-energy analysis, where we identify charge-cycling of native defects as sources
of optically generated holes driving the desired surface oxidation. Our results
suggest that our method applies broadly to other color centers and host
materials, offering a versatile tool for on-demand charge-state control and
surface engineering in solid-state quantum devices.

Result: 测得Purcell因子为7.3±1.6，相干光子探测概率为0.5%，并实现了多量子比特态的生成和测量。

Conclusion: 该系统显著提升了光子收集效率，为量子网络应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: An efficient interface between a spin qubit and single photons is a key
enabling system for quantum science and technology. We report on a coherently
controlled diamond nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin qubit that is
optically interfaced with an open microcavity. Through Purcell enhancement and
an asymmetric cavity design, we achieve efficient collection of resonant
photons, while on-chip microwave lines allow for spin qubit control at a 10 MHz
Rabi frequency. With the microcavity tuned to resonance with the
nitrogen-vacancy center's optical transition, we use excited state lifetime
measurements to determine a Purcell factor of 7.3 $\pm$ 1.6. Upon pulsed
resonant excitation, we find a coherent photon detection probability of 0.5 %
per pulse. Although this result is limited by the finite excitation
probability, it already presents an order of magnitude improvement over the
solid immersion lens devices used in previous quantum network demonstrations.
Furthermore, we use resonant optical pulses to initialize and read out the
electron spin. By combining the efficient interface with spin qubit control, we
generate two-qubit and three-qubit spin-photon states and measure heralded
Z-basis correlations between the photonic time-bin qubits and the spin qubit.

Motivation: 探索高维量子系统中基于测量的量子计算，寻找比传统簇态更高效的资源状态。

Method: 使用对角或块对角Clifford操作作为纠缠门，分析资源状态的内在单量子门及其对计算的影响。

Result: 证明了实现任意单量子门操作的条件，并展示了不同纠缠门带来的计算复杂度差异。提供了两种更高效的qutrit资源状态示例。

Conclusion: 通过改变资源状态的纠缠门，可以实现更高效的量子信息传输和处理，为高维量子计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: We show how to perform measurement-based quantum computing on qudits
(high-dimensional quantum systems) using alternative resource states beyond the
cluster state. Here, the entangling gate, characterizing the resource state, is
a diagonal or block-diagonal Clifford operation instead of the usual
controlled-phase gate for cluster states. This simple change has remarkable
consequences: the applied entangling operation determines an intrinsic
single-qudit gate associated with the resource that drives the quantum
computation when performing single-qudit measurements on the resource state. We
prove a condition for the intrinsic gate allowing for the measurement-based
implementation of arbitrary single-qudit unitaries. Furthermore, for
prime-power-dimensional qudits, we demonstrate that the complexity of the
realization depends linearly on the dimension and the Pauli order of the
intrinsic gate so that different entangling gates are associated with different
computational overheads. In particular, we provide two examples of qutrit
resource states, which allow more efficient quantum information transport and
processing than the qutrit cluster state. Finally, we discuss the required
two-dimensional geometry of the resource state for universal measurement-based
quantum computing.

toggling-frame Hamiltonian and the full set of achievable, zeroth-order,
effective Hamiltonians. Examples are included to illustrate the process flow
and resultant precision and robustness.

Result: 在热源带宽足够窄时，量子比特达到稳态纠缠；温度过高时纠缠态崩溃。

Conclusion: 非马尔可夫性热源可用于光学、微波和声子网络的量子通信。

Abstract: We describe a novel scheme for the generation of stationary entanglement
between two separated qubits that are driven by a purely thermal photon source.
While in this scenario the qubits remain in a separable state at all times when
the source is broadband, i.e. Markovian, the qubits relax into an entangled
steady state once the bandwidth of the thermal source is sufficiently reduced.
We explain this phenomenon by the appearance of a quasiadiabatic dark state and
identify the most relevant nonadiabatic corrections that eventually lead to a
breakdown of the entangled state, once the temperature is too high. This effect
demonstrates how the non-Markovianity of an otherwise incoherent reservoir can
be harnessed for quantum communication applications in optical, microwave, and
phononic networks. As two specific examples, we discuss the use of filtered
room-temperature noise as a passive resource for entangling distant
superconducting qubits in a cryogenic quantum link or solid-state spin qubits
in a phononic quantum channel.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量子传感中，退相干和参数不确定性使得最优控制变得困难，传统的目标状态或变换方法在多参数估计中效果不佳。

Method: 采用SAC算法训练RL代理，通过数值模拟自旋系统优化横向场脉冲序列，以提高测量精度。

Result: RL代理对系统参数（如脉冲持续时间和初始态纯度）敏感，但能较好地泛化到未训练的情况。

Conclusion: 研究表明RL在量子最优控制中具有潜力，特别是在复杂和不确定的环境中。

Abstract: Quantum optimal control in the presence of decoherence is difficult,
particularly when not all Hamiltonian parameters are known precisely, as in
quantum sensing applications. In this context, maximizing the sensitivity of
the system is the objective, for which the optimal target state or unitary
transformations are unknown, especially in the case of multi-parameter
estimation. Here, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning (RL),
specifically the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, for problems in quantum
optimal control. We adopt a spin-based magnetometer as a benchmarking system
for the efficacy of the SAC algorithm. In such systems, the magnitude of a
background magnetic field acting on a spin can be determined via projective
measurements. The precision of the determined magnitude can be optimized by
applying pulses of transverse fields with different strengths. We train an RL
agent on numerical simulations of the spin system to determine a
transverse-field pulse sequence that optimizes the precision and compare it to
existing sensing strategies. We evaluate the agent's performance against
various Hamiltonian parameters, including values not seen in training, to
investigate the agent's ability to generalize to different situations. We find
that the RL agents are sensitive to certain parameters of the system, such as
the pulse duration and the purity of the initial state, but overall are able to
generalize well, supporting the use of RL in quantum optimal control settings.

Result: 新方法将运行时间成本降低了110倍，显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子计算的实际应用提供了更乐观的前景。

Abstract: Finding the solution to linear ordinary differential equations of the form
$\partial_t u(t) = -A(t)u(t)$ has been a promising theoretical avenue for
\textit{asymptotic} quantum speedups. However, despite the improvements to
existing quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known
about \textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it
challenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In
this work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum
differential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation
(LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a
unitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make
several algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization
bounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme
for the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for
oblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the
best of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art
by at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if
state preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous
resource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the
most general case whereby the dynamics are not \textit{fast-forwardable}, these
findings provide a 110x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis contributes
towards establishing more promising applications for quantum computing.

Motivation: 高维系统中贝尔不等式测试面临多结果测量的挑战，传统方法存在二元化漏洞。

Method: 利用双光子纠缠态的联合光谱强度进行多结果测量。

Result: 在d=8维度下违反CGLMP贝尔不等式，p值可忽略，首次关闭高维贝尔实验中的二元化漏洞。

Conclusion: 仅需频率测量即可保证非局域相关性，简化了未来高维量子信息协议的实现。

Abstract: Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum
information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell
inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome
measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections
opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit.
Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state
contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this
obstacle and certify nonlocality for high-dimensional states. This result is
contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive
quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or
nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to
dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the
binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing
nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the
technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly
simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum
information protocols.

Abstract: We suggest a protocol for the sympathetic cooling of a molecular asymmetric
top rotor co-trapped with laser-cooled atomic ions,based on resonant coupling
between the molecular ion's electric dipole moment and a common vibrational
mode of the trapped particles. By combining sympathetic sideband laser cooling
with coherent microwave excitation, we demonstrate the efficient depopulation
of arbitrary rotational subspaces and the ability to cool an incoherent
distribution of rotational states into a single, well-defined quantum state.
This capability opens the door to exploiting the rotational Hilbert space for
applications in quantum information processing and high-precision spectroscopy.

the thin cylinder limit, where these states have simple descriptions. We then
develop a matrix product representation of the states on arbitrary cylinders,
which leads to a natural protocol to efficiently grow them. We explain how our
approach can be adapted to other quantum computing hardware.

Conclusion: 新的非绝热ImF速率理论解决了先前方法的不足，但在高温速率理论中仍需改进。

Abstract: Semiclassical instanton theory captures nuclear quantum effects such as
tunnelling in chemical reactions. It was originally derived from two different
starting points, the flux correlation function and the ImF premise. In pursuit
of a nonadiabatic rate theory, a number of methods have been proposed; almost
all based on the less rigorous ImF premise. Only recently, we introduced a
rigorous nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory in the
flux-correlation function framework which successfully bridges from the
Born-Oppenheimer to the golden-rule limit. Here, we examine the previous
ImF-based attempts and conclude that they do not capture the two limits
correctly. In particular, we will highlight how the last in a series of
developments, called mean-field ring-polymer instanton theory, breaks down in
the golden-rule limit. We develop a new nonadiabatic ImF rate theory to remedy
the failings of previous attempts while taking inspiration from them. We also
consider the crossover from deep tunnelling to a high-temperature rate theory.
We test our new nonadiabatic ImF theory on a range of models including
asymmetric and multidimensional systems and we show reliable results for the
deep-tunnelling regime but limitations for the related high-temperature rate
theory.

Abstract: The Ising model serves as a canonical platform for exploring emergent
symmetry in quantum critical systems. The critical point of the 1D Ising chain
is described by a conformal Ising field theory, which remains integrable in the
presence of a magnetic perturbation leading to massive particles associated
with the exceptional Lie algebra $E_8$. Coupling two Ising chains in a ladder
leads to an even richer $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$ symmetry. Experimental signatures
of the associated particle excitations have arguably been observed in
scattering studies of the spin chain material CoNb$_2$O$_6$. Here, we probe
these emergent symmetries in a Rydberg atom quantum processing unit, leveraging
its tunable geometry to realize both chain and ladder configurations. We
identify mass spectra consistent with $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$
symmetries at the respective critical points. Our results demonstrate the power
of Rydberg platforms for investigating symmetry emergence in quantum many-body
systems and provide a direct window into the interplay of confinement, geometry
and criticality.

Abstract: The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for
the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential
applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum
simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum
phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field
Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce
a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous
wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface
phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated
quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting
quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum
algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields
responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the
system.

Conclusion: 狄拉克方程直接揭示了ZBW的本质，与经典电子模型的结论一致，表明这些模型与狄拉克方程等价。

Abstract: Despite the widespread belief that Dirac's wave equation does not exhibit
electron paths, they are hiding in plain sight. The worldline of a free
electron is revealed by applying Dirac's velocity operator to its wave function
whose space-time arguments are expressed in a proper time by a Lorentz
transformation. This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the electron's
global motion of its inertia (or spin) center and an inherent local periodic
motion about this point that produces the electron's spin. The latter has the
ultra-high ZBW (zitterbewegung) frequency $\omega_0$ found by Schr\"{o}dinger
in his operator analysis of Dirac's equation and so is appropriately called the
\emph{zitter motion}. The decomposition corresponds to Gordon's decomposition
of Dirac's current where the so-called polarization and magnetization currents
are due to the zitter motion. In an inertial "rest"-frame fixed at the inertia
center, Dirac's wave function corresponding to the electron spin in a specified
direction implies that a free electron of mass $m$ moves in an inherent
perpetual zitter motion at the speed of light $c$ in a circle of radius
$c/\omega_0 = \hbar /(2mc)$ about the inertia center in a plane orthogonal to
this spin direction. The electron continuously accelerates about the spin
center without any external force because the inertia is effective at the spin
center, rather than at its charge center where the electron interacts with the
electro-magnetic potential. This analysis confirms the nature of ZBW directly
from Dirac's equation, agreeing with the conclusions of Barut and Zanghi, Beck,
Hestenes, Rivas and Salesi from their classical electron models. Furthermore,
these five classical models are equivalent and express the same free electron
dynamics as Dirac's equation.

Abstract: Preparation of quantum thermal states of many-body systems is a key
computational challenge for quantum processors, with applications in physics,
chemistry, and classical optimization. We provide a simple and efficient
algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting
and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately
satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point
$\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma
-\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling
and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive
numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the
protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the
finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition.
Our algorithm provides a path to efficient quantum simulation of
quantum-correlated states at finite temperature with current and near-term
quantum processors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合量子-经典gGut方法，利用量子计算机计算嵌入哈密顿量的基态性质，显著降低了计算成本，并成功模拟了金属-绝缘体相变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统gGut方法在计算嵌入模型密度矩阵时存在算法瓶颈，限制了其效率。为了解决这一问题，研究团队开发了一种结合量子计算的新方法。

Method: 采用基于样本的量子选择构型相互作用（QSCI）算法，结合局部酉簇Jastrow（LUCJ）变分量子态和电路切割技术，在量子硬件上实现计算。

Result: 研究发现，随着幽灵轨道数量的增加，感兴趣的基态在CI基中变得稀疏。QSCI方法仅需1%的CI基态即可收敛，成功模拟了Bethe晶格上的金属-绝缘体相变。

Conclusion: 混合量子-经典gGut方法在保持精度的同时显著降低了计算成本，为量子计算在材料模拟中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ghost Gutzwiller ansatz (gGut) embedding technique was shown to achieve
comparable accuracy to the gold standard dynamical mean-field theory method in
simulating real material properties, yet at a much lower computational cost.
Despite that, gGut is limited by the algorithmic bottleneck of computing the
density matrix of the underlying effective embedding model, a quantity which
must be converged within a self-consistent embedding loop. We develop a hybrid
quantum-classical gGut technique which computes the ground state properties of
embedding Hamiltonians with the help of a quantum computer, using the
sample-based quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) algorithm. We
study the applicability of SCI-based methods to the evaluation of the density
of states for single-band Anderson impurity models within gGut and find that
such ground states of interest become sufficiently sparse in the CI basis as
the number of ghost orbitals is increased. Further, we investigate the
performance of QSCI using local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) variational
quantum states in combination with a circuit cutting technique, prepared on
IQM's quantum hardware for system sizes of up to 11 ghost orbitals, equivalent
to 24 qubits. We report converged gGut calculations which correctly capture the
metal-to-insulator phase transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Bethe
lattice by using quantum samples to build an SCI basis with as little as $1\%$
of the total CI basis states.

Abstract: Quantum simulators offer a new opportunity for the experimental exploration
of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics, which have traditionally been
characterized through expectation values or entanglement measures, based on
density matrices of the system. Recently, a more general framework for studying
quantum many-body systems based on projected ensembles has been introduced,
revealing novel quantum phenomena, such as deep thermalization in chaotic
systems. Here, we experimentally investigate a chaotic quantum many-body system
using projected ensembles on a superconducting processor with 16 qubits on a
square lattice. Our results provide direct evidence of deep thermalization by
observing a Haar-distributed projected ensemble for the steady states within a
charge-conserved sector. Moreover, by introducing an ensemble-averaged entropy
as a metric, we establish a benchmark for many-body information leakage from
the system to its environment. Our work paves the way for studying quantum
many-body dynamics using projected ensembles and shows a potential implication
for advancing quantum simulation techniques.

Conclusion: 弱测量协议提供了一种在希尔伯特空间内描述量子系统的方法，且首次击中时间与耦合参数相关。

Abstract: We study the first detected recurrence time problem of continuous-time
quantum walks on graphs. While previous works have employed projective
measurements to determine the first return time, we implement a protocol based
on weak measurements on a dilated system, enabling minimally invasive
monitoring throughout the evolution. To achieve this, we extend the theoretical
framework and complement it with both numerical simulations and experimental
investigations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite the implementation of a
generalized measurement, our modified formalism of weak recurrence provides a
description purely within the Hilbert space of the quantum system. Our results
reveal that the first hitting time scales inversely with the coupling parameter
between the ancilla and the quantum system.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合量子-经典强化学习框架用于台湾股市的板块轮动，发现量子增强模型在训练奖励上表现更好，但在实际投资指标上不如经典模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子增强模型在金融领域的应用潜力，特别是板块轮动策略。

Method: 结合PPO算法、经典架构（LSTM、Transformer）和量子增强模型（QNN、QRWKV、QASA），并采用自动化特征工程。

Result: 量子模型在训练奖励上表现更优，但在实际投资指标（如累计收益和夏普比率）上不如经典模型。

Conclusion: 当前奖励设计可能导致对短期波动的过拟合，未来需改进奖励设计、模型正则化和验证方法。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for
sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical
architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV,
QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline
extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent
model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key
finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training
rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics
such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core
challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,
the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our
analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to
short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue
is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of
quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We
discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions
for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and
validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and
critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum
reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为参数化量子电路的等价性验证提供了可行方案，尤其适用于参数较多的情况。

Abstract: Many promising quantum algorithms in economics, medical science, and material
science rely on circuits that are parameterized by a large number of angles. To
ensure that these algorithms are efficient, these parameterized circuits must
be heavily optimized. However, most quantum circuit optimizers are not
verified, so this procedure is known to be error-prone. For this reason, there
is growing interest in the design of equivalence checking algorithms for
parameterized quantum circuits. In this paper, we define a generalized class of
parameterized circuits with arbitrary rotations and show that this problem is
decidable for cyclotomic gate sets. We propose a cutoff-based procedure which
reduces the problem of verifying the equivalence of parameterized quantum
circuits to the problem of verifying the equivalence of finitely many
parameter-free quantum circuits. Because the number of parameter-free circuits
grows exponentially with the number of parameters, we also propose a
probabilistic variant of the algorithm for cases when the number of parameters
is intractably large. We show that our techniques extend to equivalence modulo
global phase, and describe an efficient angle sampling procedure for cyclotomic
gate sets.

Abstract: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell nonlocality have been
individually examined through many experiments. In this Letter, we
systematically characterize all of this quantumness in a unified manner. We
first construct universal uncertainty relations to reveal intrinsic features of
incompatible measurements, which include all the state-independent
uncertainties as special cases. We further extend to witness both quantum
coherence and Bell nonlocality. We finally perform experiments with unified
two-photon states, and validate the uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell
nonlocality within the experimental error. Our methods for witnessing
quantumness are valuable in characterizing quantum correlations in quantum
information processing.

Abstract: Nonlocality is a key feature of quantum networks and is being studied for its
potential applications in quantum communication and computing. Understanding
and harnessing nonlocality in quantum networks could lead to the development of
faster and more secure communication systems. All the nonclassicalities are
limited to discrete variable quantum networks. We propose the first method to
verify the network nonlocality of all optical quantum network consisting of two
entangled states where one-way classical communication is allowed. This
provides the first device-independent method to verify the quantum correlations
generated from all optical continuous-variable quantum networks.

Motivation: To demonstrate that transmon qubits can achieve quantum supremacy in Fock state boson sampling, expanding their applications.

Method: Introducing $q$ boson Fock state sampling and mapping it to the $q$ boson formalism.

Result: Transmons are shown capable of performing $q$ boson sampling, achieving quantum supremacy.

Conclusion: This work broadens the scope of transmon-based quantum processors and opens new possibilities in quantum computation.

Abstract: Transmon qubits have traditionally been regarded as limited to random circuit
sampling, incapable of performing Fock state boson sampling, a problem known to
be classically intractable. This work challenges that assumption by introducing
$q$ boson Fock state sampling, a variant in which transmon qubits can operate
effectively. Through direct mapping to the $q$ boson formalism, we demonstrate
that transmons possess the capability to achieve quantum supremacy in $q$ boson
sampling tasks. This finding expands the potential applications of
transmon-based quantum processors and paves the way for new avenues in quantum
computation.

Result: 该算法是目前发现的最大类图上的确定性量子搜索方法，统一了先前研究的多种图。

Conclusion: 本文为设计确定性量子搜索算法提供了统一框架，扩展了适用图的类别。

Abstract: Searching for an unknown marked vertex on a given graph (also known as
spatial search) is an extensively discussed topic in the area of quantum
algorithms, with a plethora of results based on different quantum walk models
and targeting various types of graphs. Most of these algorithms have a non-zero
probability of failure. In recent years, there have been some efforts to design
quantum spatial search algorithms with $100\%$ success probability. However,
these works either only work for very special graphs or only for the case where
there is only one marked vertex. In this work, we propose a different and
elegant approach to quantum spatial search, obtaining deterministic quantum
search algorithms that can find a marked vertex with certainty on any Laplacian
integral graph with any predetermined proportion of marked vertices. Thus, this
work discovers the largest class of graphs so far that allow deterministic
quantum search, making it easy to design deterministic quantum search
algorithms for many graphs, including the different graphs discussed in
previous works, in a unified framework.

Abstract: Reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity remains one of the most
profound challenges in modern physics. The BMV (Bose-Marletto-Vedral)
experiment can assess the quantum nature of gravity by testing whether
gravitational interactions can generate entanglement between quantum systems.
In this work, we show that entanglement can be generated by gravity without
requiring spacetime superpositions or quantum spacetime degrees of freedom by
using mediators that do not satisfy the usual property of local tomography when
coupling to quantum matter. Specifically, we showcase how entanglement can be
generated using three distinct toy models that display non-locally tomographic
couplings between quantum matter and a locally classical gravitational
mediator. These models include (i) fermionic systems with the parity
superselection rule, (ii) non-Abelian anyonic systems, and (iii) a novel bit
anti-bit model. Our results demonstrate a crucial point: a gravitational
mediator which does not exhibit superpositions of its classical basis but still
qualifies as non-classical via non-locally tomographic coupling mechanisms can
generate entanglement through local interactions. This work also underscores
the importance of relaxing local tomography in exploring the
quantum-gravitational interface. It provides a novel perspective on the role of
spacetime degrees of freedom in entanglement generation through local
interactions.

Result: 在基准函数上，QAGS比传统方法精度更高，时间和空间复杂度更优。

Conclusion: QAGS通过量子-经典结合的方法，有效提升了全局优化的性能。

Abstract: This work presents Quantum Adaptive Search (QAGS), a hybrid quantum-classical
algorithm for the global optimization of multivariate functions. The method
employs an adaptive mechanism that dynamically narrows the search space based
on a quantum-estimated probability distribution of the objective function. A
quantum state encodes information about solution quality through an appropriate
complex amplitude mapping, enabling the identification of the most promising
regions, and thus progressively tightening the search bounds; then a classical
optimizer performs local refinement of the solution. The analysis demonstrates
that QAGS ensures a contraction of the search space toward global optima, with
controlled computational complexity. The numerical results on the benchmark
functions show that, compared to the classical methods, QAGS achieves higher
accuracy while offering advantages in both time and space complexity.

Conclusion: 结论是QSP与AIM的类比为量子算法实现提供了一种新途径，增强了量子电路的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the
adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast
quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to
perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the
evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We
can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with
nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that
control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$,
frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial
approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy
presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement
the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods have emerged as a promising direction in quantum
machine learning (QML), offering a principled way to map classical data into
high-dimensional quantum Hilbert spaces. While conceptually powerful, designing
effective quantum kernels that adapt to both the target task and the
constraints of near-term quantum hardware remains a nontrivial challenge. In
this work, we propose HaQGNN, a hardware-aware quantum kernel design framework
that integrates quantum device topology, noise characteristics, and graph
neural networks (GNNs) to evaluate and select task-relevant quantum circuits.
By predicting surrogate metrics related to fidelity and kernel performance,
HaQGNN enables efficient circuit screening at scale. Feature selection is
further incorporated to improve compatibility with limited-qubit systems and
mitigate kernel degradation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets,
Credit Card, MNIST-5, and FMNIST-4, demonstrate that HaQGNN outperforms
existing quantum kernel baselines in terms of classification accuracy. Our work
highlights the potential of learning-based and hardware-aware strategies for
advancing practical quantum kernel design on NISQ devices.

Abstract: We study the optical response of a binary system of identical atoms in which
one of them is excited by an incoherent pump. %We study the properties of
photon scattering, absorption and emission, together with the time evolution of
the atomic system. %This allows us to characterize and eventually manipulate
the state of the system, paving the way for prospective applications in quantum
information processing. Applying the diagrammatic formalism developed in
Donaire [Phys. Rev. A104, 043704 (2021)], it is shown how scattering,
absorption, stimulated emission, spontaneous emission and resonant energy
transfer can be tailored by varying i) the interatomic distance, which governs
the interference effects of the emitted radiation; and ii) the pump rate, which
determines the population of the atomic levels. It is found that, for
sufficiently strong pumping, the collective component of the extinction
cross-section becomes negligible, regardless of the interatomic distance, as
optical gains compensate for losses, and the total extinction cross-section is
reduced to less than half of its value in the absence of pumping. In contrast,
at weak pumping and short interatomic distances, interference effects lead to a
significant suppression of the extinction cross-section relative to that of two
noninteracting atoms.

Abstract: We propose a scheme for two-mode hyperradiant lasing in a system comprising
two incoherently pumped quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a bimodal photonic
crystal cavity. To account for the exciton-phonon interactions, we employ a
time-convolutionless polaron-transformed master equation. Both resonant and
off-resonant couplings of the QDs to the cavity modes are considered, and we
analyze the resulting radiance witness as well as the intra- and inter-mode
photon correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phonon-induced
cooperative two-mode two-photon processes significantly enhance the radiance
witness. This enhancement is quantified by evaluating the emission and
absorption rates associated with both single-mode and two-mode two-photon
transitions. Finally, we compare the radiance witness and emission spectral
linewidths for QDs coupled to single-mode and bimodal cavities, revealing that
an increase in radiance witness is accompanied by a narrowing of the emission
linewidth.

Abstract: The incompatibility of quantum measurements, i.e. the fact that certain
observable quantities cannot be measured jointly is widely regarded as a
distinctive quantum feature with important implications for the foundations and
the applications of quantum information theory. While the standard
incompatibility of multiple measurements has been the focus of attention since
the inception of quantum theory, its generalizations, such as measurement
simulability, $n$-wise incompatibility, and mulit-copy incompatibility have
only been proposed recently. Here, we point out that all these generalizations
are differing notions of the question of how many measurements are genuinely
contained in a measurement device. We then show, that all notions do differ not
only in their operational meaning but also mathematically in the set of
measurement assemblages they describe. We then fully resolve the relations
between these different generalizations, by showing a strict hierarchy between
these notions. Hence, we provide a general framework for generalized
measurement incompatibility. Finally, we consider the implications our results
have for recent works using these different notions.

Abstract: In this work, we present analytical solution of Schr\"odinger equation of
confined pseudoharmonic potential in presence of a moving boundary condition,
for an arbitrary angular momentum state. It turns out that an important
quantity to probe the problem is internuclear distance ratio, which depends on
the solution of Ermakov equation. The minimum value of time-dependent (TD)
Heisenberg uncertainty product always remains greater than that of the minimum
uncertainty product h/2. The TD average energy is derived analytically in a
closed form and the corresponding average force and average pressure are
defined. Moreover, time correlation function of two states for the case of six
selected diatomic molecules (CO, NO, ScH, CH, H2, N2) is obtained. It is found
to depend on internuclear distance ratio at two different time domains. The TD
survival probability and average life-time of molecule in a confined quantum
system are defined. Expressions are offered for quantum similarity measure,
dissimilarity and quantum similarity index. The latter is given for a pair of
molecules. The obtained results are compared with available literature,
wherever possible. To our knowledge this is the first detailed report of a
non-harmonic central potential in a TD moving boundary condition.

can not be maximally entangled across every bipartition. Such states are now
known as absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states. Here we give a series of
old and new proofs of the fact that no four-qubit AME state exists. These are
based on invariant theory, methods from coding theory, and basic properties
from linear algebra such as the Pauli commutation relations.

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent, measurement-free optical feedback control of a
levitated nanoparticle, achieving phonon occupations down to a few hundred
phonons. Unlike measurement-based feedback, this all-optical scheme preserves
the correlations between mechanical motion and the feedback signal. Adjustment
of the feedback phase and delay provides precise and tunable control over the
system dynamics. The ultimate cooling performance is currently limited by phase
noise, which we analyze within a theoretical framework that outlines the
constraints and prospects for reaching the motional ground state. Our results
establish coherent feedback as a powerful tool for quantum control of levitated
systems, extending beyond center-of-mass cooling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子态经典描述与经典通信需求之间的关系，特别是相对误差下的通信复杂度，填补了现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过分析相对误差版本的通信问题，证明了新的下界，并扩展到不同任务（如Pauli观测和内积估计）。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了量子态经典描述与通信复杂度之间的深刻联系，为量子学习理论中的经典阴影问题提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We study the question of how much classical communication is needed when
Alice is given a classical description of a quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ for
Bob to recover any expectation value $\langle \psi | M |\psi\rangle$ given an
observable $M$ with $M$ Hermitian and $||M||_{\text{op}} \leq 1$. This task,
whose study was initiated by Raz (ACM 1999) and more recently investigated by
Gosset and Smolin (TQC 2019), can be thought of as a fully classical version of
the pure state case of the well-known classical shadows problem in quantum
learning theory. We show how the hardness of these two seemingly distinct
problems are connected.
  We first consider the relative error version of the communication question
and prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ on the one-way
randomized classical communication, improving upon an additive error lower
bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ as shown by Gosset and Smolin. Notably, we show
that this lower bound holds not only for the set of all observables but also
when restricted to just the class of Pauli observables. This fact implies a
$\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ versus $O(\text{poly}(n))$ separation in the compression
size between the relative and additive error settings for non-adaptive Pauli
classical shadows with classical memory.
  Extending this framework, we prove randomized communication lower bounds for
other relative error one-way classical communication tasks: an
$\Omega(2^{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when instead Alice is given an
observable and Bob is given a quantum state and they are asked to estimate the
expectation value, an $\Omega(\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when
restricted to Paulis, and an $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound
when Alice and Bob are both given quantum states and asked to estimate the
inner product.

Abstract: Simulating nonlinear classical dynamics on a quantum computer is an
inherently challenging task due to the linear operator formulation of quantum
mechanics. In this work, we provide a systematic approach to alleviate this
difficulty by developing a quantum algorithm that implements the time evolution
of a second order time-discretized version of the Lorenz model. The Lorenz
model is a celebrated system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that
has been extensively studied in the contexts of climate science, fluid
dynamics, and chaos theory. Our algorithm possesses a recursive structure and
requires only a linear number of copies of the initial state with respect to
the number of integration time-steps. This provides a significant improvement
over previous approaches, while preserving the characteristic quantum speed-up
in terms of the dimensionality of the underlying differential equations system,
that similar time-marching quantum algorithms have previously demonstrated.
Notably, by classically implementing the proposed algorithm, we showcase that
it accurately captures the structural characteristics of the Lorenz system,
reproducing both regular attractors--limit cycles--and the chaotic attractor
within the chosen parameter regime.

Motivation: 研究如何克服自由基间相互作用和分子运动对SCRPs磁测量性能的负面影响，提升其在量子计量学中的应用。

Method: 利用结构化分子运动调制自由基间相互作用，特别是在隐花色素中的活化学传感器中。

Result: 分子运动不仅提高了磁灵敏度，还使磁场方向估计的精度接近量子Cramér-Rao界限，且在环境噪声和复杂自旋系统中表现更优。

Conclusion: 自然系统中的扰动可能使其更接近量子极限，为分子量子信息技术提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising
platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical
interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings,
alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion,
typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we
show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a
live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and,
more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the
quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance.
Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise
and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that
perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate
closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the
weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the
underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron
spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging
molecular quantum information technologies.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子热力学与开放系统的相互作用提供了新的理论框架，特别是在非平衡条件下的能量转换方面。

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics with open systems is often based on the quantum
optical weak-coupling master equation or on operational repeated interaction
models, whereas early works on thermalisation and on decoherence theory were
mostly concerned with the kinetics of gas collisions. Here we formulate a
master equation for the dynamics of a quantum system under inelastic scattering
with a dilute thermal gas in three dimensions, comprised of ancilla particles
that also possess internal degrees of freedom. We show thermodynamic
consistency when the gas is at thermal equilibrium, irrespective of whether or
not the ancillas are in resonance with the system. In contrast, when the
internal and the motional state of the gas are thermalised to different
temperatures, the gas acts not as two distinct heat baths, but as a structured
non-equilibrium reservoir that can generate useful energy through uncontrolled
collisions.

Conclusion: 反向传播几何结构为集成、高纯度和可调谐光子源提供了新途径，适用于量子光子网络。

Abstract: Quantum photonic technologies rely on the ability to generate, manipulate,
and interfere indistinguishable single photons on a scalable platform. Among
the various approaches, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains
one of the most widely used methods for generating entangled or pure photon
pairs. However most integrated SPDC sources relying on co-propagating
geometries have a limited purity of heralded photons, or require lossy
filtering. Type-2 SPDC processes can produce pure separable photons but
typically suffer from lower efficiency and added complexity due to polarisation
management. Here we show the first integrated counter-propagating photon-pair
source on lithium niobate on insulator, where signal and idler photons are
generated in opposite directions. The counter-propagating geometry leads to
spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs without spectral filtering. The joint
spectral intensity measurements and unheralded $g^{(2)}$ correlations, yield
purities of (92$\pm$3)%. Interference between two independent sources achieves
heralded visibilities of (71$\pm$3)%, confirming the scalability of the
platform. These results establish a new route toward integrated, high-purity,
and tunable photon sources. The demonstrated counter-propagating geometry
offers a scalable solution for quantum photonic networks.

Conclusion: 为高阶时间导数理论提供了一致性重新解释，扩展了构建无鬼量子模型的工具箱。

Abstract: We address the long-standing ``ghost problem" in higher time-derivative
theories (HTDTs), where quantisation typically yields sectors with either
unbounded spectra or non-normalisable eigenstates; both rendering the theory
unphysical. We propose a novel method that preserves the bounded nature of the
spectrum in one particular sector while restoring normalisability by employing
a non-unitary similarity transformation. Inspired by techniques from
pseudo/quasi-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, we construct a
non-unitary map between two Hermitian Hamiltonians, converting ghostly sectors
into physically viable ones. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach
using a concrete HTDT model, related to the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator, and show
that the transformed system admits normalisable eigenstates and a spectrum
bounded from below. This framework offers a consistent re-interpretation of
HTDTs and extends the toolbox for constructing ghost-free quantum models.

Abstract: We put forth a hitherto unexplored control strategy that enables
high-fidelity fast transport of an unstable quantum wavepacket even in the
presence of bath-induced dissipation. The wavepacket, which is confined within
any shallow (anharmonic) potential trap is steered in acceleration, so as to
maximize the transfer fidelity. This strategy can generally optimize any
non-Markovian bath-dressed continuous-variable system dynamics. It can
simultaneously cope with wavepacket leakage via non-adiabatic transitions and
bath-induced dissipation in an optimal fashion. It can outperform methods based
on counterdiabatic fields (shortcuts to adiabaticity) particularly for fast
non-adiabatic transport. Transport fidelity is maximized even for trajectories
exceeding the speed of bath-excitation propagation, e.g. for supersonic
transfer through phonon baths. This general approach is illustrated for
optimized transfer of impurities in Bose-Einstein condensates. It is applicable
to both dissipative and non-dissipative transfer of trapped atoms and ions and
molecular reaction products.

Abstract: Phase transitions governed by topological defects constitute a cornerstone of
modern physics. Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry
classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a
mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in
the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional
(3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological
defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation
of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a
mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak
band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation
of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the
magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and
quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a
unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and
mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an
external magnetic field, respectively.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of homogeneous
ultracold Bose gases of microwave-shielded polar molecules following a sudden
quench of the scattering length at zero temperature. We calculate in particular
the quantum depletion, the anomalous density, the condensate fluctuations, and
the pair correlation function using both the time-dependent Bogoliubov approach
and the self-consistent time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation.
During their time evolution, these quantities exhibit slow or fast oscillations
depending on the strength of the shielding interactions. We find that at long
time scales the molecular condensate is characterized by nonequilibrium
steady-state momentum distribution functions, with depletion, anomalous density
and correlations that deviate from their corresponding equilibrium values. We
demonstrate that the pair correlations expand diffusively at short times while
they spread ballistically at long times.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate equal-mass spin-balanced two-component Fermi
gases in which pairs of atoms with opposite spins interact via a short-range
isotropic model potential. We probe the distinction between two-dimensional and
quasi-two-dimensional harmonic confinement by tuning the effective range
parameter within two-dimensional scattering theory. Our approach, which yields
numerically exact energetic and structural properties, combines a correlated
Gaussian basis-set expansion with the stochastic variational method. For
systems containing up to six particles, we: 1) Present the ground- and
excited-state energy spectra; 2) Study non-local correlations by analysing the
one- and two-body density matrices, extracting from these the occupation
numbers of the natural orbitals, the momentum distributions of atoms and pairs,
and the molecular 'condensate fraction'; 3) Study local correlations by
computing the radial and pair distribution functions. This paper extends
current theoretical knowledge on the properties of trapped few-fermion systems
as realised in state-of-the-art cold-atom experiments.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the ground state and dynamics of a Rabi-coupled
pseudospin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate, where only one spin component is
subjected to an external potential. We show that in the quasiperiodic potential
the Rabi coupling induces localization between the components as it is raised
above the threshold value. Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced
by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic
trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction
with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate
dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where
various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double
(triple)-minima, tree-(parquet)-like, and frozen distributions with a
correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the
condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass

Result: 观察到超流体相（长程相位相干）和莫特绝缘体相（局域原子数固定，无相位相干）之间的可逆相变。

Conclusion: 量子涨落可诱导宏观相变，为研究量子多体系统的基态行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are
frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum
fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a
many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is
varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition
in a Bose-Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a
three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the
lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott
insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the
entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase,
exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase
coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the
excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground
states of the system.

Abstract: We study the formation of bound states in a binary mixture of a few bosons in
square optical lattices. Using the exact diagonalization method, we find that
bound clusters of all available bosons can form. We provide a comprehensive
numerical examination of these bound states for a wide range of repulsive
intraspecies and attractive interspecies interactions. In contrast to binary
mixtures in one-dimensional chains, we reveal that the binding energy of the
clusters shows a non-monotonic dependence on the interspecies interaction
strengths for small tunneling rates, developing a local minimum for
intermediate attractive interactions. The findings of this work highlight the
difference between the binding mechanisms of binary bosonic mixtures in one-
and higher-dimensional lattices.

Conclusion: 共同随机扩散率导致布朗粒子气体表现出动态相关性和复杂的统计行为，FCS在时间上呈现有趣的转变。

Abstract: We study a gas of $N$ Brownian particles in the presence of a common
stochastic diffusivity $D(t)=B^2(t)$, where $B(t)$ represents a one-dimensional
Brownian motion at time $t$. Starting with all the particles from the origin,
the gas expands ballistically. We show that because of the common stochastic
diffusivity, the expanding gas gets dynamically correlated, and the joint
probability density function of the position of the particles has a
conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure that was
recently found in several other systems. The special CIID structure allows us
to compute the average density profile of the gas, extreme and order
statistics, gap distribution between successive particles, and the full
counting statistics (FCS) that describes the probability density function (PDF)
$H(\kappa, t)$ of the fraction of particles $\kappa$ in a given region
$[-L,L]$. Interestingly, the position fluctuation of the central particles and
the average density profiles are described by the same scaling function. The
PDF describing the FCS has an essential singularity near $\kappa=0$, indicating
the presence of particles inside the box $[-L,L]$ at all times. Near the upper
limit $\kappa =1$, the scaling function $H(\kappa,t)$ has a rather unusual
behavior: $H(\kappa,t)\sim (1-\kappa)^{\beta(t)}$ where the exponent $\beta(t)$
changes continuously with time. While at early times $\beta(t)<0$ indicating a
divergence of $H(\kappa,t)$ as $\kappa\to 1$, $\beta(t)$ becomes positive for
$t>t_c$ where $t_c$ is computed exactly. For $t>t_c$, the scaling function
$H(\kappa,t)$ vanishes as $\kappa\to 1$, indicating that it is highly unlikely
to have all the particles in the interval $[-L,L]$. Exactly at $t=t_c$,
$\beta=0$, indicating that the PDF approaches a non-zero constant as $\kappa\to
1$. Thus, as a function of $t$, the FCS exhibits an interesting shape
transition.

Method: 构建三角形几何分子模型，开发‘翻转’蒙特卡洛算法，加速平衡和采样。

Result: 算法在实验玻璃化温度下采样速度提升约10^9倍，发现玻璃脆性和Stokes-Einstein关系的偏离更接近实验观察。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到多种分子几何结构，为理解分子细节对玻璃化转变的普遍物理特性的影响提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to study numerically the glass transition of
molecular fluids. Our approach combines the construction of simple yet
realistic models with the development of Monte Carlo algorithms to accelerate
equilibration and sampling. Inspired by the well-studied ortho-terphenyl
glass-former, we construct a molecular model with an analogous triangular
geometry and construct a `flip' Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate that the
flip Monte Carlo algorithm achieves a sampling speedup of about $10^9$ at the
experimental glass transition temperature $T_g$. This allows us to
systematically analyze the equilibrium structure and molecular dynamics of the
model over a temperature regime previously inaccessible. We carefully compare
the observed physical behavior to earlier studies that used atomistic models.
In particular, we find that the glass fragility and the departure from the
Stokes-Einstein relation are much closer to experimental observations. We
characterize the development and temperature evolution of spatial correlations
in the relaxation dynamics, using both orientational and translational degrees
of freedom. Excess wings emerge at intermediate frequencies in dynamic
rotational spectra, and we directly visualize the corresponding molecular
motion near $T_g$. Our approach can be generalized to a number of molecular
geometries and paves the way to a complete understanding of how molecular
details may affect more universal physical aspects characterizing molecular
liquids approaching their glass transition.

Result: 发现传递熵与平均影响之间的定量关系，并验证基于内在互信息的分解方法最合适。

Conclusion: 为复杂系统中影响与信息的定量研究提供了模型系统。

Abstract: While information-theoretic quantities, such as transfer entropy, have been
widely adopted to infer causal relationships in collective systems, a critical
gap exists: the absence of quantitative evidence directly linking
information-theoretic quantities to a physically defined influence. This letter
addresses this gap by proposing a modified Vicsek model that enables the
calculation of a physically interpretable influence grounded in the angular
interactions between particles. Averaged pairwise influences can serve as new
order parameters to indicate collective phase transitions. We reveal
quantitative relations between information, represented by transfer entropy,
and average influence in pairwise and collective interactions. We test three
typical methods of partial information decomposition and find that the method
based on intrinsic mutual information gives the most appropriate
interpretation. Overall, this work provides a model system for quantitative
studies of influence and information in complex systems.

Abstract: In this work we introduce a field theory capable of describing the critical
properties of nonideal systems undergoing continuous phase transitions beyond
the leading order radiative corrections or in the number of loops (effective
field theories limited only to leading order were recently defined in
literature). These systems present defects, inhomogeneities and impurities as
opposed to ideal ones which are perfect, homogeneous and pure. We compute the
values of the critical exponents of the theory beyond leading order and compare
with their corresponding experimental measured results. The results show some
interplay between nonideal effects and fluctuations.

Result: 发现一维系统中通过临界波动可实现长程有序，且Goldstone模式在红外区域仍保持相互作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明一维系统中连续对称性破坏比传统理论预期的更容易，Berry相位是传统直觉失效的原因。

Abstract: We argue that ground states of 1D spin chains can spontaneously break U(1)
``easy-plane'' spin rotation symmetry, via true long-range order of $(S^x,
S^y)$, at the phase transition between two quasi-long-range-ordered phases. The
critical point can be reached by tuning a single parameter in a Hamiltonian
with the same symmetry as the XXZ model, without further fine-tuning.
Equivalently, it can arise in systems of bosons with particle-hole symmetry, as
a long-range-ordered transition point between two quasi-long-range-ordered
superfluids. Our approach is to start with the continuum field theory of the
isotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet and consider generic perturbations that
respect easy-plane symmetry. We argue for a renormalization-group flow to a
critical point where long-range order in $(S^x, S^y)$ is enabled by coexisting
critical fluctuations of $S^z$. (We also discuss multicritical points where
further parameters are tuned to zero.) These results show that it is much
easier to break continuous symmetries in 1D than standard lore would suggest.
The failure of standard intuition for 1D chains (based on the
quantum--classical correspondence) can be attributed to Berry phases, which
prevent the 1+1D system from mapping to a classical 2D spin model. The present
theory also gives an example of an ordered state whose Goldstone mode is
interacting even in the infra-red, rather than becoming a free field.

Conclusion: 两圈修正表明临界费米子数Nf,c2显著降低，为Gross-Neveu模型的相变行为提供了更精确的描述。

Abstract: We study the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theory for the SO($N$) symmetric
traceless rank-two tensor order parameter coupled to Majorana fermions using
the $\epsilon$-expansion around upper critical dimensions of $3+1$ to two
loops. Previously we established in the one-loop calculation that the theory
does not exhibit a critical fixed point for $N \geq 4$, but that nevertheless
the stable fixed point inevitably emerges at a large number of fermion flavors
$N_f$. For $N_f < N_{f,c1} \approx N/2$, no critical fixed point exists; for
$N_{f,c1} < N_f < N_{f,c2}$, a real critical fixed point emerges from the
complex plane but fails to satisfy the additional stability conditions
necessary for a continuous phase transition; and finally only for $N_f >
N_{f,c2} \approx N$, the fixed point satisfies the stability conditions as
well. In the present work we compute the $O(\epsilon)$ (two-loop) corrections
to the critical flavour numbers $N_{f,c1} $ and $N_{f,c2}$. Most importantly,
we observe a sharp decrease in $N_{f,c2}$ from its one-loop value, which brings
it closer to the point $N_f =1$ relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model.
Some three-loop results are also presented and discussed.

spins hinders the formation of a quantum Hall ferromagnet, instead favouring
other phases. We study the phase diagram in dependence on different short-range
Haldane pseudopotentials $V_m$ and uncover several phases: A fractional
topological insulator, a phase separated state, a spin-polarized fractional
quantum Hall state, and the partially particle-hole transformed Halperin (111)
state. The effect of the pseudopotentials $V_m$ depends on the parity of $m$,
the relative angular momentum.

Conclusion: 玻色化理论成功解决了2d费米液体中的dHvA效应问题，并揭示了其与3d费米液体的差异。

Abstract: The de Haas-van Alphen effect (dHvA) of a 2d Fermi liquid remains poorly
understood, due to the $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$ contribution to the oscillations of
grand potential from the oscillatory part of the fermionic self energy, which
has no known closed-form solution. In this work, we solve this problem via
coadjoint-orbit bosonization of the Fermi surface. Compared with the fermionic
formalism, the issue of the oscillatory self energy is circumvented. As an
effective field theory, Landau parameters $F_{n}$ directly enter the theory. We
use the bosonized theory to derive the energies of cyclotron resonance and
specific heat, which are consistent with Fermi liquid theory. Via a mode
expansion, we show that the problem of dHvA is reduced to 0+1D quantum
mechanics. We obtain analytic expressions for the behavior of dHvA at low and
high temperatures, which deviate from the well-known Lifshitz-Kosevich formula.
We contrast this behavior with that of 3d Fermi liquids, for which we show such
deviations are parametrically small. We discuss the effects of disorder on dHvA
within the bosonized theory.

Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a distinct and fundamental class of
magnetic order. Exploring its interplay with quantum phenomena such as
unconventional superconductivity, density-wave instabilities, and many-body
effects represents a compelling frontier. In this work, we theoretically
confirm the presence of high-temperature metallic altermagnetism in
KV$_2$Se$_2$O. We demonstrate that the anomalous metal-insulator-metal
transition arises from a Lifshitz transition associated with Fermi surface
reconstruction. The previously reported spin-density wave gap is found to lie
below the Fermi level in our study and is now recognized to be attributed to
the V-shaped density of states, originating from orbital-selective and
sublattice-resolved half-metal-like behavior on a specific V atom. Furthermore,
we identify the instability from the nesting of spin-momentum-locked
two-dimensional Fermi surfaces, which induces the SDW state. These findings
position KV$_2$Se$_2$O as a promising platform for investigating the interplay
among altermagnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and density-wave order.

Abstract: The face-centered-cubic lattice is composed of edge-sharing tetrahedra,
making it a leading candidate host for strongly frustrated magnetism, but
relatively few face-centered frustrated materials have been investigated. In
the hydroxide double perovskite \cusnoh, magnetic frustration of the Cu$^{2+}$
quantum spins is partially relieved by strong Jahn-Teller distortions.
Nevertheless, the system shows no signs of long-range magnetic order down to
45\,mK and instead exhibits broad thermodynamic anomalies in specific heat and
magnetization, indicating short-range dynamical spin correlations\, -- \,a
behavior typical of quantum spin liquids. We propose that such an unusual
robustness of the spin-liquid-like state is a combined effect of quantum
fluctuations of the quantum spins $S=\frac{1}{2}$, residual frustration on the
highly distorted face-centered Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice, and correlated proton
disorder. Similar to the disorder-induced spin-liquid mimicry in YbMgGaO$_4$
and herbertsmithite, proton disorder destabilizes the long-range magnetic order
by introducing randomness into the magnetic exchange interaction network.
However, unlike the quenched substitutional disorder on the magnetic
sublattice, which is difficult to control, proton disorder can in principle be
tuned through pressure-driven proton ordering transitions. This opens up the
prospect of tuning the degree of disorder in a magnetic system to better
understand its influence on the magnetic ground state.

Abstract: We study nonsymmorphic space group symmetry breakings in correlated electron
systems. Under nonsymmorphic symmetry, it is well known that there are
degeneracies in the electronic Bloch states at the Brillouin zone boundaries.
When the system undergoes a phase transition into an ordered phase with
breaking the nonsymmorphic symmetry, the degeneracy is lifted. This happens
even when the order parameter is uniform. We point out that this general
feature leads to various {\it uniform} Peierls transition in nonsymmorphic
systems. In particular, we show that such mechanism of the Peierls gap
formation can be realized accompanying with uniform anisotropic Kondo singlet
formations. This explains the hidden electric order observed in CeCoSi.

Abstract: PdTe$_2$ is a type II Dirac semimetal that has garnered significant attention
due to its intriguing electronic and topological properties. Here, we report
temperature dependent Raman scattering study of PdTe$_2$ in the temperature
range from 10 K to 300 K. Our study reveals emergence of a new unreported peak
below 100 K, centered around 250 cm$^{-1}$. We argue that the new mode is not a
phonon mode because the Raman spectra calculated using Density Functional
Theory shows only two intense peaks at 85 $ cm^{-1}$ and 128 $cm^{-1}$. To
ascertain the origin of this new peak, we constructed a microscopic model of
electrons coupling to a single plasmon mode at 250 $cm^{-1}$ and using the
memory function formalism, we obtained that the Raman relaxation rate is linear
in frequency. We also performed phenomenological analysis of the Raman response
from the experimental data and computed frequency dependent Raman relaxation
rate, which is also found to exhibit a linear dependence on frequency. With the
congruence of our theoretical and phenomenological results we could ascertain
that the new mode observed at low temperatures is indeed a plasmon-like mode.
Further, phonon frequencies and line widths of the two phonon modes exhibit
anomalous behavior above 100 K.

for autocorrelations of the homogeneous Floquet-Ising model as well as the
$Z_3$ clock model. The numerically obtained Krylov angles of the $Z_3$ clock
model with long-lived period tripled autocorrelations show a spatial
periodicity of six, and this observation is used to develop an analytically
solvable model for the ITFIM that mimics this behavior.
