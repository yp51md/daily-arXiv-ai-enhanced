Unfortunately, the currently available Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware is still heavily affected by noise.\nMany optimization techniques have been developed to reduce the negative effects\nthereof, which, however, only works up to a certain point. Therefore, scaling\nquantum applications from currently considered small research examples to\nindustrial applications requires error-correction techniques to execute quantum\ncircuits in a fault-tolerant fashion and enter the Fault-Tolerant Quantum\nComputing (FTQC) era. These error-correction techniques introduce dramatic\nqubit overheads, leading to the requirement of tens of thousands of qubits\nalready for toy-sized examples. Hence, quantum circuit optimization that\nreduces qubit overheads when shifting from the NISQ to the FTQC era is\nessential.

Hence, quantum error correction becomes essential but induces\nsignificant overheads in qubits and execution time, often by orders of\nmagnitude. Obviously, these overheads must be reduced. Since many quantum\napplications can tolerate some noise, end users can provide a maximum tolerated\nerror, the error budget, to be considered during compilation and execution.\nThis error budget, or, more precisely, its distribution, can be a key factor in\nachieving the overhead reduction. Conceptually, an error-corrected quantum\ncircuit can be divided into different parts that each have a specific purpose.\nErrors can happen in any of these parts and their errors sum up to the\nmentioned error budget, but how to distribute it among them actually\nconstitutes a degree of freedom. This work is based on the idea that some of\nthe circuit parts can compensate for errors more efficiently than others.\nConsequently, these parts should contribute more to satisfy the total error\nbudget than the parts where it is more costly. However, this poses the\nchallenge of finding optimal distributions. We address this challenge not only\nby providing general guidelines on distributing the error budget, but also a\nmethod that automatically determines resource-efficient distributions for\narbitrary circuits by training a machine learning model on an accumulated\ndataset. The approach is evaluated by analyzing the machine learning model's\npredictions on so far unseen data, reducing the estimated space-time costs for\nmore than 75% of the considered quantum circuits, with an average reduction of\n15.6%, including cases without improvement, and a maximum reduction of 77.7%."}

Here, using atomistic\nsimulations of hexadecane confined by structured silica substrates, we reveal\nhow interfacial geometry, specifically curvature, governs the density\ndistribution and thermal transport across the interface. At flat and mildly\ncurved surfaces, the liquid exhibits surface-templated layering, promoting\nefficient heat transfer, which is enhanced with increasing contact surface\narea. As curvature increases, this ordering breaks down, giving rise to\ninterference-like density patterns, reduced molecular packing, and localized\ndepletion zones. This structural reorganization leads to a systematic increase\nin interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), even when the contact area is kept\nconstant. By decomposing the interface into convex (\"hill\" of solid) and\nconcave (\"valley\" of solid) regions, we find that valleys consistently offer\nlower thermal resistance. In contrast, hills act as bottlenecks to heat flow.\nRemarkably, we show that the work of adhesion and entropy-related energy losses\nscale non-trivially with curvature: while adhesion increases with contact area,\nthe entropic penalty dominates the total energy change, reflecting\ncurvature-induced frustration of molecular alignment.

Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often\nrequires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance\nfor quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main\nchallenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum\nbugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and\nsupplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their\ncontext, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While\nclassifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged\ndue to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or\nworkflow.
