Gaining insight into how these landscapes interact with\ngradient-based optimization methods, even in relatively simple models, can shed\nlight on this enigmatic feature of neural networks. In this work, we will focus\non a prototypical simple learning problem, which generalizes the Phase\nRetrieval inference problem by allowing the exploration of overparametrized\nsettings. Using techniques from field theory, we analyze the spectrum of the\nHessian at initialization and identify a Baik-Ben Arous-P\\'ech\\'e (BBP)\ntransition in the amount of data that separates regimes where the\ninitialization is informative or uninformative about a planted signal of a\nteacher-student setup. Crucially, we demonstrate how overparameterization can\nbend the loss landscape, shifting the transition point, even reaching the\ninformation-theoretic weak-recovery threshold in the large overparameterization\nlimit, while also altering its qualitative nature. We distinguish between\ncontinuous and discontinuous BBP transitions and support our analytical\npredictions with simulations, examining how they compare to the finite-N\nbehavior. In the case of discontinuous BBP transitions strong finite-N\ncorrections allow the retrieval of information at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nsmaller than the predicted BBP transition. In these cases we provide estimates\nfor a new lower SNR threshold that marks the point at which initialization\nbecomes entirely uninformative."}

They are expected to\nplay a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the\ndevelopment of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their\nstatistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field\ndisordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission\namplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply\nit to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier,\nwhich formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the\ninfluence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators,\nwe identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading\nin Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by\nrare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase\nwhere such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size\nphase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the\nAnderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based\non real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even\ninfinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite\ndisorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction\nstrengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space\ngraph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral\nprobes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes\nstems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and\nshorter-ranged deep in the localized phase."}

Here, we demonstrate\nthe use of nonlinear transport as a complementary approach to uncover hidden\ncrystal symmetries, using the strongly correlated Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a case\nstudy. Below 48 K (T$_S$), where the magnetic moments of the antiferromagnetic\nphase reorient from the a- to the b-axis, leading to a pseudogap opening, our\nmeasurements, with support of DFT, reveal a previously overlooked\nlower-symmetry phase.

This\nresponse also suggests a transformation from a conventional antiferromagnet\ninto an altermagnet. The lower-symmetry phase arises from a subtle lattice\ndistortion (~0.1 pm) associated with the magnetic transition at T$_S$, below\nthe detection limit of conventional diffraction.

This effect can be achieved for skyrmions moving in a\nchannel with a sawtooth potential on one side and a reversed sawtooth potential\non the other side. We consider the cases of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and\nspin-orbit torque (SOT) driving. When the magnetic field is held fixed, the\nvelocity response of the skyrmion is the same for current applied in either\ndirection for both STT and SOT driving, so there is no current diode effect.\nWhen the magnetic field is reversed, under STT driving the velocity of the\nskyrmion reverses and its absolute value changes. Under SOT driving, the\nvelocity remains in the same direction but drops to a much lower value,\nresulting in negative differential conductivity. For a fixed current, we find a\nnonreciprocal skyrmion velocity as a function of positive and negative applied\nfields, in analogy to the velocity-current curves observed in the usual diode\neffect. The nonreciprocity is generated by the Magnus force, which causes\nskyrmions to interact preferentially with one side of the channel. Since the\nchannel sides have opposite asymmetry, a positive magnetic field can cause the\nskyrmion to interact with the \"hard\" asymmetry side of the channel, while a\nnegative magnetic field causes the skyrmion to interact with the easy asymmetry\nside. This geometry could be used to create new kinds of magnetic-field-induced\ndiode effects that can be harnessed in new types of skyrmion-based devices."}

They are expected to\nplay a prominent role in the stability of the MBL phase, prompting the\ndevelopment of new theoretical frameworks to properly account for their\nstatistical weight. We employ a method based on an analogy with mean-field\ndisordered glassy systems to characterize the statistics of transmission\namplitudes between distant many-body configurations in Hilbert space, and apply\nit to the random-field XXZ spin chain. By introducing a Lagrange multiplier,\nwhich formally plays the role of an effective temperature controlling the\ninfluence of extreme outliers in the heavy-tailed distribution of propagators,\nwe identify three distinct regimes: (i) an ergodic phase with uniform spreading\nin Hilbert space, (ii) an intermediate regime where delocalization is driven by\nrare, disorder-dependent long-range resonances, and (iii) a robust MBL phase\nwhere such resonances cannot destabilize localization. We derive a finite-size\nphase diagram in the disorder--interaction plane both in the spin and in the\nAnderson basis that quantitatively agrees with recent numerical results based\non real-space spin-spin correlation functions. We further demonstrate that even\ninfinitesimal interactions can destroy the Anderson insulator at finite\ndisorder, with the critical disorder remaining finite down to small interaction\nstrengths. By visualizing resonant transmission pathways on the Hilbert space\ngraph, we provide a complementary perspective to real-space and spectral\nprobes, revealing how the destabilization of the MBL phase at finite sizes\nstems from the emergence of resonant paths that become progressively rarer and\nshorter-ranged deep in the localized phase."}

Recently\nuncovered spatially modulated symmetries, whose actions vary with position,\nenable excitations with restricted mobility, while Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM)\ntype anomalies impose sharp constraints on which lattice phases are realizable.\nIn one dimensional a spin chain, gauging procedures have linked modulated\nsymmetry to LSM type anomaly, but a general understanding beyond 1D remains\nincomplete. We show that spatially modulated symmetries and their associated\ndipole algebras naturally emerge from gauging ordinary symmetries in the\npresence of generalized LSM type anomalies. We construct explicit lattice\nmodels in two and three spatial dimensions and develop complementary field\ntheoretic descriptions in arbitrary spatial dimensions that connect LSM anomaly\ninflow to higher-group symmetry structures governing the modulated symmetries.\nOur results provide a unified, nonperturbative framework that ties together LSM\nconstraints and spatially modulated symmetries across dimensions."}

Here we apply radio-frequency (RF) excitation to this coupled system\nand use the three-dimensional distribution of emitted positrons to reconstruct\nthe time-dependent evolution of the muon spin polarization. This\nthree-dimensional readout, using single spin detection, is not possible in a\nsingle NMR experiment and demonstrates significant advantages that are achieved\nby using RF muon techniques. We demonstrate the application of this\nvector-readout method to the experimental observation of a muon spin echo\nsignal that is controlled by the dipolar coupling to fluorine, as well as to a\ndouble resonance experiment, in which we use pulses tuned to separate\nfrequencies to address both the muon and fluorine spins. This targeted\napproach, in which selective RF pulses can control the muon spin and other\nspins to which it is coupled, provides a novel route for probing systems of\nentangled spins."}
