As the potential depth of the\nlattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott\ninsulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the\nentire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase,\nexact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase\ncoherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the\nexcitation spectrum.

The worldline of a free\nelectron is revealed by applying Dirac's velocity operator to its wave function\nwhose space-time arguments are expressed in a proper time by a Lorentz\ntransformation. This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the electron's\nglobal motion of its inertia (or spin) center and an inherent local periodic\nmotion about this point that produces the electron's spin. The latter has the\nultra-high ZBW (zitterbewegung) frequency $\\omega_0$ found by Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nin his operator analysis of Dirac's equation and so is appropriately called the\n\\emph{zitter motion}. The decomposition corresponds to Gordon's decomposition\nof Dirac's current where the so-called polarization and magnetization currents\nare due to the zitter motion. In an inertial \"rest\"-frame fixed at the inertia\ncenter, Dirac's wave function corresponding to the electron spin in a specified\ndirection implies that a free electron of mass $m$ moves in an inherent\nperpetual zitter motion at the speed of light $c$ in a circle of radius\n$c/\\omega_0 = \\hbar /(2mc)$ about the inertia center in a plane orthogonal to\nthis spin direction.
