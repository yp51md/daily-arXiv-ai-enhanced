### [1] [Spectral Bias in Variational Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22555)
*Callum Duffy,Marcin Jastrzebski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了量子机器学习中的频谱偏差现象，发现参数化量子电路（PQCs）中的频谱偏差源于傅里叶系数的冗余性，且梯度大小与冗余性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子机器学习中频谱偏差的成因及其对训练的影响。

Method: 利用PQCs的傅里叶级数表示，分析傅里叶系数的冗余性及其与梯度的关系，并通过三种编码方案进行实证研究。

Result: 发现冗余性高的PQCs对参数扰动更具鲁棒性，且大初始化参数和低纠缠结构会减缓收敛速度。

Conclusion: PQCs的频谱偏差与傅里叶系数的冗余性密切相关，设计选择对学习效果有显著影响。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum
machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit
low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than
high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence.
We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs).
Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that
spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier
coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the
model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding
scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find
that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training
strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further
demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes.
Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit
increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the
corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability
of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and
entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement
schemes tend to slow convergence.

### [2] [Vortex Detection from Quantum Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23976)
*Chelsea A. Williams,Annie E. Paine,Antonio A. Gentile,Daniel Berger,Oleksandr Kyriienko*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于从量子数据中提取信息的工具箱，专注于量子涡旋检测（QVD），通过滑动窗口和量子傅里叶分析分离流场中的涡旋特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 成功分离涡旋特征，分类无涡旋解和Lamb-Oseen涡旋数据集。

Conclusion: 展示了从量子数据中高效提取价值的成功案例，强调开发适合量子数据分析工具的必要性。

Abstract: Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data -- states
that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are
difficult to analyze. We propose a toolbox for reading out information from
such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of
flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex
detection (QVD), where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant
features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on
sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between
patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how
contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially,
providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second,
we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from
different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the
entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the
flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions
against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful
case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data and points to the need
for developing appropriate quantum data analysis tools that can be trained on
them.

### [3] [Metric formalism for precision assessment in non-Hermitian systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22571)
*Javid Naikoo,Ravindra W. Chhajlany,Jan Kołodyński,Adam Miranowicz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究比较了非厄米量子系统中量子Fisher信息（QFI）的两种解释方法，指出基于度量的方法更稳定可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升量子系统的测量精度对量子传感和通信技术至关重要，传统QFI方法在非厄米系统中存在局限性。

Method: 研究了非厄米量子动力学的归一化和度量两种解释方法，并通过量子比特系统验证QFI动态。

Result: 归一化方法高估了QFI的增强和恢复，而度量方法提供了更稳定和保守的精度评估。

Conclusion: 度量方法更适合量子计量学，能更准确地评估测量灵敏度，无需后选择。

Abstract: Enhancing measurement precision in quantum systems is vital for advancing
technologies like quantum sensing and communication. Traditionally, quantum
Fisher information (QFI) has been the key tool in determining precision limits
within Hermitian quantum systems. However, recent research has expanded to
non-Hermitian systems exhibiting real spectra. This study investigates various
interpretations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics such as the normalization and
metric approaches. We demonstrate that owing to distinct types of dynamic
behaviour, QFI expressions vary significantly depending on the formalism. In
particular, the normalization formalism overestimates the enhancement and/or
revivals in QFI, effectively post-selecting the most optimistic case of the
evolution, which may give an overly favourable impression of the sensitivity
and accuracy of quantum measurements. The metric-based interpretation maintains
consistency with a Hermitian-like structure, offering a more stable and
conservative assessment of measurement precision. This approach provides a more
natural representation of the system's evolution, enabling a more accurate
assessment of quantum measurement sensitivity without the need for
post-selection. We support our claims by focussing on QFI dynamics for a qubit
system, while advocating the metric interpretation as a more reliable guide for
quantum metrology despite presenting both approaches as valid and complementary
ways of understanding non-Hermitian dynamics.

Conclusion: 该量子通道模型为模拟自旋-运动耦合动力学提供了高效工具，适用于近期的实验研究。

Abstract: We introduce a quantum channel to model the dissipative dynamics resulting
from the coupling between spin and motional degrees of freedom in chains of
neutral atoms with Rydberg interactions. The quantum channel acts on the
reduced spin state obtained under the frozen gas approximation, modulating its
elements with time-dependent coefficients. These coefficients can be computed
exactly in the perturbative regime, enabling efficient modeling of spin-motion
dephasing in systems too large for exact methods. We benchmark the accuracy of
our approach against exact diagonalization for small systems, identifying its
regime of validity and the onset of perturbative breakdown. We then apply the
quantum channel to compute fidelity loss during transport of single-spin
excitations across extended Rydberg chains in regimes intractable via exact
diagonalization. By revealing the quantum-classical crossover, these results
establish a bound on the maximum chain length for efficient entanglement
distribution. The quantum channel significantly reduces the complexity of
simulating spin dynamics coupled to motional degrees of freedom, providing a
practical tool for estimating the impact of spin-motion coupling in near-term
experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.

Result: 在8个物理量子比特上实现了3个逻辑量子比特的容错通用门集，并成功运行了Grover搜索算法。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了无测量量子计算的可行性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The ability to perform quantum error correction (QEC) and robust gate
operations on encoded qubits opens the door to demonstrations of quantum
algorithms. Contemporary QEC schemes typically require mid-circuit measurements
with feed-forward control, which are challenging for qubit control, often slow,
and susceptible to relatively high error rates. In this work, we propose and
experimentally demonstrate a universal toolbox of fault-tolerant logical
operations without mid-circuit measurements on a trapped-ion quantum processor.
We present modular logical state teleportation between two four-qubit
error-detecting codes without measurements during algorithm execution.
Moreover, we realize a fault-tolerant universal gate set on an eight-qubit
error-detecting code hosting three logical qubits, based on state injection,
which can be executed by coherent gate operations only. We apply this toolbox
to experimentally realize Grover's quantum search algorithm fault-tolerantly on
three logical qubits encoded in eight physical qubits, with the implementation
displaying clear identification of the desired solution states. Our work
demonstrates the practical feasibility and provides first steps into the
largely unexplored direction of measurement-free quantum computation.

Conclusion: 该技术为电路量子电动力学（circuit QED）提供了一种新的测量工具，适用于现有和未来的量子比特平台。

Abstract: Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are extremely sensitive
detectors of the complex impedance of materials and devices coupled to them.
This capability has been used to measure losses in multiple different materials
and, in the case of circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), has been
used to measure the coherent evolution of multiple different types of qubits.
Here, we report on the implementation of a scanning resonator for probing
quantum coherent devices. Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling
to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting
resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in
the single-photon regime to be > 10000 and demonstrate capacitive imaging using
our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at
milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy
spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip
readout circuitry. Our work introduces a new tool for using circuit QED to
measure existing and proposed qubit platforms.

### [7] [Scaling Laws of Quantum Information Lifetime in Monitored Quantum Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22755)
*Bingzhi Zhang,Fangjun Hu,Runzhe Mo,Tianyang Chen,Hakan E. Türeci,Quntao Zhuang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子信息在环境连续监测下，其寿命可随系统规模呈指数增长，而无需考虑环境规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子信息在环境监测下的稳定性，探索其寿命与系统规模的关系。

Method: 通过分析典型Haar随机酉矩阵和数值模拟混沌哈密顿系统，验证指数增长现象。

Result: 在环境监测下，寿命呈指数增长；无监测时，寿命增长至多线性或恒定。

Conclusion: 研究结果对量子算法、量子通信及实验实现具有重要启示。

Abstract: Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental
coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with
system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit
measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled
state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for
typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in
both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath
monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at
most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely
with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of
initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the
weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and
quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate
the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via
noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.

### [8] [Lamb-Dicke Dynamics of Interacting Rydberg Atoms Coupled to the Motion of an Optical Tweezer Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22669)

Conclusion: 光学镊子的相干运动对里德堡原子的集体动力学有显著影响，可用于量子模拟和计算。

Abstract: Neutral Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays provide a platform
for quantum simulation and computation. In this work, we investigate the
Lamb-Dicke dynamics of coupled Rydberg atoms for different trapping
frequencies. We model the atomic motion by both internal and motional degrees
of freedom, in which the motional states arise due to the oscillation of each
atom in optical tweezer traps due to the light-atom interaction. In this setup,
the internal states are coupled to a laser light with a Rabi frequency, while
each internal state of each atom is also harmonically trapped with a trap
frequency that depends on the internal state. The impact of the coherent motion
of the optical tweezers on the collective dynamics of the many-body Rydberg
atoms is explored for varying Lamb-Dicke parameters and with different trap
frequencies. We see the occurrence of dynamical phases e.g., Rabi oscillations
in the decoupled limit, the limit torus phase for magic trapping, and the limit
cycle phase as the trap frequency is further increased.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索准精确可解势的局域性质及其随参数λ的变化，特别是隧穿和对称性破缺现象。

Method: 构造满足对称性和渐近行为的变分波函数，计算变分能量并与精确解比较，利用熵度量分析隧穿和对称性。

Result: 变分波函数与精确解吻合度高，熵度量比方差方法更能揭示隧穿和对称性破缺。

Conclusion: 熵度量是研究量子态隧穿和对称性的有效工具，变分波函数质量高。

Abstract: We analyze the (de)localization properties of a quasi-exactly solvable (QES)
sextic potential $V_{\text{QES}}(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x^6 + 2x^4 - 2(2\lambda +
1)x^2)$ as a function of the tunable parameter $\lambda \in [-\frac{3}{4}, 6]$.
For $\lambda > -\frac{1}{2}$, the potential exhibits a symmetric double-well
structure, with tunneling emerging for the ground state level at $\lambda
\approx 0.732953$. {For the lowest energy states \( n = 0,1,2,3 \), we
construct physically meaningful variational wavefunctions that $i)$ respect
parity symmetry under the transformation $ x \rightarrow -x $, $ii)$ exhibit
the correct asymptotic behavior at large distances, and $iii)$ allow for exact
analytical Fourier transforms. Variational energies match Lagrange Mesh and
available exact analytical QES results with relative errors $\simeq 10^{-8}$
for $n = 0, 1, 2$ and $\simeq 10^{-6}$ for the third excited state $n=3$. We
demonstrate that entropic measures (Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler, and
Cumulative Residual Jeffreys divergences) surpass conventional variance-based
methods in revealing tunneling transitions, wavefunction symmetry breaking, and
quantum state pairing. Our results confirm that the
Beckner-Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski entropic uncertainty relation holds across
all examined values of $n$ and $\lambda$. The quality of the trial function is
also validated by the small $\sim10^{-10}$ Cumulative Residual Jeffreys
divergences from the exact QES solutions.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了随机开放量子系统在中心极限定理之外的特性，特别是重尾系统-环境相互作用，揭示了独特的无间隙谱、帕累托原则支配的耗散等现象，挑战了稳定性与敏感性之间的权衡观念。

Result: 发现无间隙谱、帕累托原则支配的耗散等特性，量子相干性增强两个数量级。

Conclusion: 重尾开放量子系统为量子传感应用提供了理想平台。

Abstract: Understanding random open quantum systems is critical for characterizing the
performance of large-scale quantum devices and exploring macroscopic quantum
phenomena. Various features in these systems, including spectral distributions,
gap scaling, and decoherence, have been examined by modelling randomness under
the central limit theorem. Here, we investigate random open quantum systems
beyond the central limit theorem, focusing on heavy-tailed system-environment
interactions. By extending the Ginibre unitary ensemble, we model
system-environment interactions to exhibit a continuous transition from
light-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions. This generalized configuration
reveals unique properties-gapless spectra, Pareto principle governing
dissipation, orthogonalization, and quasi-degeneracies-all linked to the
violation of the central limit theorem. The synergy of these features
challenges the common belief-the tradeoff between stability and
sensitivity-through the emergence of long-lived and ultrasensitive quantum
coherences that exhibit an enhancement of two orders of magnitude compared to
predictions under the central limit theorem. The result, which is based on
heavy-tailedness of open quantum systems, provides highly desirable platforms
for quantum sensing applications.

Motivation: 传统cNMSSE框架仅适用于Debye型谱结构环境，无法处理一般谱密度问题。

Method: 采用完全非指数基展开处理浴相关函数，结合伪福克空间和矩阵乘积态（MPS）技术进行数值求解。

Result: 在四种代表性谱密度（离散谱、Ohmic谱、代数截止谱和临界阻尼布朗谱）的模拟中，与HFB-SSE和HEOM结果高度一致。

Conclusion: extended cNMSSE为一般环境下的非马尔可夫开放量子系统提供了高效、灵活且可扩展的模拟框架。

Abstract: We present an extended formulation of the non-Markovian stochastic
Schr\"odinger equation with complex frequency modes (extended cNMSSE), enabling
the treatment of open quantum system dynamics under general spectral densities.
This extension employs complete non-exponential basis expansions for the bath
correlation functions, thereby generalizing the applicability of the cNMSSE
framework beyond environments with Debye-type spectral structures. By
preserving the wavefunction-based description and favorable linear-scaling
properties, the extended cNMSSE offers an efficient and flexible approach to
simulate non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The method is implemented within a
pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved numerically
via matrix product state (MPS) techniques. Benchmark simulations on four
representative cases, including discrete spectra, Ohmic spectra with
exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral
densities, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of
forward-backward stochastic Schr\"odinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended
hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM). The extended cNMSSE thus provides a
robust and scalable framework for accurate simulations of non-Markovian open
quantum systems with general environments.

Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental
properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an
open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the
master equation. This makes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), the
operator of optimal sensitivity and key quantity in quantum metrology,
available to a large class of systems of interest, both in and
out-of-equilibrium. We validate our approach by reproducing the SLD for
temperature in quantum Brownian motion and demonstrate its versatility by
constructing the optimal observable for the non-equilibrium relaxation rate.

Conclusion: QSA算法和GASP在量子生物信息学中具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of a quantum sequence alignment (QSA)
algorithm on biological data in both simulated environments and real noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. The approach to quantum
bioinformatics adapts the original QSA algorithm proposed in 2000 to current
capabilities and limitations of NISQ-era quantum computers and uses a genetic
algorithm for state preparation (GASP) to create encoding circuits to load both
database and target sequences into the quantum data registers. The
implementation is tested in a simulated quantum computer environment to
validate the approach and refine the GASP data-loading circuit designs. The
results demonstrate the practicalities of deploying the QSA algorithm and
exemplify the potential of GASP for data encoding in the realm of quantum
circuit design, particularly for complex algorithms in quantum bioinformatics
and other data-rich problems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by
Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via
an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators
($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of
tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are
suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in
the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also
calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that
of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what
these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter
regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model
motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where
$\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively
in the symmetry-broken phase.

Result: 在部分问题上，该方法比量子神经网络更准确。

Conclusion: 该方法为QITE在量子机器学习中的应用奠定了基础，具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: Quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) is a powerful method to derive the
ground states of the systems. Only the damping of quantum states leads it;
hence, reaching the ground state is guaranteed by nature without any external
manipulation. Numerous QITE methods by many groups are used to improve speed
and accuracy, derive excited states, and solve combined optimization problems.
However, the QITE methods have not been used for quantum machine learning to
predict the ideal values for multiple input values. Therefore, we propose a
method for applying QITE methods for quantum machine learning and demonstrate
fitting problems of elementary functions and classification problems on a 2-D
plane. As a result, we confirmed that our method was more accurate than a
quantum neural network in solving some problems. Our method can be used for
other quantum machine learning algorithms; hence, it may be the milestone for
applying QITE to quantum machine learning.

Conclusion: 该结果为能量约束下绝对热化过程的涌现提供了新的描述方法。

Abstract: The maximum entropy principle states that the maximum entropy among all
quantum states with a fixed mean energy is achieved only by the thermal state
of given mean energy. In this notes, we prove the maximum entropy principle for
quantum processes -- the entropy of a quantum channel with fixed mean energy is
maximum if and only if the channel is absolutely thermalizing channel with the
fixed output thermal state of that mean energy. This allows for an alternate
approach to describe emergence of the absolute thermalization processes under
energy constraints in the observable universe.

Abstract: Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz
(THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging,
spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we
demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered
high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and
capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational
lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with
Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip
electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the
phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly
coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a
laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission
remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature.
We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up
to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1
over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from
superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state
coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and
quantum systems.

Motivation: 纠缠纯化是量子通信中的关键技术，但噪声环境下的性能表现尚需深入研究。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛模拟，扫描噪声参数（γ, p），分析DEJMPS协议对偏振纠缠光子对的纯化效果。

Result: 单次纯化可使保真度提升0.07，但产量损失高达0.55；保真度增益随噪声增加而单调上升，产量在组合噪声下下降更快。

Conclusion: 研究为实际光子网络中纯化深度和操作点的优化提供了实用指导，首次详细绘制了DEJMPS协议在连续噪声下的保真度和产量改进图。

Abstract: Entanglement purification is a critical enabling technology for quantum
communication, allowing high-fidelity entangled pairs to be distilled from
noisy resources. We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo study of the DEJMPS
purification protocol applied to polarization-entangled photon pairs subject to
both amplitude-damping noise (gamma) and dephasing noise (p). By sweeping
(gamma, p) over a two-dimensional grid and performing repeated stochastic
trials, we map out the average fidelity and average yield surfaces of the
purified output, as well as the net gains (DF) and losses (DY) relative to the
unpurified baseline. Our results show that a single round of DEJMPS
purification can boost entanglement fidelity by up to 0.07 in high-noise
regimes, while incurring a yield penalty of up to 0.55. Fidelity gains grow
monotonically with both gamma and p, whereas yields decline more sharply under
combined noise. Contour and 3D surface plots of DF(gamma, p) and (DY, gamma, p)
vividly illustrate the trade-off between quality and quantity of distilled
pairs. This two-parameter Monte Carlo characterization provides practical
guidance for optimizing purification depth and operating points in real-world
photonic networks, and represents, to our knowledge, the first detailed
numerical charting of both fidelity and yield improvements across a continuous
noise landscape for DEJMPS.

Abstract: Despite their Nobel Prize-winning empirical falsification, the interpretation
of the Bell inequality remains a subject of controversy. This article discusses
and attempts to clarify the reasons John S. Bell and A. Einstein claimed that
quantum entanglement implies puzzling nonlocal correlations that Einstein
famously termed ``spooky action at a distance.'' The issue remains highly
controversial and has roughly divided the scientific community into localists
and nonlocalists. Without taking a stance for either side in the long-standing,
polarized debate, we examine Bell's actual argument, highlighting the
differences between his approach and the current orthodoxy.

Conclusion: 该工作为量子环境下的零知识协议提供了新的理论基础和实用方案。

Abstract: The MPC-in-the-head technique (Ishai et al., STOC 2007) is a celebrated
method to build zero-knowledge protocols with desirable theoretical properties
and high practical efficiency. This technique has generated a large body of
research and has influenced the design of real-world post-quantum cryptographic
signatures. In this work, we present a generalization of the MPC-in-the-head
paradigm to the quantum setting, where the MPC is running a quantum
computation. As an application of our framework, we propose a new approach to
build zero-knowledge protocols where security holds even against a verifier
that can obtain a superposition of transcripts. This notion was pioneered by
Damgard et al., who built a zero-knowledge protocol for NP (in the common
reference string model) secure against superposition attacks, by relying on
perfectly hiding and unconditionally binding dual-mode commitments.
Unfortunately, no such commitments are known from standard cryptographic
assumptions. In this work we revisit this problem, and present two new
three-round protocols in the common reference string model: (i) A
zero-knowledge argument for NP, whose security reduces to the standard learning
with errors (LWE) problem. (ii) A zero-knowledge argument for QMA from the same
assumption.

Conclusion: 该协议为紧凑型高容量CVQKD系统提供了可行方案，适用于地面和空间THz量子通信。

Abstract: We propose a novel continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD)
protocol that employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the
terahertz (THz) band to enable high-throughput and secure quantum
communication. By encoding quantum information across multiple subcarriers, the
protocol enhances spectral efficiency and mitigates channel dispersion and
atmospheric attenuation. We present a comprehensive security analysis under
collective Gaussian attacks, considering both terrestrial free-space channels,
accounting for humidity-induced absorption, and inter-satellite links,
incorporating realistic intermodulation noise. Simulations show secret key
rates (SKR) reaching ~72 bits per channel use in open-air conditions. While
intermodulation noise imposes trade-offs, optimised modulation variance enables
resilience and secure communication range. The maximum terrestrial quantum link
extends up to 4.5 m due to atmospheric THz absorption, whereas inter-satellite
links can support secure communication over distances exceeding 100 km, owing
to minimal propagation channel losses in space. We evaluate the practical
implementation of our protocol using recently developed on-chip coherent THz
sources based on superconducting Josephson junctions. These compact,
voltage-tunable emitters produce wideband coherent radiation, making them ideal
candidates for integration in scalable quantum networks. By incorporating their
characteristics into our simulations, we assess secure key generation under
various environmental conditions. Our results show secure communication over
distances up to 3 m in open air, and up to 26 km in cryogenic or vacuum
environments. This work advances the prospect of compact, high-capacity CVQKD
systems for both terrestrial and space-based THz quantum communication.

quantum baker map, so that it may scramble two n-qudits. By doing so, we
enlarge its parameter space exponentially, leading to a better security. We
define two new concepts of mixed scrambling and mixed diffusion, and present a
variety of schemes, depending on the needs of the users.

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental representation of complex, nonlinear structured data
across various domains, including social networks and quantum systems. Quantum
Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNNs) have been proposed to model quantum
dynamics in graph-based quantum systems, but their applicability to classical
data remains an open problem. In this paper, we leverage QGRNNs to process
classical graph-structured data. In particular, we demonstrate how QGRNN can
reconstruct node features in classical datasets. Our results show that QGRNN
achieves high feature reconstruction accuracy, leading to near-perfect
classification. Furthermore, we propose an information hiding technique based
on our QGRNN, where messages are embedded into a graph, then retrieved under
certain conditions. We assess retrieval accuracy for different dictionary sizes
and message lengths, showing that QGRNN maintains high retrieval accuracy, with
minor degradation as complexity increases. These findings demonstrate the
scalability and robustness of QGRNNs for both classical data processing and
secure information hiding, paving the way for quantum-enhanced feature
extraction, privacy-preserving computations, and quantum steganography.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a cutting-edge field that leverages the
principles of quantum mechanics to enable secure communication between parties
involved. Single-photon quantum emitters offer remarkable on-demand photon
emission, near-unitary indistinguishability, and low multiphoton generation,
thereby enhancing the performance of QKD protocols. Standard approaches in
which the polarization degree-of-freedom is exploited are limited by the
precise alignment between the communicating parties. To overcome this obstacle,
the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of light represents a suitable candidate for
encoding the information, as it allows the implementation of
rotational-invariant photonic states that remove the need for a fixed physical
reference frame between the communicating parties. Here, we report the
implementation of an on-demand, rotational-invariant BB84-QKD protocol achieved
by exploiting a bright quantum dot source, active time-to-spatial
demultiplexing, and Q-plate devices with a space-variant pattern to encode
hybrid photonic states. Our findings suggest a viable direction for the use of
rotational-invariant hybrid states in on-demand QKD protocols, potentially
enhancing security and robustness in complex operational scenarios.

internal degrees of freedom (helicity or polarisation) of the scattered
particles. Computations are carried out for pure and maximally mixed initial

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach
for solving partial differential equations by embedding the governing physics
into the loss function associated with deep neural network. In this work, a
Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Network (QPINN) framework is proposed to solve
two-dimensional (2D) time-dependent Maxwell's equations. Our approach utilizes
a parameterized quantum circuit in conjunction with the classical neural
network architecture and enforces physical laws, including a global energy
conservation principle, during training. A quantum simulation library was
developed to efficiently compute circuit outputs and derivatives by leveraging
GPU acceleration based on PyTorch, enabling end-to-end training of the QPINN.
The method was evaluated on two 2D electromagnetic wave propagation problems:
one in free space (vacuum) and one with a dielectric medium. Multiple quantum
circuit ans\"atze, input scales, and an added loss term were compared in a
thorough ablation study. Furthermore, recent techniques to enhance PINN
convergence, including random Fourier feature embeddings and adaptive
time-weighting, were incorporated. Our results demonstrate that the QPINN
achieves accuracy comparable, and even greater than the classical PINN
baseline, while using a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters.
This study also shows that adding an energy conservation term to the loss
stabilizes training and improves the physical fidelity of the solution in the
lossless free-space case. This added term helps mitigate a new kind of a barren
plateau (BP) related phenomenon - ``black hole'' (BH) loss landscape for the
quantum experiments in that scenario. By optimizing the quantum-circuit ansatz
and embedding energy-conservation constraints, our QPINN achieves up to a 19
percent higher accuracy on 2D Maxwell benchmark problems compared to a
classical PINN.

Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are fundamental tools for detecting
entanglement. However traditional linear witnesses often fail to identify most
of the entangled states. In this work, we construct a family of nonlinear
entanglement witnesses by taking the envelope of linear witnesses defined over
continuous families of pure bipartite states with fixed Schmidt bases. This
procedure effectively "bends" the hyperplanes associated with linear witnesses
into curved hypersurfaces, thereby extending the region of detectable entangled
states. The resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the positive
semi-definiteness of a family of matrices, whose principal minors define a
hierarchy of increasingly sensitive detection criteria. We show that this
construction is not limited to the transposition map and generalizes naturally
to arbitrary Positive but not Completely Positive (PnCP) maps, leading to
nonlinear analogues of general entanglement witnesses. We emphasize that the
required measurements remain experimentally accessible, as the nonlinear
criteria are still formulated in terms of expectation values over local
operator bases. Through both analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate
that the proposed nonlinear witnesses outperform their linear counterparts in
detecting entangled states which may evade individual linear EWs in the
construction. This approach offers a practical and conceptually elegant
enhancement to entanglement detection in finite-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We study the efficacy of the two recently introduced witnesses of
non-Markovianity, namely that based on temporal correlations in pseudo-density
matrix and temporal steering correlations in detecting information backflow. We
show, through specific counterexamples taken from existing literature, that
they can witness a process to be non-Markovian where trace distance and
entropic distinguishability measures may fail. We further show that, since the
pseudo-density matrix is directly related to the Choi matrix of a channel via
the partial transpose, it can be generalized to quantify the total quantum
memory in any indivisible process. Moreover, we make an interesting observation
that temporal steerable correlations-based measure may not capture eternal
non-Markovianity hence may not be proportional to Choi-matrix-based methods,
while pseudo-density matrix-based measures introduced in this work faithfully
capture eternal non-Markovianity. Our work highlights important distinction
between weak and strong forms of quantum direct cause in quantum mechanics when
applied to open system dynamics.

Abstract: Operator scrambling, which governs the spread of quantum information in
many-body systems, is a central concept in both condensed matter and
high-energy physics. Accurately capturing the emergent properties of these
systems remains a formidable challenge for classical computation, while quantum
simulators have emerged as a powerful tool to address this complexity. In this
work, we reveal a fundamental connection between operator scrambling and the
reliability of quantum simulations. We show that the Trotter error in
simulating operator dynamics is bounded by the degree of operator scrambling,
providing the most refined analysis of Trotter errors in operator dynamics so
far. Furthermore, we investigate the entanglement properties of the evolved
states, revealing that sufficient entanglement can lead to error scaling
governed by the normalized Frobenius norms of both the observables of interest
and the error operator, thereby enhancing simulation robustness and efficiency
compared to previous works. We also show that even in regimes where the
system's entanglement remains low, operator-induced entanglement can still
emerge and suppress simulation errors. Our results unveil a comprehensive
relationship between Trotterization, operator scrambling, and entanglement,
offering new perspectives for optimizing quantum simulations.

Motivation: 探索非厄米耦合自旋-振子系统的独特性质，特别是其希尔伯特空间结构和量子相变行为。

Method: 利用$G$-内积框架，计算了热熵、冯·诺依曼熵和Rényi熵等熵度量，并分析其在相变点的行为。

Result: 发现熵度量在量子相变点非解析，且一阶导数不连续，表明相变为一级相变。

Conclusion: 非厄米耦合系统在相变点表现出显著的非解析行为，符合一级相变的特征。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe some interesting properties of a spin-oscillator
system with non-Hermitian coupling. As shown earlier, the Hilbert space of this
problem can be described by infinitely-many closed two-dimensional invariant
subspaces together with the global ground state. We expose the appearance of
exceptional points (EP) on such two-dimensional subspaces together with quantum
phase transitions marking the transit from real to complex eigenvalues. We
analytically compute some information-theoretic measures for this intriguing
system, namely, the thermal entropy as well as the von Neumann and R\'enyi
entropies using the framework of the so-called \(G\)-inner product. Such
entropic measures are verified to be non-analytic at the points which mark the
quantum phase transitions on the space of parameters -- a naive comparison with
Ehrenfest's classification of phase transitions then suggests that these
transitions are of the first order as the first derivatives of the entropies
are discontinuous across such transitions.

also think it would be a good idea to share the second volume on arXiv so that
more people can read it for free, and I can continue to update the contents. As

Conclusion: 该方法为量子系统的相空间分析提供了新工具，有助于深入理解光与物质相互作用的基本现象。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the phase space formulation of the Jaynes-Cummings
model through the explicit construction of the full Wigner function for a
hybrid bipartite quantum system composed of a two-level atom and a quantized
coherent field. By employing the Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence and the
coadjoint orbit method, we derive an informationally complete quasi-probability
distribution that captures the full dynamics of light-matter interaction. This
approach provides a detailed phase space perspective of fundamental quantum
phenomena such as Rabi oscillations, atomic population inversion, and
entanglement generation. We further measure the purity of the reduced quantized
field state by means of an appropriate Wigner function corresponding to the
bosonic field part in order to investigate the entanglement dynamics of the
system.

A simple quantum mechanical calculation is presented, inspired in part by a

Abstract: A quantum-mechanical wave function is complex, but all observations are real,
expressible through expectation values and transition matrix elements that
involve the wave functions. It can be useful to separate at the outset the
amplitude and phase as real quantities that together carry the same information
that is contained in the complex wave function. Two main avenues for doing so
go way back in the history of the subject and have been used both for
scattering and bound states. A connection is made here to gauge transformations
of electrodynamics where the advent of quantum mechanics and later quantum
field theory showed the central role that local gauge transformations play in
physics.

Result: 理论研究表明，在当前实验条件下，14N核自旋的静态磁场灵敏度可达10^(-7) T/Hz^(1/2)/N^(1/2)。

Conclusion: 该方法为直流磁场的高灵敏度测量提供了新思路，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: High-sensitivity magnetometers play a crucial role in various domains,
including fundamental physics, biomedical imaging, and navigation. Levitated
diamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers exhibit significant potential
for magnetic sensing due to their high mechanical quality (Q) factor and long
spin coherence time. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on
electron spin-based measurements of alternating current (AC) magnetic fields.
In this letter, we propose a novel approach for direct current (DC) magnetic
field measurement based on the Berry phase generated by three-dimensional
rotation. We analyze the adiabatic evolution of the 14N nuclear spin inside a
levitated 3D rotating diamond with frequencies around MHz. Our finding reveals
that the Berry phase exhibits high sensitivity to external parameters near
rotation induced nuclear spin resonance. Using this mechanism, we theoretically
demonstrate that the static magnetic field sensitivity can reach 10^(-7)
T/Hz^(1/2)/N^(1/2) for 14N nuclear spins under the current experimental
conditions.

Result: 频率啁啾显著提高了获得解态的成功概率，且模拟结果与实验数据一致。

Conclusion: 频率啁啾对基于KPO的量子退火器具有显著效果和适用性。

Abstract: We study parametric oscillations of two capacitively coupled Kerr parametric
oscillators (KPOs) with frequency-chirped two- and one-photon drives. The
two-KPO system adiabatically evolves from the initial vacuum state to an
oscillation state corresponding to a solution state in quantum-annealing
applications. Frequency chirping dynamically changes the detuning between
resonance and oscillation frequencies during parametric modulation and reduces
unwanted population transfer to excited states caused by pure dephasing and
photon loss. We observe that frequency chirping increases the success
probability to obtain the solution state and that simulations taking into
account pure dephasing reproduce experiments with and without frequency
chirping. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of
frequency chirping to a KPO-based quantum annealer.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the
state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in
evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation
methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the

the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate
that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework
applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by
low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground
states of Hamiltonians.

Abstract: Trapped ions constitute a promising platform for implementation of a quantum
network. Recently, a dual-type qubit scheme has been realized in a quantum
network node where the communication qubits and the memory qubits are encoded
in different energy levels of the same ion species, such that the generation of
ion-photon entanglement on the communication qubits has negligible crosstalk
error on the preloaded quantum information in the memory qubits. However, to
achieve the versatile applications of a quantum network, a crucial component of
the dual-type node, namely the entangling gate between the communication and
the memory qubits, is still missing. Here we report a dual-type quantum network
node equipped with ion-photon entanglement generation, crosstalk-free quantum
memory and entangling gates between the dual-type qubits simultaneously. We
demonstrate its practical applications including the quantum state
teleportation and the preparation of multipartite entangled state. Our work
achieves the necessary components of a dual-type quantum network node and paves
the way toward its applications in a large-scale quantum internet.

Abstract: The traditional clustering problem of renewable energy profiles is typically
formulated as a combinatorial optimization that suffers from the Curse of
Dimensionality (CoD) on classical computers. To address this issue, this paper
first proposed a kernel-based quantum clustering method. More specifically, the
kernel-based similarity between profiles with minimal intra-group distance is
encoded into the ground-state of the Hamiltonian in the form of an Ising model.
Then, this NP-hard problem can be reformulated into a Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO), which a Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) can naturally
solve with significant improvement over classical computers. The test results
from a real optical quantum computer verify the validity of the proposed
method. It also demonstrates its ability to address CoD in an NP-hard
clustering problem.

Conclusion: 研究为量子网络中的steering检测和自测试提供了新方法，并展示了其鲁棒性和普适性。

Abstract: Quantum networks with independent sources allow observing quantum nonlocality
or steering with just a single measurement per node of the network, or without
any inputs. Inspired by the recently introduced notion of swap-steering, we
consider here the triangle network scenario without inputs, where one of the
parties is trusted to perform a well-calibrated measurement. In this scenario,
we first propose a linear witness to detect triangle network swap-steering.
Then, by using the correlations that achieve the maximum value of this
inequality, and assuming that all the sources are the same, we can self-test
the state generated by the sources and the measurements of the untrusted party.
We then extend this framework to ring networks with an arbitrary number of
nodes with one of them being trusted. Interestingly, this is the first example
of a topologically robust, that is, one can observe steerability without
assuming the network structure of the network, as well as noise-robust quantum
advantage in a network. Additionally, by allowing the trusted party to perform
tomography of their subsystems, we demonstrate that every bipartite entangled
state will result in swap-steerable correlations in the ring network. For this
purpose, we construct linear witnesses to detect ring network swap-steering
corresponding to every bipartite entangled state.

Conclusion: 本文首次提出了一种查询最优的保真度估计方法，适用于涉及混合态的场景，并展示了其技术简单性和高效性。

Abstract: We present an optimal quantum algorithm for fidelity estimation between two
quantum states when one of them is pure. In particular, the (square root)
fidelity of a mixed state to a pure state can be estimated to within additive
error $\varepsilon$ by using $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ queries to their
state-preparation circuits, achieving a quadratic speedup over the folklore
$O(1/\varepsilon^2)$. Our approach is technically simple, and can moreover
estimate the quantity $\sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(\rho\sigma^2)}$ that is not
common in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
query-optimal approach to fidelity estimation involving mixed states.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a general and exact method for classicalizing

into a classical-like framework using the geometry of complex projective spaces

procedure to derive a classical Hamiltonian and a symplectic structure for the
Poisson brackets, yielding $N-1$ Hamilton's equations that precisely replicate
the quantum dynamics, including complex phenomena like entanglement. We
demonstrate the method's efficacy by classicalizing two interacting qubits in
$\mathbb{CP}^3$, exactly reproducing quantum observables such as quantum
probabilities, quaternionic population differences and the concurrence,
capturing entanglement dynamics via a classical analog.

Result: 改进后的方法能够识别标准CCN方法无法检测的纠缠态，扩展了CCN的实用性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的改进条件显著提升了CCN方法在X态纠缠检测中的有效性。

Abstract: The Computable Cross Norm (CCN), or realignment criterion, is a widely used
method for entanglement detection in quantum systems; however, it typically
provides only a necessary condition. In this work, we advance the applicability
of the realignment criterion by deriving a condition that is both necessary and
sufficient for detecting entanglement in two-qubit. $X$-states derive their
name from the characteristic 'X' shape of their density matrix, which contains
seven independent matrix parameters. Notably, they incorporate several
important subclasses of entangled states, including Bell states, Werner states,
and maximally entangled mixed states. $X$-states have proven highly useful in
entanglement studies due to their sparse structure and the ease with which
entanglement-related quantities can be computed. This refined criterion
improves the identification of entangled states that the standard CCN approach
fails to detect, thereby extending the utility of the method.

Abstract: This work focuses on optimizing the gates of a quantum circuit with a given
topology to approximate the unitary time evolution governed by a Hamiltonian.
Recognizing that unitary matrices form a mathematical manifold, we employ
Riemannian optimization methods -- specifically the Riemannian trust-region
algorithm -- which involves second derivative calculations with respect to the
gates. Our key technical contribution is a matrix-free algorithmic framework
that avoids the explicit construction and storage of large unitary matrices
acting on the whole Hilbert space. Instead, we evaluate all quantities as sums
over state vectors, assuming that these vectors can be stored in memory. We
develop HPC-optimized kernels for applying gates to state vectors and for the
gradient and Hessian computation. Further improvements are achieved by
exploiting sparsity structures due to Hamiltonian conservation laws, such as
parity conservation, and lattice translation invariance. We benchmark our
implementation on the Fermi-Hubbard model with up to 16 sites, demonstrating a
nearly linear parallelization speed-up with up to 112 CPU threads. Finally, we
compare our implementation with an alternative matrix product operator-based
approach.

Motivation: 传统阴影过程层析成像（SPT）依赖随机酉算子，难以确定最小化阴影范数的最优酉算子，影响样本复杂度。

Method: 利用广义测量（POVM）替代酉算子，通过凸优化确定最优POVM，以减少阴影范数。

Result: 数值实验显示，POVM-SPT在单量子比特输入状态下阴影范数降低约7倍，64量子比特输入状态下降低2^180倍。

Conclusion: POVM-SPT显著简化了SPT任务，尤其适用于大规模量子系统。

Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for advancing quantum
technologies, including quantum computers, quantum networks and quantum
sensors. Shadow process tomography (SPT) utilizes the Choi isomorphism to map
QPT to shadow state tomography (SST), significantly reducing the sample
complexity for extracting information from quantum processes. However, SPT
relies on random unitary operators and complicates the determination of the
optimal unitary operator that minimizes the shadow norm, which is the key
factor influencing the sample complexity. In this work, we propose a
generalized SPT framework that minimizes the shadow norm by replacing unitary
operators with generalized measurements (POVMs). This approach, termed shadow
process tomography with POVMs (POVM-SPT), uses convex optimization to identify
the optimal POVM for minimizing the shadow norm, thereby further reducing
sample complexity. We demonstrate the identification of the optimal POVM
through numerical simulations and provide the corresponding optimization
algorithms. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that POVM-SPT achieves a
substantial reduction in shadow norm compared to conventional SPT, with an
approximate 7-fold improvement for single-qubit input states and a remarkable
$2^{180}$-fold enhancement for 64-qubit input states. These results reveal that
POVM-SPT offers significant advantages in simplifying SPT tasks, particularly
for large-scale quantum systems.

Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit quantum system in contact with an environment
modeled by a microscopic collision model with added ancilla-ancilla collisions
in the non-Markovian regime. Two schemes of the two-qubit collision model with
carried-forward correlations are introduced. In one scheme, a single stream of
ancillae interacts with only one of the qubits of the two-qubit system; in the
other, both the qubits interact with two independent sequences of ancillae,
which could be at the same or different temperatures. The system's
non-Markovian evolution is examined using the trace distance measure, and the
non-classicality of the system is studied using the Wigner function,
non-classical volume, and concurrence. Also, interesting steady-state behavior
is observed when both the independent ancillae are kept at the same
temperature.

Conclusion: OTA为实验实现提供了基础，扩展了量子场模拟器的应用范围。

Abstract: Quantum field simulators provide unique opportunities for investigating the
dynamics of quantum fields through tabletop experiments. A primary drawback of
standard encoding schemes is their rigidity: altering the theory, its coupling
geometry, metric structure, or simulation time typically requires redesigning
the experimental setup, which imposes strong constraints on the types of
dynamics and theories that can be simulated. Here, we introduce the Optical
Time Algorithm (OTA) as a unifying framework, enabling the efficient simulation
of large classes of free quantum field dynamics using a single optical circuit
design that separates the time from the Hamiltonian's structure. By modifying
the parameters of the optical elements, our method allows us to engineer
timescales, coupling graphs, spacetime metrics, and boundary conditions,
thereby facilitating the implementation of relativistic and non-relativistic,
real- and complex-valued, short- and long-range quantum field theories on both
flat and curved spacetimes. We exploit the OTA's configurability to investigate
the spreading of quantum correlations in space and time for theories with
continuously varying coupling ranges. Relevant features predicted by quantum
field theory can be observed on systems of $10-20$ modes, which paves the
ground for experimental implementations.

Conclusion: 浅层量子电路的随机性生成是普遍但复杂的现象，依赖于群与具体应用的交互。

Abstract: We provide a range of results on several groups of broad interest in quantum
information science: the Clifford group, the orthogonal group, the unitary
symplectic groups, and the matchgate group. For all of these groups, we prove
that analogues of unitary designs cannot be generated by any circuit ensemble
with light-cones that are smaller than the system size. This implies linear
lower bounds on the circuit depth in one-dimensional systems. For the Clifford
and orthogonal group, we moreover show that a broad class of circuits cannot
generate designs in sub-linear depth on any circuit architecture. We show this
by exploiting observables in the higher-order commutants of each group, which
allow one to distinguish any short-depth circuit from truly random. While these
no-go results rule out short-depth unitary designs, we prove that slightly
weaker forms of randomness -- including additive-error state designs and
anti-concentration in sampling distributions -- nevertheless emerge at
logarithmic depths in many cases. Our results reveal that the onset of
randomness in shallow quantum circuits is a widespread yet subtle phenomenon,
dependent on the interplay between the group itself and the context of its
application.

Abstract: We introduce a method to simulate open quantum many-body dynamics by
combining time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) with quantum trajectory
techniques. Our approach unravels the Lindblad master equation into an ensemble
of stochastic Schr\"odinger equations for a variational ansatz, avoiding the
exponential cost of density matrix evolution. The method is compatible with
generic ansatz\"e, including expressive neural-network wavefunctions. We derive
the nonlinear stochastic equations of motion for the variational parameters and
employ suitable Stratonovich numerical solvers. To validate our approach, we
simulate quenches in the locally dissipative long-range Ising model in a
transverse field, accurately capturing non-equilibrium magnetization and spin
squeezing dynamics relevant to trapped-ion and Rydberg atom experiments. The
framework is computationally efficient, scalable on high-performance computing
platforms, and can be readily integrated into existing tVMC implementations.
This work enables large-scale simulations of complex, dissipative quantum
systems in higher dimensions, with broad implications for quantum technology
and fundamental science.

Abstract: In a pure Gaussian tripartition, a range of entanglement between two parties
($AB$) can be purified through classical communication of Gaussian measurements
performed within the third ($C$). To begin, this work introduces a direct
method to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the
removal of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior
protocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the
maximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian
entanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or
required between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and
sufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume,
defining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this
distance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free
scalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that
remains asymptotically constant with increasing vacuum separation and (2) the
lowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring
the mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a
generalization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques
allows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$
entanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and
GEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization
techniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum
fields.

Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice of a
single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the
Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall
of the synthetic lattice, whose spin polarization is topologically protected.
To address the challenge of applying band topology to the Fock-state lattice,
we introduce a topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the
phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, representing the
geometric phase difference between two sublattices, can also be computed using
a phase-space parameter and corresponds directly to the phase-space winding
number. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the
defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting
phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with
contrasting properties-topologically protected fermionic states and
driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a
novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic
dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from
classical analogs.

Abstract: In quantum communication, quantum state transfer from one location to another
in a quantum network plays a prominent role, where the impact of noise could be
crucial. The idea of state transfer can be fruitfully associated with quantum
walk on graphs. We investigate the consequences of non-Markovian quantum noises
on periodicity and state transfer induced by a discrete-time quantum walk on
graphs, governed by the Grover coin operator. Different bipartite graphs, such
as the path graph, cycle graph, star graph, and complete bipartite graph,
present periodicity and state transfer in a discrete-time quantum walk
depending on the topology of the graph. We investigate the effect of quantum
non-Markovian Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and modified non-Markovian
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise (OUN) on state transfer and periodicity. We
demonstrate how the RTN and OUN noises allow state transfer and periodicity for
a finite number of steps in a quantum walk. Our investigation brings out the
feasibility of state transfer in a noisy environment.

Abstract: Microwave drives are essential for implementing control and readout
operations in superconducting quantum circuits. However, increasing the drive
strength eventually leads to unwanted state transitions which limit the speed
and fidelity of such operations. In this work, we systematically investigate
such transitions in a fixed-frequency qubit subjected to microwave drives
spanning a 9 GHz frequency range. We identify the physical origins of these
transitions and classify them into three categories. (1) Resonant energy
exchange with parasitic two-level systems, activated by drive-induced ac-Stark
shifts, (2) multi-photon transitions to non-computational states, intrinsic to
the circuit Hamiltonian, and (3) inelastic scattering processes in which the
drive causes a state transition in the superconducting circuit, while
transferring excess energy to a spurious electromagnetic mode or two-level
system (TLS) material defect. We show that the Floquet steady-state simulation,
complemented by an electromagnetic simulation of the physical device,
accurately predicts the observed transitions that do not involve TLS. Our
results provide a comprehensive classification of these transitions and offer
mitigation strategies through informed choices of drive frequency as well as
improved circuit design.

Result: 非目标攻击降低分类准确率高达74.08%，目标攻击降低目标类准确率高达79.78%。

Conclusion: SQUASH攻击暴露了HQNN的关键漏洞，需开发更抗干扰的架构。

Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to
sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks.
SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum
circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial
input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to
qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is
highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce
detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH
significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks
reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target
class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability
in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures
against circuit-level adversarial interventions.

of the confined particle before flying away to the left or to the right. We
present a non-perturbative formulation and computational scheme that determines
the probability of any such outcome, as a function of the initial state of the
confined particle and the energy of the incident particle.

Abstract: Obtaining accurate representations of the eigenstates of an array of coupled
superconducting qubits is a crucial step in the design of circuit quantum
electrodynamics (QED)-based quantum processors. However, exact diagonalization
of the device Hamiltonian is challenging for system sizes beyond tens of
qubits. Here, we employ a variant of the density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) algorithm, DMRG-X, to efficiently obtain localized eigenstates of a 2D
transmon array without the need to first compute lower-energy states. We also
introduce MTDMRG-X, a new algorithm that combines DMRG-X with multi-target DMRG
to efficiently compute excited states even in regimes with strong eigenstate
hybridization. We showcase the use of these methods for the analysis of
long-range couplings in a multi-transmon Hamiltonian including qubits and
couplers, and we discuss eigenstate localization. These developments facilitate
the design and parameter optimization of large-scale superconducting quantum
processors.

Conclusion: 该方法可用于学习未知量子通道的奇异值矩，对测试量子通道是否破坏纠缠具有实际意义。

Abstract: Given the ability to apply an unknown quantum channel acting on a
$d$-dimensional system, we develop a quantum algorithm for transforming its
singular values. The spectrum of a quantum channel as a superoperator is
naturally tied to its Liouville representation, which is in general
non-Hermitian. Our key contribution is an approximate block-encoding scheme for
this representation in a Hermitized form, given only black-box access to the
channel; this immediately allows us to apply polynomial transformations to the
channel's singular values by quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). We
then demonstrate an $O(d^2/\delta)$ upper bound and an $\Omega(d/\delta)$ lower
bound for the query complexity of constructing a quantum channel that is
$\delta$-close in diamond norm to a block-encoding of the Hermitized Liouville
representation. We show our method applies practically to the problem of
learning the $q$-th singular value moments of unknown quantum channels for
arbitrary $q>2, q\in \mathbb{R}$, which has implications for testing if a
quantum channel is entanglement breaking.

Abstract: We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility
associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network
model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as
the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size
scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical
exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the
spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field
conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The
roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different
dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized
numerically and using a mean field approximation.

Abstract: The spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) is a promising optical hardware
solver for large-scale combinatorial optimization problems with dense
interactions. As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling
matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability
to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the
implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to
represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the
intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO
(spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional
structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with
the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can
be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further
demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial
optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results
advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs
exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency
is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional
structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).

component with the phonon wind. This picture does not apply to superfluids in
which Galilean invariance is broken either by disorder, or porous media, or
lattice potential, and the phonon wind is no longer responsible for depletion
of the superfluid component. Based on Popov's hydrodynamic action with
aharmonic terms, we present a general theory for temperature dependence of the
superfluid stiffness at low $T$, which reproduces Landau result as a special
case when several parameters of the hydrodynamic action are fixed by the
Galilean invariance. At the technical level, the theory of low-temperature
depletion in a $d$-dimensional quantum superfluid maps onto the problem of
finite-size corrections in a $(d+1)$-dimensional anisotropic
(pseudo-)classical-field system with U(1)-symmetric complex-valued action. We
validate our theory with numeric simulations of interacting lattice bosons and
the J-current model. In a broader context, our approach reveals universal
low-temperature thermodynamics of superfluids.

Abstract: Spin mixtures of degenerate fermions are a cornerstone of quantum many-body
physics, enabling superfluidity, polarons, and rich spin dynamics through
$s$-wave scattering resonances. Combining them with strong, long-range dipolar
interactions provides highly flexible control schemes promising even more
exotic quantum phases. Recently, microwave shielding gave access to
spin-polarized degenerate samples of dipolar fermionic molecules, where tunable
$p$-wave interactions were enabled by field-linked resonances available only by
compromising the shielding. Here, we study the scattering properties of a
fermionic dipolar spin mixture and show that a universal $s$-wave resonance is
readily accessible without compromising the shielding. We develop a universal
description of the tunable $s$-wave interaction and weakly bound tetratomic
states based on the microwave-field parameters. The $s$-wave resonance paves
the way to stable, controllable and strongly-interacting dipolar spin mixtures
of deeply degenerate fermions and supports favorable conditions to reach this
regime via evaporative cooling.

Abstract: We propose a novel scheme to realize the supersolid phase in ultracold gases

It is shown through quantum Monte-Carlo calculations that the interplay of the
anisotropies between the interaction and trapping potential gives rise to rich
quantum phases. Particularly, it is found that the supersolid phase emerges in
the parameter regime accessible to current experiments. Our study paves the way
for exploring the properties of supersolid phases in ultracold gases of polar

Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for
programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we
investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms.
Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent
double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and
crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole
interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a
DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS
regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order.
Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally
accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In an isolated ideal Bose system with a fixed energy, the number of
microstates depends solely on the configurations of bosons in excited states,
implying zero entropy for particles in the ground state. When two such systems
merge, the resulting entropy is less than the sum of the individual entropies.
This entropy decrease is numerically shown to arise from an effectively but
anomalous exchange of particles in excited states, where
$\overline{N}!/(\overline{N}_{1}!\overline{N}_{2}!)<1$. Here, $\overline{N}$,
$\overline{N}_{1}$, and $\overline{N}_{2}$ are real decimals representing,
respectively, the mean number of particles in excited states in the merged
system and the two individual systems before merging, with
$\overline{N}<\overline{N}_{1}+\overline{N}_{2}$.

Abstract: We explore the application of the nonperturbative functional renormalization
group (NPFRG) within its most common approximation scheme based on truncations
of the derivative expansion to the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar $\varphi^4$ theory as
the lower critical dimension $d_{\rm lc}$ is approached. We aim to assess
whether the NPFRG - a broad, nonspecialized method which is accurate in $d\geq
2$ - can capture the effect of the localized (droplet) excitations that drive
the disappearance of the phase transition in $d_{\rm lc}$ and control the
critical behavior as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$. We extend a prior analysis to the next
(second) order of the derivative expansion, which turns out to be much more
involved. Through extensive numerical and analytical work we provide evidence
that the convergence to $d_{\rm lc}$ is nonuniform in the field dependence and
is characterized by the emergence of a boundary layer near the minima of the
fixed-point effective potential. This is the mathematical mechanism through
which the NPFRG within the truncated derivative expansion reproduces nontrivial
features predicted by the droplet theory of Bruce and Wallace [1,2], namely,
the existence of two distinct small parameters as $d\to d_{\rm lc}$ that
control different aspects of the critical behavior and that are
nonperturbatively related.

Conclusion: 为强耦合下的随机热力学建立了严格框架，解决了传统定义中的问题。

Abstract: We consider a small Hamiltonian system strongly interacting with a much
larger Hamiltonian system (the bath), while being driven by both a
time-dependent control parameter and non-conservative forces. The joint system
is assumed to be thermally isolated. Under the assumption of time-scale
separation (TSS)--where the bath equilibrates much faster than the system and
the external driving--the bath remains in instantaneous equilibrium, described
by the microcanonical ensemble conditioned on the system state and the control
parameter. We identify a decomposition of the total Hamiltonian that renders
the bath energy an adiabatic invariant under slow evolution. This same
decomposition defines the system Hamiltonian as the Hamiltonian of mean force,
and ensures that neither the system nor the control parameter does reactive
work on the bath. Using time-reversal symmetry and TSS, and without invoking
any model details, we rigorously prove that the reduced dynamics of the system
is Markovian and satisfies a form of local detailed balance (LDB) which
involves transition probabilities but not path probabilities. By working
entirely within the microcanonical framework and adopting a precise
decomposition of the total energy, we provide rigorous definitions of bath
entropy as the Boltzmann entropy, and of heat as the negative change of the
bath energy. Our approach bypasses the ambiguities associated with conventional
definitions of thermodynamic variables and path probabilities, and establishes
a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent foundation for stochastic
thermodynamics, valid even under strong system-bath coupling.

Conclusion: Potts模型在非平衡条件下表现出复杂的动态行为，与平衡状态存在显著差异。

Abstract: We studied the long-term nonequilibrium dynamics of q-state Potts models with
q = 4, 5, 6, and 8 using Monte Carlo simulations on a two-dimensional square
lattice. When the contact energies between the nearest neighbors for the
standard Potts models are used, cyclic changes in the q homogeneous phases and
q-state coexisting wave mode appear at low and high flipping energies,
respectively, for all values of q. However, for a factorizable q value, dynamic
modes with skipping states emerge, depending on the contact energies. For q =
6, a spiral wave mode with three domain types (one state dominant or two states
mixed) and cyclic changes in three homogeneous phases are found. Although three
states can coexist spatially under thermal equilibrium, the scaling exponents
of the transitions to the wave modes are modified from the equilibrium values.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear
time-delayed Langevin systems. We analytically characterize two distinct
critical classes: (i) diffusive criticality, where the variance grows linearly
with suppressed/enhanced diffusion due to time-delayed forces, and (ii)
oscillatory criticality, exhibiting oscillations with diffusing amplitude.
Crucially, we derive asymptotic heat dissipation rates, revealing fundamentally
different thermodynamic signatures: a constant dissipation rate for diffusive
criticality and linear divergence accompanied by oscillations for oscillatory
criticality. These results highlight how spectral properties of dynamics govern
nonequilibrium thermodynamics in time-delayed systems. Our work bridges
dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics at stability boundaries for linear
systems, providing foundational insights for extending thermodynamic frameworks
to nonlinear time-delayed stochastic systems.

Abstract: Modern computing architectures are vastly more energy-dissipative than
fundamental thermodynamic limits suggest, motivating the search for principled
approaches to low-dissipation logical operations. We formulate multi-bit
logical gates (bit erasure, NAND) as optimal transport problems, extending
beyond classical one-dimensional bit erasure to scenarios where existing
methods fail. Using entropically regularized unbalanced optimal transport, we
derive tractable solutions and establish general energy-speed-accuracy
trade-offs that demonstrate that faster, more accurate operations necessarily
dissipate more energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Landauer limits
cannot be trivially overcome in higher dimensional geometries. We develop
practical algorithms combining optimal transport with generative modeling
techniques to construct dynamical controllers that follow Wasserstein
geodesics. These protocols achieve near-optimal dissipation and can, in
principle, be implemented in realistic experimentally set-ups. The framework
bridges fundamental thermodynamic limits with scalable computational design for
energy-efficient information processing.

Abstract: We study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving by an external
field $H$ at different scales of driving rate $v_H$, where the noise strength
$\sigma$ quantifies the deviation of the system size from the thermodynamic
limit. For large systems with small $\sigma$, we find the coercivity
$H_c=H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with
increasing $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase from zero, stable plateau ($v_H^0$),
$v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The
$H_c$-plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static
limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to
0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the first-order phase
transition (FOPT) point. In the post-plateau slow-driving regime, $H_c-H^*$
scales with $v_H^{2/3}$. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the
coercivity plateau $H_P$ as $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing
renormalization-group theory. These predicted scaling relations are
demonstrated in magnetic hysteresis obtained with the Curie-Weiss model. Our
work provides a panoramic view of the finite-time evolution of the stochastic
$\phi^4$ model, bridges dynamics of FOPT and dynamic phase transition, and
offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in
non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances of translationally invariant
magnetization-conserving qubit circuits via the spectrum of the
quasi-momentum-resolved truncated propagator of extensive observables.
Diffusive transport of the conserved magnetization is reflected in the Gaussian
quasi-momentum $k$ dependence of the leading eigenvalue (Ruelle-Pollicott
resonance) of the truncated propagator for small $k$. This, in particular,
allows us to extract the diffusion constant. For large $k$, the leading
Ruelle-Pollicott resonance is not related to transport and governs the
exponential decay of correlation functions. Additionally, we conjecture the
existence of a continuum of eigenvalues below the leading diffusive resonance,
which governs non-exponential decay, for instance, power-law hydrodynamic
tails. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic systems with exactly one
U(1) conserved quantity.

Abstract: Free theories are landmarks in the landscape of quantum field theories: their
exact solvability serves as a pillar for perturbative constructions of
interacting theories. Fuzzy sphere regularization, which combines quantum Hall
physics with state-operator correspondence, has recently been proposed as a
promising framework for simulating three-dimensional conformal field theories
(CFTs), but so far it has not provided access to free theories. We overcome
this limitation by designing a bilayer quantum Hall system that hosts an Ising
tricritical point -- a nontrivial fixed point where first-order and
second-order transitions meet -- which flows to the conformally coupled scalar
theory in the infrared. The critical energy spectrum and operator structure
match those at the Gaussian fixed point, providing nonperturbative evidence for
the emergence of a free scalar CFT. Our results expand the landscape of CFTs
realizable on the fuzzy sphere and demonstrate that even free bosonic theories
-- previously inaccessible -- can emerge from interacting electrons in this
framework.

Abstract: The delafossite-like compound NaYbO$_2$ hosts a triangular lattice of
Yb$^{3+}$ moments and is a promising candidate for realizing a quantum spin
liquid state. Here we leverage the substitution of nonmagnetic Lu$^{3+}$ onto
the Yb$^{3+}$ sites to track the evolution of the quantum disordered ground
state with increasing magnetic disorder in NaYb$_{1-x}$Lu$_x$O$_2$. Low
temperature $\mu$SR measurements preclude conventional spin freezing and
magnetic inhomogeneity, and instead resolve resilient, correlated magnetic
fluctuations that persist to at least 15$\%$ dilution. Heat capacity and
magnetic susceptibility measurements resolve a rapid suppression of the
field-induced ``up-up-down" phase upon introducing magnetic disorder and a
crossover in the power-law behavior of the low-temperature magnetic excitations
associated with the zero-field quantum disordered ground state. Our combined
results place constraints on theories modeling the emergence of the quantum
spin liquid-like behavior in NaYbO$_2$.

Abstract: It is generally believed that spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry is
restricted by Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. A special case is that the 1D
ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain holds long-range order because the order
parameter commutes with the Hamiltonian. The other one is that the recently
found frustration-free Hamiltonians can bypass this theorem, but the observed
symmetry breaking is fragile under generic perturbations. In this work, we have
discovered a new example that goes beyond the above two examples -- a 1D
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model -- that can achieve spontaneous breaking of
continuous symmetry. Importantly, it is not a frustration-free model and its
order parameter does not commute with the Hamiltonian. Moreover, the long-range
order is robust under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Combining numerical
simulation and theoretical analysis, we have further confirmed and understood
this nontrivial phenomenon.

Abstract: We find an efficient approach to approximately convert matrix product states

quantum states for quantum many-body ground-state calculations in polynomial

rank of the CP decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method by
taking the transverse-field Ising model as an example and discuss possible
applications of our method to more general quantum many-body systems in which
the ground-state wave functions possess complex nodal structures.

Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit high carrier mobility
and tunability, making them suitable for low-power, high-performance electronic
and spintronic applications. Incorporating narrow-band electronic correlation
effects could further promote tunability, though mass renormalization may
impact carrier mobility. It is therefore challenging to identify a vdW material
with both high mobility and strong correlation. Herein, by a combination of
optical spectroscopy and high-field quantum-oscillation measurements, we
observe significant effective-mass enhancement in CeTe$_3$ at low temperature,
arising from not only the band-structure modulation by antiferromagnetic
ordering but also the narrow-band correlation effect. Despite the mass
enhancement, the quantum mobility surprisingly \textit{increases} and reaches
$\sim$2403 cm$^2$/Vs, likely benefiting from topological protection.
Remarkably, these unique properties are maintained in atomically thin
nanoflakes with quantum mobility enhanced to $\sim$3158 cm$^2$/Vs. Thus,
CeTe$_3$ emerges as a promising vdW antiferromagnetic metal with high-mobility
heavy quasiparticles, potentially unlocking new device concepts.

Abstract: We have re-investigated the crystal structure of a spinel type CuIr2S4 at low
temperatures using a single-crystal in a synchrotron radiation x-ray
diffraction experiment. The crystal structure of the low-temperature phase of
CuIr2S4 has been already studied by diffraction experiments using a powder
sample, and it has been reported that the formation of dimer molecules
accompanied by charge ordering of Ir has been achieved. The crystal structure
of the low-temperature phase obtained in our reanalysis was the same as the
previously reported structure in that it showed the formation of Ir dimers
accompanied by charge ordering, but the charge ordering pattern and arrangement
of the dimers in the unit cell were different. We will discuss the validity of
the structure obtained in this study and provide the structural parameters
revealed in the reanalysis. The results of this study should provide a basis
for further studies of the physical properties of CuIr2S4, which are still
being actively investigated.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions with its topologically protected, nano-sized spin textures
have already earned immense fame as information carriers due to their stability
and low-current mobility. While ferromagnetic skyrmions suffer from a
transverse deflection (i.e., the skyrmion Hall effect), their
anti-ferromagnetic counterparts promise straight-line motion and ultrafast
dynamics. Here we present a numerical study of the dynamics of lattice-based
antiferromagnetic skyrmions driven by spin-transfer torque for which the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation is solved using a
fourth-order Range-Kutta integration. Then we conduct a detailed Monte Carlo
study of the two-dimensional classical XY model to quantify how spatial
anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) coupling reshape its thermal response
across multiple lattice sizes. By tuning the ratio Jy/Jx, we document a
systematic evolution of the specific-heat anomaly. For example, in the
quasi-one-dimensional limit, CV exhibits a broad, low-temperature hump, whereas
stronger anisotropy yields sharper peaks that migrate to higher inverse
temperature. Finite-size scaling confirms the crossover from quasi-1D
fluctuations to a two-dimensional Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Incorporating
a DM interaction further enriches this landscape. At D/J = 0.1, the main peak
shifts modestly upward and is slightly suppressed; raising D/J elevates the
peak magnitudes and creates a pronounced low-temperature plateau. This residual
CV signals enduring chiral excitations and complex spin-twist textures beyond
simple vortex unbinding. Our findings chart how directional and chiral
couplings can be harnessed to tune pseudo-critical temperatures and
thermodynamic signatures in two-dimensional magnets, providing a practical
blueprint for engineering topological spin systems.

Conclusion: 共振X射线衍射技术对解析复杂磁性结构具有重要潜力，EuPdSn2的磁性行为为相关研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The magnetic properties of materials hosting Eu2+(J = 7/2, 4f7) ions have
attracted much attention in the science of strongly correlated electrons. In
part because crystal electric field effects are impoverished for an s-state
ion, as with Gd3+ intermetallics, and Eu2+ substitution in biological and
optically active materials is resourceful. The magnetic structure of EuPdSn2 is
not wholly resolved. Ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic structures coexist in
powder neutron diffraction patterns, and compete in the ground state. Moreover,
the specific heat as a function of temperature is enigmatic and indicative of J
= 5/2. We present symmetry-informed analytic magnetic structure factors for
single crystal resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction using Eu atomic resonances that
reveal significant potential for the technique. Europium ions use acentric
Wyckoff positions in magnetic space groups inferred from neutron diffraction.
In consequence, axial and polar Eu multipoles are compulsory components of both
magnetic neutron and resonant x-ray Bragg diffraction patterns. The proposed
antiferromagnetic phase of EuPdSn2 supports anapoles (magnetic polar dipoles)
already observed in magnetic neutron diffraction patterns presented by Gd doped
SmAl2, and several resonant x-ray diffraction patterns.

InAs and we report notably the first observation of Shubnikov-de-Haas
oscillations in WTe$_{2}$ at magnetic fields beyond 100 T.

Abstract: Geometric frustration is a key ingredient in the emergence of exotic states
of matter, such as the quantum spin liquid in Mott insulators. While there has
been intense interest in experimentally tuning frustration in candidate
materials, achieving precise and continuous control has remained a major hurdle
-- particularly in accessing the properties of the ideally frustrated lattice.
Here, we show that large, finely controlled anisotropic strains can effectively
tune the degree of geometric frustration in the Mott insulating
$\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ -- a slightly anisotropic triangular-lattice
quantum magnet. Using thermodynamic measurements of the elastocaloric effect,
we experimentally map out a temperature-strain phase diagram that captures both
the ground state of the isotropic lattice and the less frustrated parent state.
Our results provide a new benchmark for calculations of the triangular-lattice
Hubbard model as a function of frustration and highlight the power of lattice
engineering as a route to realizing perfectly frustrated quantum materials.

Conclusion: 非线性碎片化是非阿贝尔SET相的标志，为拓扑量子计算中的对称性控制提供了新途径。

Abstract: Symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases combine intrinsic topological
order with global symmetries, giving rise to novel symmetry phenomena. While
SET phases with Abelian anyons are relatively well understood, those involving
non-Abelian anyons remain elusive. This obscurity stems from the
multi-dimensional internal gauge spaces intrinsic to non-Abelian anyons -- a
feature first made explicit in [1,2] and further explored and formalized in our
recent works [3-8]. These internal spaces can transform in highly nontrivial
ways under global symmetries. In this work, we employ an exactly solvable model
-- the multifusion Hu-Geer-Wu string-net model introduced in a companion paper
[9] -- to reveal how the internal gauge spaces of non-Abelian anyons transform
under symmetries. We uncover a universal mechanism, global symmetry
fragmentation (GSF), whereby symmetry-invariant anyons exhibit internal Hilbert
space decompositions into eigensubspaces labeled by generally fractional
symmetry charges. Meanwhile, symmetry-permuted anyons hybridize and fragment
their internal spaces in accordance with their symmetry behavior. These
fragmented structures realize genuinely nonlinear symmetry representations --
to be termed coherent representations -- that transcend conventional linear and
projective classifications, reflecting the categorical nature of symmetries in
topological phases. Our results identify nonlinear fragmentation as a hallmark
of non-Abelian SETs and suggest new routes for symmetry-enabled control in
topological quantum computation.

Conclusion: 相互作用本身的拓扑性质可阻碍平庸基态，扩展此类拓扑两体相互作用可能实现超越FCIs的奇异态。

Abstract: The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has
mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle
Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect
interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this
work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction
projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs.
Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the
two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between
the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation
allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the
two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological
effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily
based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact
that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the
realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is
consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the
fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From
another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the
interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in
the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body
interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetotransport properties of a diluted half-filled
one-band Hubbard model with second-nearest-neighbor hopping on a simple cubic
lattice, aiming to explore the possibility of metallicity in diluted
antiferromagnetic systems. Our semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) calculations
reveal an antiferromagnetic metallic regime in diluted correlated materials.
This unexpected metallic regime naturally leads to a central question: how does
the introduction of dilution into an antiferromagnetic material, especially
with long-range magnetic interactions, induce metallicity -- a feature not
commonly associated with antiferromagnets? To address this question, we
demonstrate that when the on-site repulsion strength ($U$) is set to zero on a
percentage of the sites (site dilution), the insulating state weakens due to
percolative conduction among the diluted sites at low temperatures. Remarkably,
this occurs without any significant alteration to the underlying long-range
antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering in the system, thereby providing a pathway to
realize antiferromagnetic metals. In addition, we show how the
sublattice-dependent hopping can be exploited to engineer spin-polarized
half-metallic antiferromagnets. Overall, our numerical results collectively
provide a basis for understanding the combined effect of site dilution and
competing interactions, which will assist in the design of new
antiferromagnetic metals for future spintronic applications.
