Even for the long-studied edge modes of\nquantum Hall phases, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional (2D) electron\nsystems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive.\nDespite advances made using local probes, key experimental challenges persist:\nthe lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on\nmicroscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here, we use scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM) to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum\nHall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how\ncorrelations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and\natomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau\nlevel, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the\nspatial profile for copropagating modes, and induce unexpected edge valley\npolarization that differ from those of the bulk. While some of our findings can\nbe understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture,\nhighlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We\nalso extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional\nquantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this\nchiral Luttinger liquid.

Due to a\nstrong electron-electron interaction, dramatic rearrangements of the charge\ndensity distribution and the potential landscape in the wire occur at a\nsufficiently high DC bias voltage. The applied voltage is screened mainly near\nthe cathode contact, and an almost flat potential profile is established in the\nmost of the wire. Thus, the size of the region of a population inversion of\nelectronic states greatly increases, and the band of wave vectors that form\nunstable modes of electronic waves significantly reduces. As a result, the\nconditions for the occurrence of the time-of-flight instability are greatly\nfacilitated and the negative dynamic conductivity increases."}

We propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-microwave\ncontrolled-Z (CZ) gate that achieves high fidelity while suppressing residual\nZZ interactions. Our approach utilizes a fixed-frequency transmon coupler and\nmulti-path coupling, thereby sufficiently reducing the net transverse\ninteraction between data transmons to suppress residual ZZ interactions. The\ncontrolled phase arises from the dispersive frequency shift of the $\\fggetxt$\ntransition between the coupler and one of the data transmons conditioned on the\nstate of the other data transmon. Driving the transitions at the midpoint of\ntwo dispersively shifted resonance frequencies induces state-dependent\ngeometric phases to achieve the CZ gate. Crucially, with this scheme, we can\nmaintain a small net transverse interaction between two data transmons while\nincreasing the coupling between the data and coupler transmons to accelerate\nthe CZ-gate speed. Additionally, we measure the coupler state after the gate to\ndetect a subset of decoherence-induced failures that occur during the gate\noperation. These events constitute erasure errors with known locations,\nenabling erasure-aware quantum error-correcting codes to improve future logical\nqubit performance."}

Traditionally, computed values have been equated with\nground states. This paper generalizes computation with ground states to\ncomputation with spin averages, allowing computations to take place at high\ntemperatures. It then introduces a systematic correspondence between Ising\ndevices and neural networks and a simple method to run trained feed-forward\nneural networks on Ising-type hardware. Finally, a mathematical proof is\noffered that these implementations are always successful."}

While significant progresses have been\nachieved in the past two decades in searching for these exotic excitations in\nsolid-state systems, their non-Abelian nature remains unverified, as definitive\nproof requires braiding operations. Here, we report preliminarily experimental\nadvances in creating, manipulating, and exchanging the presumed Majorana zero\nmodes in an envelope-shaped Josephson device composed of multiple trijunctions\non a topological insulator surface. We observed the signatures of in-gap states\nmigration consistent with the expectations of the Fu-Kane model, supporting the\nrealization of an exchange operation.

From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities,\nsuch as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum.\nHowever, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the\nBisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field\ntheories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz\ninvariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the\nlattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte\nCarlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in\ntwo-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems\nwithout translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the\nprimordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped\nand gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or\ncontinuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility\nof our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find\nthat when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from\nsurface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well\nbeyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework\nfor investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum\nmany-body systems."}

In this work, we utilize a sudden quench\napproximation as a means to investigate the operation of a quantum\nthermodynamic Otto cycle in which multiple parameters are simultaneously\ncontrollable. The method applies universally to many-body systems where such\ncontrol is available, and therefore provides general principles for\ninvestigating their operation as a working medium in quantum thermal machines.\nWe investigate application of this multi-parameter quench protocol in an\nexperimentally realistic one-dimensional Bose gas as the working fluid, with\ncontrol over both the frequency of an external harmonic trap and the\ninterparticle interaction strength. We derive a general inequality for the net\nwork of this two-parameter Otto cycle, demonstrating that this protocol\nout-performs its constituent single-parameter Otto cycles when operating as an\nengine, and additionally implying an enhancement to the coefficient of\nperformance when operating as a refrigerator. Further, we demonstrate that\nmulti-parameter control can exhibit dramatically improved performance of the\nOtto engine when compared not only to single-parameter constituent quenches but\nalso to the combined effect of its constituent engine cycles."}

In this Letter, we develop a microscopic quantum\nframework that captures the spatial structure of polaritonic modes. In a\nhomogeneously filled cavity, spatial overlap between polaritons and cavity\nresonances enforces selection rules that suppress the initially reported\npolaritonic Raman peaks, consistent with most experiments. In contrast, for a\nquasi-two-dimensional (2d) molecular layer, these rules are lifted, yielding\nRaman peaks at the polariton energies. Our work clarifies that the Raman\nresponse under vibrational strong coupling is determined by cavity-vibration\nspatial mode overlap and offers a framework for Raman studies of strongly\ncoupled quasi-2d systems."}
