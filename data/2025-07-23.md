### [1] [Quantum Complementarity ad Infinitum: Switching Higher-Order Coherence from Infinity to Zero](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15890)
*Arash Azizi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文展示了量子互补性在‘Janus态’高阶光子统计中的表现，该态作为多光子关联的完美量子开关，通过路径信息调控实现量子干涉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子互补性在多光子统计中的表现，并研究如何通过调控路径信息实现量子干涉。

Method: 使用‘Janus态’（两个压缩真空的相干叠加）作为研究对象，分析其高阶光子统计特性，并通过理论和数值模拟验证结果。

Result: 发现该态可以作为多光子关联的量子开关，通过路径信息调控实现高阶关联的完全抑制（g^(k)≥3趋近于零）。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子互补性在多光子统计中的基础性演示提供了新范式，展示了如何从高斯资源中产生高度有序的非经典光。

Abstract: We report a profound manifestation of quantum complementarity in the
higher-order photon statistics of the ``Janus state,'' a coherent superposition
of two squeezed vacua. We find that the state acts as a perfect quantum switch
for multi-photon correlations, toggled by the availability of which-path
information. Erasing this information activates quantum interference that can
be tuned to be maximally destructive. This reveals a remarkable hierarchy of
suppression: while two-photon correlations remain finite, we prove analytically
and demonstrate numerically that it is possible to drive all higher-order
correlations ($g^{(k)}$ for $k \ge 3$) to zero. This transition from the
extreme bunching of the constituent states ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to a state of
profound quantum order is visualized by the emergence of negativity in the
state's Wigner function, an unambiguous signature of non-classicality. This
work provides a foundational demonstration of quantum complementarity in
multi-photon statistics and introduces a new paradigm for engineering highly
ordered, non-classical light from Gaussian resources.

### [2] [Coarse-Grained Quantum Thermodynamics: Observation-Dependent Quantities, Observation-Independent Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15918)
*Giulia Rubino,Časlav Brukner,Gonzalo Manzano*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了量子热力学中物理量的观测依赖性，发现粗粒度与细粒度定义下结论可能不同，但热力学关系仍成立。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑传统热力学中物理量的客观性定义，研究实验仪器精度如何影响关键热力学量的定义。

Method: 分析粗粒度和细粒度定义下的热力学量，比较其结论差异，并验证热力学关系是否仍成立。

Result: 粗粒度定义下的热力学量可能导致不同结论（如不可逆性或功输出），但热力学关系（如第二定律）仍保持。

Conclusion: 热力学关系具有观测独立性，但热力学量本身可能依赖观测精度。

Abstract: In both classical and quantum thermodynamics, physical quantities are
typically assigned objective values defined independently of our observations.
We then refer to the 'work performed by a gas', or the 'entropy of the gas',
regardless of how they are evaluated. Here, we question this conception in the
context of quantum thermodynamics, estimating how the definition of pivotal
thermodynamic quantities is affected by experimental instruments of limited
precision. We find that the coarse-grained thermodynamic quantities frequently
lead to different conclusions from those drawn in fine-grained scenarios. For
instance, the irreversibility of a process, or its work payoff, can
significantly vary with the instrument precision. We show nonetheless that
coarse-grained thermodynamic quantities satisfy the same relations (i.e., the
second law inequality, the relation between dissipation and distinguishability
of a process from its time-reverse, and the quantum work fluctuation theorems)
as their fine-grained counterparts. These results highlight the
observation-independence of relations linking thermodynamic quantities which
are themselves observation-dependent.

### [3] [Relaxation control of open quantum systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15948)
*Nicolò Beato,Gianluca Teza*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种控制开放量子系统稳态收敛的方法，通过构造抵消特定弛豫模式的幺正操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放量子系统实验中稳态收敛时间窗口的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子模拟器中稳态控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in experiments with open quantum systems is to ensure
steady-state convergence within a given operational time window. Here, we
devise a general state preparation recipe to control relaxation timescales and
achieve steady-state convergence within experimental run times. We do so by
constructing a unitary operation that cancels the desired relaxation modes. We
provide an example in a few-body interacting system (long-range qubit chain),
taking into account limitations of experimentally accessible unitary operations
in quantum simulators.

### [4] [Topological control of quantum speed limits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15950)
*Alexander Kruchkov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a measure quantifying the sensitivity of
a quantum state with respect to changes in tuning parameters in quantum
metrology, and defining quantum speed limits. We show that even if the quantum
state is completely dispersionless, QFI in this state remains
momentum-resolved. We compute the QFI for topological phases at integer filling
and demonstrate that each momentum-resolved term is fundamentally bounded by
quantum geometric and topological invariants, with maximum QFI controlled by
topological invariants (Chern number $|C|$). We also finds bounds on quantum
speed limit which scales as $\sqrt{|C|}$ in a (dispersionless) topological
phase. We conclude that quantum platforms of high Chern numbers $|C| \gg 1$,
such as those featuring twisted multilayered van der Waals heterostructures,
significantly enhance capacity for quantum Fisher information, and provide
practical control over quantum speed limits.

Method: 利用FMPS框架模拟连续变量量子电路，明确建模有限挤压引起的相干误差源，进行5至15 dB挤压水平的随机基准测试。

Result: 在高挤压水平下，模拟结果与GKP量子比特的解析估计高度一致，并发现10 dB挤压阈值，超过该阈值时Grover算法优于经典概率界限。

Conclusion: FMPS框架成功模拟了GKP量子比特的测量量子计算，验证了挤压阈值对算法性能的关键影响。

Abstract: We present the first detailed simulation of a measurement based quantum
computation based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits within a quad-rail
lattice (QRL) cluster state involving over 100 GKP modes. This was enabled by
the recently developed functional matrix product states (FMPS) framework, with
which we simulate continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits while explicitly
modelling intrinsic coherent error sources due to finite squeezing. We perform
simulated randomised benchmarking across squeezing levels between 5 and 15 dB
and find strong agreement with analytical estimates for high quality GKP
qubits. As a demonstration of practical computation, we simulate a three-qubit
Grover's algorithm within the QRL and identify a fundamental squeezing
threshold -- approximately 10 dB -- beyond which the algorithm outperforms
classical probability bounds.

Abstract: This short note shows that the recently proposed generating function for loop
hafnians -- originally derived using quantum-optical methods for a restricted
class of matrices -- is in fact valid for arbitrary symmetric matrices. The
proof relies solely on Gaussian integration and does not assume any additional
properties inherited from the covariance matrices of quantum Gaussian states.

### [7] [Tunneling driven by quantum light described via field Bohmian trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15972)

Abstract: Recent realization of an intense quantum light, namely bright squeezed
vacuum, opened a new perspective on quantum light-matter interaction. Several
theoretical works have appeared based on coherent state expansions of quantum
state of light to investigate non-classical driving of high-harmonic generation
in atomic gases and solids, or free-electron dynamics, but their predictions
surprisingly coincide with what one could expect from essentially classical
interpretations of the light statistics. A deeper theoretical insight into the
underlying physics is necessary for understanding of observed experimental
findings and predicting emerging effects relying on this new configuration.
Here we present a theoretical framework to describe tunneling driven by quantum
light, where the properties of such light are captured by a statistical
ensemble of classical fields via a hydrodynamic, also referred to as Bohmian,
formulation. Generalizing the quasiclassical theory of non-adiabatic tunneling
driven by classical light, a single tunneling event is described by a bundle of
tunneling solutions, each driven by a classical field corresponding to one
realization in the ensemble. Quantum statistics of light are thus imprinted on
the measured current. Fully quantum description of light via the Bohmian
trajectories of its field provides a perfect fit to the description of the
electron (under-) above-barrier dynamics in terms of (complex quasiclassical)
real classical trajectories, resulting in a consistent and elegant theoretical
approach. To illustrate this, we consider BSV-induced electron transport from
the tip to the surface in the tunneling microscope configuration demonstrating
the transition from the multiphoton to the direct tunneling regime.

Result: 数值实验支持了所提方法的有效性，表明其能显著减少量子行走模拟所需的量子比特数量。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子设备上高效模拟量子行走提供了新途径，有助于减少资源消耗。

Abstract: Quantum random walks represent a powerful tool for the implementation of
various quantum algorithms. We consider a convolution problem for the graphs
which provide quantum and classical random walks. We suggest a new method for
lattices and hypercycle convolution that preserves quantum walk dynamics. Our
method is based on the fact that some graphs represent a result of Kronecker's
product of line graphs. We support our methods by means of various numerical
experiments that check quantum and classical random walks on hypercycles and
their convolutions. Our findings may be useful for saving a significant number
of qubits required for algorithms that use quantum walk simulation on quantum
devices.

### [9] [Towards a pulse-level intermediate representation for diverse quantum control systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15995)
*Jude Alnas,Aniket S. Dalvi,Kenneth R. Brown*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: pulselib作为量子控制系统的中间表示（IR），通过图基IR和转译管道实现跨平台量子软件快速开发与重用，性能接近设备专用IR，且在某些情况下速度提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种系统无关的中间表示（IR）以支持量子控制系统的跨平台脉冲级编程，促进量子软件的快速开发和重用。

Method: 采用基于图的IR和转译管道，引入munchers（编码目标特定约束）和可参数化脉冲调度（支持调度重用）。

Result: pulselib性能接近设备专用IR，速度提升达4.5倍；对于高度参数化应用，转译时间随参数数量增长更优，速度提升可达69%。

Conclusion: pulselib是一种高效的跨平台量子控制IR，兼具性能与灵活性。

Abstract: A system-independent intermediate representation (IR) for pulse-level
programming of quantum control systems is required to enable rapid development
and reuse of quantum software across diverse platforms. In this work, we
demonstrate the utility of pulselib as a candidate for such an IR. We implement
graph-based IRs and transpilation pipelines for two unique frequency
synthesizers and benchmark performance against existing IRs. Key elements of
these pipelines are munchers and parametrizable pulse schedules. The former
encodes target-specific constraints and allows translation of fundamentally
system-agnostic pulse descriptions to arbitrary low-level representations, and
the latter enables schedule reuse that produces savings in transpilation time
relative to device-specific alternatives. Benchmarks reveal that pulselib
provides performance comparable to fast, device-specific IRs while providing a
speedup of up to 4.5x over existing IRs. For highly parametrized applications,
pulselib provides favorable scaling of transpilation times with respect to the
number of parameters and can exhibit speedups relative to existing IRs up to
69% larger than speedups provided by optimized, device-specific techniques.

### [10] [Automated Design of Structured Variational Quantum Circuits with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16001)
*Gloria Turati,Simone Foderà,Riccardo Nembrini,Maurizio Ferrari Dacrema,Paolo Cremonesi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于强化学习的变分量子电路设计方法（RLVQC Block和RLVQC Global），用于组合优化问题，结果显示RLVQC Block性能优于QAOA和RLVQC Global，而RLVQC Global能生成更短电路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分量子算法（VQAs）在近期量子硬件中具有潜力，但其效果依赖于启发式设计的电路结构。本文旨在通过强化学习优化电路设计。

Method: 将变分量子电路合成建模为顺序决策问题，使用PPO算法，提出RLVQC Block（推广QAOA结构）和RLVQC Global（无约束结构）两种方法。

Result: RLVQC Block在QUBO实例中表现优于QAOA和RLVQC Global，而RLVQC Global能生成更短电路。

Conclusion: 强化学习可有效发现针对特定问题的电路结构，最佳设计策略介于预定义结构和完全无约束结构之间。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising approaches
for leveraging near-term quantum hardware, yet their effectiveness strongly
depends on the design of the underlying circuit ansatz, which is typically
constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of
variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where
gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we
introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC
Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates
ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA),
by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit
pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates
unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt
the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement
outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed
methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based
optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong
results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally
surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth
comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly
shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be
an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific
problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid
predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a
favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自由空间Sagnac干涉仪的偏振编码器，用于单光子量子比特的高速信息编码，实现了0.69(2)%的量子比特错误率，是目前最低的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子通信和基于测量的光子量子计算等量子应用需要高速、低错误率的单光子信息编码技术，而现有技术对环境干扰敏感，限制了实际应用中的错误率。

Abstract: The ability to inscribe information on single photons at high speeds is a
crucial requirement for quantum applications such as quantum communication and
measurement-based photonic quantum computation. Nowadays, most experimental
implementations employ phase modulators in single-pass, Mach-Zehnder
interferometer or Michelson interferometer configurations to encode information
on photonic qubits. However, these approaches are intrinsically sensitive to
environmental influences, limiting the achievable quantum error rates in
practice. We report on the first demonstration of a polarization encoder for
single-photon qubits based on a free-space Sagnac interferometer, showcasing
inherent phase stability and overcoming previous error rate limitations.
Telecom-wavelength single photons emitted by a quantum dot are modulated by the
encoder under a repetition rate of 152 MHz. A quantum bit error rate of
0.69(2)% is achieved, marking the lowest error rate reported to date for
high-speed information encoding on single photons. This work represents a key
advance towards robust, scalable, and low-error quantum information processing
with single photon sources.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的量子退火小嵌入方法，使用PPO代理，测试其在Chimera和Zephyr硬件拓扑上的表现，结果表明该方法能有效生成小嵌入并适应不同图结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子退火中的小嵌入过程计算成本高且难以扩展，现有启发式方法通用性差，强化学习提供了一种灵活的替代方案。

Result: 代理在Chimera和Zephyr拓扑上均能生成有效的小嵌入，尤其在Zephyr拓扑上表现更优，且能适应不同图结构。

Conclusion: 强化学习作为一种灵活通用的框架，在量子退火小嵌入中具有潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving
combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor
embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum
processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with
increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often
developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult
to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by
treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an
agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem
variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor
embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to
embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two
hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent
consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number
of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed
approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to
different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and
general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.

Abstract: Chiral coupling opens new avenues for controlling and exploiting light-matter
interactions. We demonstrate that chiral coupling can be utilized to achieve
unidirectional perfect absorption. In our experiments, chiral magnon-photon
coupling is realized by coupling the magnon modes in yttrium iron garnet (YIG)
spheres with spin-momentum-locked waveguide modes supported by spoof surface
plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). These photon modes exhibit transverse spin, with
the spin direction determined by the propagation direction. Due to the
intrinsic spin properties of the magnon mode, it exclusively couples with
microwaves traveling in one direction, effectively suppressing the reflection
channel. Under the critical coupling condition, transmission is also
eliminated, resulting in unidirectional perfect absorption. By incorporating
additional YIG spheres, bidirectional and multi-frequency perfect absorption
can be achieved. Our work introduces a novel platform for exploring and
harnessing chiral light-matter interactions within spin-momentum locked
devices, offering a paradigm for unidirectional signal processing and energy
harvesting technologies.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the feasibility of Schr{\"o}dinger cat (SC) and
$N00N$ states formation by a convenient bosonic Josephson junction (BJJ) system
in two-mode approximation. Starting with purely quantum description of two-mode
Bose-Einstein condensate we investigate the effective potential approach that
provides an accurate analytical description for the system with a large number
of particles. We show that in the zero temperature limit SC states result from
a quantum phase transition that occurs when the nonlinear strength becomes
comparable with the Josephson coupling parameter. The Wigner function approach
demonstrates the growth of the SC state halves separation and formation of
$N00N$-like states (a Fock state superposition) with the particle number
increase. We examine the possibility to attain the SC state at finite
temperatures and a weak dissipation leading to appearing of some critical
temperature; it defines the second-order phase transition from classical
activation process to the SC state formation through the quantum tunneling
phenomenon. Numerical estimations demonstrate that the critical temperature is
sufficiently below the temperature of atomic condensation. The results obtained
may be useful for experimental observation of SC states with small condensate
Josephson junctions.

Conclusion: 改进的分区方法和粗化技术有效解决了分布式量子计算中的网络连接问题，提高了性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Quantum computers face inherent scaling challenges, a fact that necessitates
investigation of distributed quantum computing systems, whereby scaling is
achieved through interconnection of smaller quantum processing units. However,
connecting large numbers of QPUs will eventually result in connectivity
constraints at the network level, where the difficulty of entanglement sharing
increases with network path lengths. This increases the complexity of the
quantum circuit partitioning problem, since the cost of generating entanglement
between end nodes varies with network topologies and existing links. We address
this challenge using a simple modification to existing partitioning schemes
designed for all-to-all connected networks, that efficiently accounts for both
of these factors. We investigate the performance in terms of entanglement
requirements and optimisation time of various quantum circuits over different
network topologies, achieving lower entanglement costs in the majority of cases
than state-of-the-art methods. We provide techniques for scaling to large-scale
quantum networks employing both network and problem coarsening. We show that
coarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with
significantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods.

Motivation: 研究量子通道中异常点的存在与性质，填补了开放量子系统中EPs研究的空白。

Result: 成功验证了二阶和三阶EPs的存在，展示了量子通道插值作为生成EPs的通用框架。

Conclusion: 量子通道插值为开放量子系统中EPs的研究提供了通用描述和实现方法。

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are special points in non-Hermitian systems where
both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. In open quantum systems, these
points are typically analyzed using effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or
Liouvillian superoperators. While quantum channels offer the most general
framework for describing state evolution in such systems, the existence and
properties of EPs within this setting remain largely unexplored. In this work,
we present a general strategy for generating quantum EPs for a single-qubit
setting. We show that quantum channels can be separated into two distinct
phases, with the transition between them marked by the presence of an EP. Based
on this, we propose a systematic method to realize EPs by interpolating between
quantum channels representing different phases. Experimentally, we implement
these interpolated channels on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum
computer and confirm the emergence of second-order EPs with high fidelity.
Extending the interpolation to three channels further reveals third-order EPs.
Our results establish quantum channel interpolation as a versatile framework
for generating EPs and provide a general description of EPs in open quantum
systems.

Abstract: Interfacing superconducting microwave resonators with optical systems enables
sensitive photon detectors, quantum transducers, and related quantum
technologies. Achieving high optical pulse repetition is crucial for maximizing
the device throughput. However, light-induced deterioration, such as
quasiparticle poisoning, pair-breaking-phonon generation, and elevated
temperature, hinders the rapid recovery of superconducting circuits, limiting
their ability to sustain high optical pulse repetition rates. Understanding
these loss mechanisms and enabling fast circuit recovery are therefore
critical. In this work, we investigate the impact of optical illumination on
niobium nitride and niobium microwave resonators by immersing them in
superfluid helium-4 and demonstrate a three-order-of-magnitude faster resonance
recovery compared to vacuum. By analyzing transient resonance responses, we
provide insights into light-induced dynamics in these superconductors,
highlighting the advantages of niobium-based superconductors and superfluid
helium for rapid circuit recovery in superconducting quantum systems integrated
with optical fields.

symmetric states representing (3+1)D symmetry protected topological phases.
Although aspects of these constructions have been previously addressed, our
contribution unifies them within a single tensor network framework and
emphasizes the explicit formulation of local tensor equations encoding global
consistency conditions.

*Xing M. Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了爱因斯坦1927年的电子衍射思想实验，利用现代传感器实现单电子源和不透明半球探测器阵列，直接比较多世界解释（MWI）和分支希尔伯特子空间解释（BHSI）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过实验比较MWI和BHSI这两种保持幺正性但不涉及波函数坍缩的解释，探讨量子事件的分支动力学。

Method: 使用全封闭系统（无信号逃逸）和双层探测器设置（内层透明），通过电子传输时间短于探测器响应时间来测试分支动态。

Result: 实验支持局部、幺正分支而非全局平行世界的观点，Born规则通过分支权重自然显现。

Conclusion: 挑战了幺正性必须伴随平行世界的观点，提出更简单的局部分支解释。

Abstract: We revisit the 1927 thought experiment of Einstein on electron diffraction,
using a single-electron source and an opaque hemispheric detector array, now
achievable with modern sensors. In this fully enclosed system, where no signals
escape the hemisphere, we provide a direct empirical comparison of the
Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) and the Branched Hilbert Subspace
Interpretation (BHSI). Both maintain unitarity without invoking wavefunction
collapse, as in the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), but differ ontologically:
MWI proposes irreversible global branching into parallel worlds, while BHSI
describes local, potentially reversible branching into decohered subspaces. In
this setup, all quantum events (branching, engagement, disengagement, and
relocation) occur entirely within the local system, and the Born rule,
naturally emerging through branch weights, can be observed in detector
statistics. To explore branching dynamics more thoroughly, we suggest an
enhanced dual-layer experimental setup with an inner transparent detector.
Because the electron transit time between layers is shorter than the average
response times of the inner sensors, this allows for a crucial test of
measurement timing and potential anomalies, such as delayed or uncommitted
choices. Our analysis challenges the notion that unitarity necessitates
parallel worlds, instead advocating for a simpler view: local, unitary
branching without collapse or global splitting.

Abstract: Quantum Zeno dragging enables the preparation of common eigenstates of a set
of observables by frequent measurement and adiabatic-like modulation of the
measurement basis. In this work, we present a deeper analysis of multi-channel
Zeno dragging using generalized measurements, i.e. simultaneously measuring a
set of non-commuting observables that vary slowly in time, to drag the state
towards a target subspace. For concreteness, we will focus on a
measurement-driven approach to solving k-SAT problems as examples. We first
compute some analytical upper bounds on the convergence time, including the
effect of finite measurement time resolution. We then apply optimal control
theory to obtain the optimal dragging schedule that lower bounds the
convergence time, for low-dimensional settings. This study provides a
theoretical foundation for multi-channel Zeno dragging and its optimization,
and also serves as a guide for designing optimal dragging schedules for quantum
information tasks including measurement-driven quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Fusion-based quantum computing is an attractive model for fault-tolerant
computation based on photonics requiring only finite-sized entangled resource
states followed by linear-optics operations and photon measurements.
Large-scale implementations have so far been limited due to the access only to
probabilistic photon sources, vulnerability to photon loss, and the need for
massive multiplexing. Deterministic photon sources offer an alternative and
resource-efficient route. By synergistically integrating deterministic photon
emission, adaptive repeat-until-success fusions, and an optimised architectural
design, we propose a complete blueprint for a photonic quantum computer using
quantum dots and linear optics. It features time-bin qubit encoding,
reconfigurable entangled-photon sources, and a fusion-based architecture with
low optical connectivity, significantly reducing the required optical depth per
photon and resource overheads. We present in detail the hardware required for
resource-state generation and fusion networking, experimental pulse sequences,
and exact resource estimates for preparing a logical qubit. We estimate that
one logical clock cycle of error correction can be executed within
microseconds, which scales linearly with the code distance. We also simulate
error thresholds for fault-tolerance by accounting for a full catalogue of
intrinsic error sources found in real-world quantum dot devices. Our work
establishes a practical blueprint for a low-optical-depth, emitter-based
fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer.

Abstract: Hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers poses a
severe security threat, allowing adversaries to induce targeted errors across
tenant boundaries by injecting carefully engineered pulses. We present a
simulation-based study of active crosstalk attacks at the pulse level,
analyzing how adversarial control of pulse timing, shape, amplitude, and
coupling can disrupt a victim's computation. Our framework models the
time-dependent dynamics of a three-qubit system in the rotating frame,
capturing both always-on couplings and injected drive pulses. We examine two
attack strategies: attacker-first (pulse before victim operation) and
victim-first (pulse after), and systematically identify the pulse and coupling
configurations that cause the largest logical errors. Protocol-level
experiments on quantum coin flip and XOR classification circuits show that some
protocols are highly vulnerable to these attacks, while others remain robust.
Based on these findings, we discuss practical methods for detection and
mitigation to improve security in quantum cloud platforms.

Result: 工具提供了对量子比特状态的深入洞察，提高了调试的可靠性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了CUDA-Q的可用性空白，为量子软件开发提供了更高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As quantum computing continues to mature, more developers are designing,
coding, and simulating quantum circuits. A challenge exists, however, in
debugging quantum circuits, particularly as they scale in size and complexity.
Given the lack of effective debugging workflows, developers are forced to
manually inspect their circuits and analyze various quantum states, which is
error-prone and time-consuming.
  In this research, we present a statistical assertion-based debugging workflow
for CUDA-Q. CUDA-Q has gained popularity due to its ability to leverage GPUs to
accelerate quantum circuit simulations; this allows circuits to scale to larger
depths and widths, where they can be particularly hard to debug by hand.
Inspired by and building from prior Qiskit-based debuggers, our work allows
CUDA-Q users to verify quantum program correctness with greater ease. Through
the insertion of statistical assertions within a quantum circuit, our tool
provides valuable insights into the state of qubits at any point within a
circuit, tracks their evolution, and helps detect deviations from expected
behavior. Furthermore, we improve the reliability and accuracy of the product
state assertion by using a combination of Fisher's exact test and the Monte
Carlo Method instead of a chi-square test, and examine the impact of CUDA-Q's
distinct kernel-based programming model on the design of our debugging tool.
This work offers a practical solution to one of CUDA-Q's usability gaps, paving
the way for more reliable and efficient quantum software development.

Abstract: Engineering quantum bath networks through non-Hermitian subsystem
Hamiltonians has recently emerged as a promising strategy for qubit cooling,
state stabilization, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, scaling
these systems while maintaining precise control over their complex
interconnections, especially in the optical domain, poses significant
challenges in both theoretical modeling and physical implementation. In this
work, drawing on principles from quantum and mathematical physics, we introduce
a systematic framework for constructing non-Hermitian subsystems within
entirely Hermitian photonic platforms. In particular, controlled exponential
decay without actual absorption loss is realized in finite 1-D waveguide chains
through discrete-to-continuum coupling and Lanczos transformations. Using this
new methodology, we implement parity-time symmetric quantum systems and
experimentally demonstrate that these artificial bath environments accurately
replicate the dynamics of non-Hermitian arrangements in both single- and
multi-photon excitation regimes. Since the non-Hermitian subsystem response
deterministically arises from an artificially built Hermitian bath, the quantum
evolution can be monitored via post-selection in this fully conservative
configuration. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and
experimental realizations, thus paving the way for exploiting quantum bath
engineering in advanced information processing and emerging quantum
technologies.

Abstract: In the present work we propose a novel quantum material concept, which
enables super- and/or ultrastrong interaction of two-level systems with the
photonic field in a complex network. Within the mean field approximation we
examine phase transition to superradiance that results in two excitation
(polariton) branches and is accompanied by the appearance of non-zero
macroscopic polarization of two-level systems. We characterize the statistical
properties of networks by the first, ${\langle}k{\rangle}$, and second
normalized, $\zeta\equiv{\langle}k^2{\rangle}/{\langle}k{\rangle}$, moments for
node degree distribution. We have shown that the Rabi frequency is essentially
enhanced due to the topology of the network within the anomalous domain where
${\langle}k{\rangle}$ and $\zeta$ sufficiently grow. The multichannel
(multimode) structure of matter-field interaction leads superstrong coupling
that provides primary behavior of the high temperature phase transition. The
results obtained pave the way to design new photonic and polaritonic circuits,
quantum networks for efficient processing quantum information at high (room)
temperatures.

Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum
computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum
systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum
Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem
driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms:
Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT
(NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized
Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT
utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum
classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over
training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We
validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the
2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal
state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our
meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve
as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random
initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring
example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature
crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum
Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms,
achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a
30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum
imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and
practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits play a key role in quantum computing.
Measuring the suitability of such a circuit for solving a class of problems is
needed. One such promising measure is the expressivity of a circuit, which is
defined in two main variants. The variant in focus of this contribution is the
so-called dimensional expressivity which measures the dimension of the
submanifold of states produced by the circuit. Understanding this measure needs
a lot of background from differential topology which makes it hard to
comprehend. In this article we provide this background in a vivid as well as
pedagogical manner. Especially it strives towards being self-contained for
understanding expressivity, e.g. the required mathematical foundations are
provided and examples are given. Also, the literature makes several statements
about expressivity the proofs of which are omitted or only indicated. In this
article we give proofs for key statements from dimensional expressivity,
sometimes revealing limits for generalizing them, and also sketching how to
proceed in practice to determine this measure.

Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) have been predominantly driven by discrete-variable
(DV) architectures. Yet, many optical platforms naturally generate Gaussian
states--the common states of continuous-variable (CV) systems, making CV-based
QNs an attractive route toward scalable, chip-integrated quantum computation
and communication. To bridge the conceptual gap between well-studied DV
entanglement percolation theories and their CV counterpart, we introduce a
Gaussian-to-Gaussian entanglement distribution scheme that deterministically
transports two-mode squeezed vacuum states across large CV networks. Analysis
of the scheme's collective behavior using statistical-physics methods reveals a
new form of entanglement percolation--negativity percolation theory
(NegPT)--characterized by a bounded entanglement measure called the ratio
negativity. We discover that NegPT exhibits a mixed-order phase transition,
marked simultaneously by both an abrupt change in global entanglement and a
long-range correlation between nodes. This distinctive behavior places CV-based
QNs in a new universality class, fundamentally distinct from DV systems.
Additionally, the abruptness of this transition introduces a critical
vulnerability of CV-based QNs: conventional feedback mechanism becomes
inherently unstable near the threshold, highlighting practical implications for
stabilizing large-scale CV-based QNs. Our results not only unify statistical
models for CV-based entanglement distribution but also uncover previously
unexplored critical phenomena unique to CV systems, providing valuable insights
and guidelines essential for developing robust, feedback-stabilized QNs.

Abstract: Topological materials, known for their edge states robust against local
perturbations, hold promise for next-generation quantum technologies, but
remain scarce in nature and challenging to realize in static systems. The
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is a one-dimensional system for topological phases,
although its static control is limited. To overcome these limitations, we
propose to use high-frequency monochromatic driving and modulated amplitude
pulses to dynamically induce and switch the Floquet topological phases. Using a
Kramers-Henneberger-like transformation, we encode all Floquet sidebands into a
single effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that both monochromatic and
experimental pulse protocols (Gaussian and fast-beating envelopes) can induce
topological edge states, enabling dynamic phase switching. Notably,
fast-beating modulations require significantly lower field strengths than
monochromatic ones, especially with larger inter-dimer separations. Our
findings offer an experimentally feasible route for Floquet engineering, paving
the way for ultrafast and energy efficient control of topological phases in
quantum platforms, opening up new possibilities in the field of dynamic quantum
materials.

showcases how the providers and various technologies differ and presents
results in the relative efficiency of exemplary quantum algorithms on neutral
atom-based, ion trap and superconducting hardware, the latter including both

Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable
precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and
electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the
limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and
measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires
optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum
sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum
circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum
channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are
typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning
criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian
inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active
information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for
non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step,
and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum
sensing agents.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a technique in quantum information science used
to reconstruct the density matrix of an unknown quantum state, providing
complete information about the quantum state. It is of significant importance
in fields such as quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum
simulation. However, as the size of the quantum system increases, the number of
measurement settings and sampling requirements for quantum state tomography
grow exponentially with the number of qubits. This not only makes experimental
design and implementation more complex, but also exacerbates the consumption of
experimental resources. These limitations severely hinder the application of
state tomography in large-scale quantum systems. To reduce measurement settings
and improve sampling efficiency, this study proposes a state tomography method
based on auxiliary systems. This method can be implemented through either
entanglement between the quantum system to be measured and a quantum auxiliary
system or through correlation between the quantum system and a probabilistic
classical auxiliary system. Measurements on the entire joint system enable more
efficient extraction of information about the quantum state to be measured.
This method relies on standard quantum gate operations and requires only two
measurement settings, with a total sampling complexity of $O(d^2)$,
significantly simplifying experimental operations and measurement processes.
Additionally, this study provides two schemes for measuring purity based on the
proposed circuit, one of which achieves measurement precision at the Heisenberg
limit. This study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method through a
detailed theoretical analysis, a series of numerical simulations, and
experiments.

Abstract: While superiority of quantum over classical computation has been established,
the repertoire of primitives with proven or conjectured quantum advantage
remains limited. Despite considerable progress in delineating the
quantumclassical divide, the systematic construction of algorithms with quantum
advantage remains challenging, which can be attributed to a still incomplete
understanding of the sources of quantum computational power. While intermediate
non-stabiliserness (i.e., traversal of states outside the Clifford orbit)
indicates necessary non-classical behaviour for quantum advantage, naively
equating non-stabiliserness and non-classicality is misguided: Even random Haar
sampled states exhibit near-maximal non-stabiliserness. Advancing towards
quantum advantage calls for a better understanding of the efficient use of
non-stabiliser states. We present an approach to track the behaviour of
non-stabiliserness across various algorithms by pairing resource theory of
non-stabiliser entropies with the geometry of quantum state evolution, and
introduce permutation agnostic distance measures that reveal non-stabiliser
effects previously hidden by a subset of Clifford operations. We find different
efficiency in the use of non-stabiliserness for structured and unstructured
variational approaches, and show that greater freedom for classical
optimisation in quantum-classical methods increases unnecessary non-stabiliser
consumption. Our results open new means of analysing the efficient utilisation
of quantum resources, and contribute towards the targeted construction of
algorithmic quantum advantage.

Abstract: Maxwell's equations in the vacuum can be formally cast in the form of
Schr\"odinger's equation. Unfortunately, the vector to which this equation
directly applies is not a wavefunction: its amplitude squared is not a
probability density but the expected energy density of the field. Since we can
count photons, there must be a more convincing wavefunction, derived from the
EM field, whose amplitude squared is an expected photon density. Mandel
proposed the second quantized version of such a wavefunction, but did not link
it directly to the EM field. We show how this can be accomplished.

Abstract: We propose an efficient protocol to realize multi-qubit gates in arrays of
neutral atoms. The atoms encode qubits in the long-lived hyperfine sublevels of
the ground electronic state. To realize the gate, we apply a global laser pulse
to transfer the atoms to a Rydberg state with strong blockade interaction that
suppresses simultaneous excitation of neighboring atoms arranged in a
star-graph configuration. The number of Rydberg excitations, and thereby the
parity of the resulting state, depends on the multiqubit input state. Upon
changing the sign of the interaction and de-exciting the atoms with an
identical laser pulse, the system acquires a geometric phase that depends only
on the parity of the excited state, while the dynamical phase is completely
canceled. Using single qubit rotations, this transformation can be converted to
the C$_k$Z or C$_k$NOT quantum gate for $k+1$ atoms. We also present extensions
of the scheme to implement quantum gates between distant atomic qubits
connected by a quantum bus consisting of a chain of atoms.

Conclusion: 量子相干性与最大可提取功的关系依赖于基的选择，为量子电池设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We identify a connection between quantum coherence and the maximum
extractable work from a quantum battery, and to this end, we define the
coherence-constrained maximal work (CCMW) as the highest amount of work
extractable via coherence-preserving unitaries, optimized over all quantum
states with fixed coherence in a given dimension. For qubit systems, we derive
an analytical relation between the CCMW and the input coherence, defined with
respect to an arbitrary fixed basis. Strikingly, we find that for fixed quantum
coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the maximal extractable work decreases with
increase of coherence. In contrast, when quantum coherence is with respect to a
basis for which the Hamiltonian possesses off-diagonal elements, and has equal
diagonal elements, the CCMW increases with the level of quantum coherence. We
numerically observe that the basis-dependent response of the CCMW also persists
in higher-dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we show that even in higher
dimensions one can derive closed-form relations between the CCMW and the input
quantum coherence within certain numerically-assessed conclusions. We also
comment on the structure of passive states in an isocoherent scenario, that is,
states from which no energy can be extracted under coherence-preserving
unitaries.

Conclusion: 热操作和催化通道在量子热力学和信息理论中具有重要地位，为理解系统与环境平衡提供了新视角。

Abstract: Thermal operations are quantum channels that have taken a prominent role in
deriving fundamental thermodynamic limitations in quantum systems. We show that
these channels are uniquely characterized by a purely quantum information
theoretic property: They admit a dilation into a unitary process that leaves
the environment invariant when applied to the equilibrium state. In other
words, they are the only channels that preserve equilibrium between system and
environment. Extending this perspective, we explore an information theoretic
idealization of heat bath behavior, by considering channels where the
environment remains locally invariant for every initial state of the system.
These are known as catalytic channels. We show that catalytic channels provide
a refined hierarchy of Gibbs-preserving maps for fully-degenerate Hamiltonians,
and are closely related to dual unitary quantum circuits.

Conclusion: 该RL驱动的方法能够高效探索复杂量子态空间并合成接近最优的量子电路，为量子电路优化提供了资源高效的基础。

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

Abstract: Multi-qubit quantum states corresponding to bipartite graphs $G(U,V,E)$ are
examined. These states are constructed by applying $CNOT$ gates to an arbitrary
separable multi-qubit quantum state. The entanglement distance of the resulting
states is derived analytically for an arbitrary bipartite graph structure. A
relationship between entanglement and the vertex degree is established.
Additionally, we identify how quantum correlators relate to the number of
vertices with odd and even degrees in the sets $U$ and $V$. Based on these
results, quantum protocols are proposed for quantifying the number of vertices
with odd and even degrees in the sets $U$ and $V$. For a specific case where
the bipartite graph is a star graph, we analytically calculate the dependence
of entanglement distance on the state parameters. These results are also
verified through quantum simulations on the AerSimulator, including noise
models. Furthermore, we use quantum calculations to quantify the number of
vertices with odd degrees in $U$ and $V$. The results agree with the
theoretical predictions.

Abstract: A synthetic artificial neuron network functional in a regime where quantum
information processes are co-integrated with spiking computation provides
significant improvement in the capabilities of neuromorphic systems in
performing artificial intelligence and autonomy tasks. This provides the
ability to execute with the qubit coherence states and entanglement as well as
in tandem to perform functions such as read out and basic arithmetic with
conventional spike-encoding. Ultimately, this enables the generation and
computational processing of information packets with advanced capabilities and
an increased level of security in their routing. We now use the dynamical pulse
sequences generated by a memristive spiking neuron to drive synthetic neurons
with built-in superconductor-ionic memories built in a lateral layout with
integrated Niobium metal electrodes as well as a gate terminal and an atomic
layer deposited ionic barrier. The memories operate at very low voltage and
with direct, and hysteretic Josephson tunneling and provide enhanced coherent
properties enabling qubit behavior. We operated now specifically in burst mode
to drive its built-in reconfigurable qubit states and direct the resulting
quantum trajectory. We analyze the new system with a Hamiltonian that considers
an integrated rotational dependence, dependent on the unique co-integrated
bursting mode spiking- and where the total above threshold spike count is
adjustable with variation of the level of coupling between the neurons. We then
examined the impact of key parameters with a longer-term non-Markovian quantum
memory and finally explored a process and algorithm for the generation of
information packets with a coupled and entangled set of these artificial neuron
qubits that provides for a quantum process to define the level of regularity or
awareness of the information packets.

Conclusion: 量子问题的计算复杂性显著高于经典问题，且非交换图的独立性数判定也是NP难的。

Abstract: We show that approximating the trace norm contraction coefficient of a
quantum channel within a constant factor is NP-hard. Equivalently, this shows
that determining the optimal success probability for encoding a bit in a
quantum system undergoing noise is NP-hard. This contrasts with the classical
analogue of this problem that can clearly by solved efficiently. Our hardness
results also hold for deciding if the contraction coefficient is equal to 1. As
a consequence, we show that deciding if a non-commutative graph has an
independence number of at least 2 is NP-hard. In addition, we establish a
converging hierarchy of semidefinite programming upper bounds on the
contraction coefficient.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) crystals offer a route to scale up trapped ion systems
for quantum sensing and quantum simulation applications. However, engineering
coherent spin-motion couplings and effective spin-spin interactions in large
crystals poses technical challenges associated with decoherence and prolonged
timescales to generate appreciable entanglement. Here, we explore the
possibility to speed up these interactions in 3D crystals via parametric
amplification. We derive a general Hamiltonian for the parametric amplification
of spin-motion coupling that is applicable to crystals of any dimension in both
rf Paul traps and Penning traps. Unlike in lower dimensional crystals, we find
that the ability to faithfully (uniformly) amplify the spin-spin interactions
in 3D crystals depends on the physical implementation of the spin-motion
coupling. We consider the light-shift (LS) gate, and the so-called
phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gates, and
find that only the latter gate can be faithfully amplified in general 3D
crystals. We discuss a situation where non-uniform amplification can be
advantageous. We also reconsider the impact of counter-rotating terms on
parametric amplification and find that they are not as detrimental as previous
studies suggest.

Abstract: Gaussian quantum probes have been widely used in quantum metrology and
thermometry, where the goal is to estimate the temperature of an environment
with which the probe interacts. It was recently shown that introducing initial
position-momentum (PM) correlations in such probes can enhance the estimation
precision compared to standard, uncorrelated Gaussian states. Motivated by
these findings, we investigate whether PM correlations can also be advantageous
in a simultaneous estimation setting, specifically, when estimating both the PM
correlations themselves and the effective environment temperature that
interacts with the probe. Using the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, we
derive new precision bounds for this joint estimation task. Additionally, we
demonstrate that such correlations can serve as a resource to improve
temperature estimation within this multiparameter context. Finally, we analyze
the compatibility between the two parameters, establishing conditions under
which the derived bounds can be saturated.

Abstract: Large-scale quantum computers possess the capacity to effectively tackle
practical problems that can be insurmountable for classical computers. The main
challenge in building these quantum computers is to realize scalable modules
for remote qubits and entanglement. By assembling small, specialized parts into
a larger architecture, the modular approach mitigates complexity and
uncertainty. Such a distributed architecture requires non-local quantum gate
operations between remote qubits. An essential method for implementing such
operations, known as quantum gate teleportation, requires only local
operations, classical communication, and shared entanglement. Till today, the
quantum gate teleportation using a photonic chip has remained elusive. Here we
experimentally demonstrate the quantum teleportation of an on-chip
controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, assisted with the scalable silicon chip platform,
high-fidelity local quantum logic gates, linear optical components,
post-selected entanglement, and coincidence measurements from photonic qubits.
First, we measure and characterize our teleported chip-scale CNOT gate with an
average truth table fidelity of 93.1 +- 0.3%. Second, for different input
polarization states, we obtain an average quantum state fidelity of 87.0 +-
2.2% with our teleported on-chip CNOT gate. Third, we use our non-local CNOT
gate for remote entanglement creation of four Bell states, with an average
quantum state fidelity of 86.2 +- 0.8%. Fourthly, we fully characterize our
teleported on-chip CNOT gate with a quantum process fidelity 83.1 +- 2.0%, and
an average non-local CNOT gate fidelity of 86.5 +- 2.2%. Our teleported
photonic on-chip quantum logic gate could be extended both to multiple qubits
and chip-scale modules towards fault-tolerant and large-scale distributed
quantum computation.

Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal
boron nitride ($\mathrm{hBN}$) has attracted attention for its potential
applications in quantum sensing. While GHz-scale sensing at low magnetic fields
has been demonstrated with these defects, their behavior at high fields remains
largely unexplored. We investigate the spin relaxation dynamics of
$\mathrm{V_B^-}$ centers over temperatures of $15-250$ K and magnetic fields of
up to $7$ T, corresponding to a ground-state splitting of $\sim 200$ GHz. Our
results uncover distinct relaxation regimes, transitioning from
spin-spin-interaction-driven and disorder-induced stretched exponential
dynamics at low temperatures and fields to relaxation dominated by
single-phonon processes at elevated magnetic fields. We extract temperature-
and magnetic-field-dependent scaling behaviors of the relaxation rate to
provide a quantitative picture of the interactions between $\mathrm{V_B^-}$
centers and their environment. Our results pave the way towards high-field,
sub-terahertz quantum sensors based on two-dimensional spin-defect platforms.

Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes are essential to the implementation of
fault-tolerant quantum computation. Homological products of classical codes
offer a versatile framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes
with desirable properties, especially quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC)
codes. Based on extensions of the Bravyi--K\"{o}nig theorem that encompass
codes without geometric locality, we establish a series of general no-go
theorems for fault-tolerant logical gates supported by hypergraph product
codes. Specifically, we show that non-Clifford logical gates cannot be
implemented transversally on hypergraph product codes of all product
dimensions, and that the dimensions impose various limitations on the
accessible level of the Clifford hierarchy gates by constant-depth local
circuits. We also discuss examples both with and without geometric locality
which attain the Clifford hierarchy bounds. Our results reveal fundamental
restrictions on logical gates originating from highly general algebraic
structures, extending beyond existing knowledge only in geometrically local,
finite logical qubits, transversal, or 2-dimensional product cases, and may
guide the vital study of fault-tolerant quantum computation with qLDPC codes.

Abstract: In this article, we explore the temperature dependence of the electrical
glassy dynamics in insulating amorphous indium oxide (a-InOx) and granular Al
films. We use non-isothermal gate voltage protocols, which can reveal changes
in the dynamics induced by the temperature, when logarithmic relaxations devoid
of characteristic times are at work. We demonstrate that, contrary to almost 20
years of opposite belief, the dynamics of amorphous indium oxide films in the
liquid helium temperature range is thermally activated, i.e. it slows down
under cooling and accelerates upon heating. Amorphous indium oxide thus adds to
the list of glassy disordered systems in which we already demonstrated thermal
activation, which includes granular Al and amorphous NbxSi1-x films. Moreover,
measurements up to 40 K in a-InOx and granular Al films reveal the close
similarity between the two systems and a very anomalous character of the
thermal activation, with an effective activation energy increasing with T as
T^2 . We so far have no explanation for it. Its further study and understanding
may be important for the physics of electron glasses.

Method: 通过分析不同类型的无序系统，研究局部磁化算符矩阵元素的分布形式，并探讨其与无序分布的关系。

Result: 发现局部可观测量的期望值分布形式与无序分布一致，这种分布可能导致对非遍历性和ETH崩溃的错误判断。

Conclusion: 提出调整能量窗口的方法以正确评估ETH的适用性，并建立了本征态期望值分布与淬火实验结果的联系。

Abstract: Ergodic isolated quantum many-body systems satisfy the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., the expectation values of local
observables in the system's eigenstates approach the predictions of the
microcanonical ensemble. However, the ETH does not specify what happens to
expectation values of local observables within an energy window when the
average over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation
values of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval
and may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104},
214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved
magnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may
\textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering
various types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the
distributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator
mirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution
is a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with
moments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window
when analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum
many-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and
provide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates
and the outcomes of quench experiments.

Abstract: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) is a powerful theoretical framework for
analyzing systems with many interacting degrees of freedom. This tutorial
provides an accessible introduction to DMFT. We begin with a linear model where
the DMFT equations can be derived exactly, allowing readers to develop clear
intuition for the underlying principles. We then introduce the cavity method, a
versatile approach for deriving DMFT equations for non-linear systems. The
tutorial concludes with an application to the generalized Lotka--Volterra model
of interacting species, demonstrating how DMFT reduces the complex dynamics of
many-species communities to a tractable single-species stochastic process. Key
insights include understanding how quenched disorder enables the reduction from
many-body to effective single-particle dynamics, recognizing the role of
self-averaging in simplifying complex systems, and seeing how collective
interactions give rise to non-Markovian feedback effects.

Abstract: We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi
polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for
static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body
Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a
recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the
resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity
mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We
identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of
Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the
impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give
rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the
limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition
is absent.

Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous
attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature
superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of
their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In
this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding
based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we
investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$
ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we
find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero}
temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization
length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice,
whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This
greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert
space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant
delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive
for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough
exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite
temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative
differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows
self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian
behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient
follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially
decreases for decreasing temperatures.

ground states. These include states resembling ionic compounds with
face-centered cubic or simple cubic lattice structure. Upon increasing the
scattering length, the dimensionality of the symmetry-breaking is lower due to
the suppression of large densities, leading to segregated planar or tubular
density profiles. We also show that these states are not only stable ground
states, but can also emerge dynamically upon time evolution.

Abstract: Dual lattices such as honeycomb and hexagonal lattices typically obey
Babinet's principle in optics, which states that the expected interference
patterns of two complementary diffracting objects are identical and
indistinguishable, except for their overall intensity. Here, we study
Kapitza--Dirac diffraction of Bose--Einstein condensates in optical lattices
and find that matter waves in dual lattices obey Babinet's principle only under
the condition of weak-pulse Raman--Nath regimes. In contrast, the
Kapitza--Dirac matter-wave diffraction in the strong-pulse Raman--Nath regime
(corresponding to the phase wrapping method we developed to generate
sub-wavelength phase structures in Sci. Rep. 10, 5870 (2020)) can break
Babinet's principle and clearly resolve the distinct interference patterns of
the dual honeycomb and hexagonal lattices. This method offers exceptional
precision in characterizing lattice configurations and advance the study of
symmetry-related phenomena, overcoming the limitations of real-space imaging.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established
Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body
physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each
atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively
frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of
novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$
symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the
consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give
rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that
this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit,
as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the
violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is
suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily
testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.

measurements, we assess the experimental feasibility, and discuss potential
extensions to more advanced quantum control as well as searches of the nuclear

Abstract: Free fermions in disguise (FFD) Hamiltonians describe spin chains which can
be mapped to free fermions, but not via a Jordan-Wigner transformation.
Although the mapping gives access to the full Hamiltonian spectrum, the
computation of spin correlation functions is generally hard. Indeed, the
dictionary between states in the spin and free-fermion Hilbert spaces is highly
non-trivial, due to the non-linear and non-local nature of the mapping, as well
as the exponential degeneracy of the Hamiltonian eigenspaces. In this work, we
provide a series of results characterizing the Hilbert space associated to FFD
Hamiltonians. We focus on the original model introduced by Paul Fendley and
show that the corresponding Hilbert space admits the exact factorization
$\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_F\otimes \mathcal{H}_D$, where $\mathcal{H}_F$ hosts
the fermionic operators, while $\mathcal{H}_D$ accounts for the exponential
degeneracy of the energy eigenspaces. By constructing a family of spin
operators generating the operator algebra supported on $\mathcal{H}_D$, we
further show that $\mathcal{H}_D=\mathcal{H}_{F'}\otimes
\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$, where $\mathcal{H}_{F'}$ hosts ancillary free
fermions in disguise, while $\mathcal{H}_{\widetilde{D}}$ is generated by the
common eigenstates of an extensive set of commuting Pauli strings. Our
construction allows us to fully resolve the exponential degeneracy of all
Hamiltonian eigenspaces and is expected to have implications for the
computation of spin correlation functions, both in and out of equilibrium.

Result: 在所有维度下均观察到与Zurek猜想一致的标度律，且不同算法的指数一致。

Conclusion: Zurek标度律的普适性超出预期，暗示其物理意义。

Abstract: The Kibble mechanism plays a prominent role in the theory of the early
Universe, as an explanation of the possible formation of cosmic strings. Zurek
suggested the analogous effect in liquid helium under rapid cooling, and he
conjectured - together with del Campo and Kibble - a scaling-law for the
relation between the density of remnant topological defects and the cooling
rate, when a system passes through its critical temperature. Such scaling-laws
were indeed observed in condensed matter experiments.
  Here we test the validity of Zurek's scaling-law in a different framework. We
numerically study the behavior of the Ising model (with classical spins) in 1,
2 and 3 dimensions under rapid cooling. This model does not have topological
defects, so we consider the dynamics of domains instead, i.e. we measure their
evolution during a cooling process down to zero temperature. For several Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithms, we consistently observe scaling-laws along the
lines of Zurek's conjecture, in all dimensions under consideration, which shows
that this feature holds more generally than expected. It is highly remarkable
that even the exponents of these scaling-laws are consistent for three
different algorithms, which hints at a physical meaning.

Abstract: We report the existence of a large set of ferromagnetic scarred states in the
one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model with long-range interactions, in a
regime with no ferromagnetic phase at finite temperature. These scarred states
are distributed over different spectral regions, surrounded by paramagnetic
states. We show that simple initial conditions, consisting in a few small
magnetic domains, selectively populate these scarred states. This leads to the
appearance of a special dynamical phase, which we call scarred ferromagnetic
phase. As a consequence, initial states with a small number of small magnetic
domains evolve towards ferromagnetic equilibrium states, whereas initial states
with larger domains or no magnetic structure relax to the expected thermal
paramagnetic equilibrium state.

Abstract: Understanding transport in interacting quantum many-body systems is a central
challenge in condensed matter and statistical physics. Numerical studies
typically rely on two main approaches: Dynamics of linear-response functions in
closed systems and Markovian dynamics governed by master equations for
boundary-driven open systems. While the equivalence of their dynamical behavior
has been explored in recent studies, a systematic comparison of the transport
coefficients obtained from these two classes of methods remains an open
question. Here, we address this gap by comparing and contrasting the dc
diffusion constant $\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ computed from the aforementioned
two approaches. We find a clear mismatch between the two, with
$\mathcal{D}_{\text{dc}}$ exhibiting a strong dependence on the system-bath
coupling for the boundary-driven technique, highlighting fundamental
limitations of such a method in calculating the transport coefficients related
to asymptotic dynamical behavior of the system. We trace the origin of this
mismatch to the incorrect order of limits of time $t \rightarrow \infty$ and
system size $L\rightarrow \infty$, which we argue to be intrinsic to
boundary-driven setups. As a practical resolution, we advocate computing only
time-dependent transport coefficients within the boundary-driven framework,
which show excellent agreement with those obtained from the Kubo formalism
based on closed-system dynamics, up to a timescale set by the system size. This
leads us to interpret the sensitivity of the dc diffusion constant on the
system-bath coupling strength in an open system as a potential diagnostic for
finite-size effects.

Abstract: We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions
between phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis
focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of
Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently
large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor
symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between two
gapped phases: one in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely
broken and another where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to
$\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We provide an explicit lattice model that
exhibits this transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which
includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a
non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for
$N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear
between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the
non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined
quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.

Abstract: Identifying model Hamiltonians is a vital step toward creating predictive
models of materials. Here, we combine Bayesian optimization with the EDRIXS
numerical package to infer Hamiltonian parameters from resonant inelastic X-ray
scattering (RIXS) spectra within the single atom approximation. To evaluate the
efficacy of our method, we test it on experimental RIXS spectra of NiPS3,

Result: 发现重入行为，即有序态随温度升高而出现，且该行为在α>1.4时出现并随α增大范围扩大。

Conclusion: 重入行为可能是二维Stoner相变的基本特征，与电子结构细节无关。

Abstract: We present the results of a mean-field analysis of the temperature evolution
of a ferromagnetic Stoner transition in a two-dimensional (2D) system with an
isotropic dispersion $\varepsilon_k \propto k^{2\alpha}$, which for $\alpha >1$
models flat dispersions in various multi-layer graphene systems in a
displacement field. This study is an extension to a finite $T$ of previous
studies at $T=0$, which found both first-order and second-order Stoner
transitions, depending on the value of $\alpha$ and special behavior at $\alpha
=1$ and $\alpha =2$. We find that the Stoner transition at a finite $T$
displays new features not seen at $T=0$. The most interesting one is the
reentrant behavior, where the ordered state emerges as temperature is
increased. This behavior develops at $\alpha >1.4$ and the range where it holds
increases with $\alpha$. We conjecture that the reentrant behavior is the
fundamental feature of the Stoner transition in 2D, not sensitive to the
details of the electronic structure.

Motivation: 研究高压下3D Kagome金属BaFe2Al9的异常CDW行为，探索其电子-电子和电子-声子耦合机制。

Method: 通过粉末和单晶X射线衍射（XRD）分析晶格结构，观察高压下的异常膨胀和衍射强度变化。

Conclusion: BaFe2Al9是一种具有非常规CDW行为和强电子-声子耦合的3D Kagome平台，为探索电子关联诱导的奇异电子态提供了新途径。

Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW) is a macroscopic quantum state characterized by
long-range lattice distortion and modulated charge density. Conventionally,
CDWs compete with other electronic orders (e.g. superconductivity) and are
suppressed under hydrostatic pressure. Intriguingly, the Kagome-variant metal
BaFe2Al9, crystallized in a three-dimensional structure, exhibits
pressure-enhanced CDW ordering, where the transition temperature (TCDW) rises
from ~110 K to room temperature near 3.6 GPa. The lattice structure was checked
by both powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD data reveals
an abnormal lattice expansion along a axis near 4-5 GPa upon compression. The
strongly suppressed diffraction intensity and splitting diffraction spots from
single crystal indicates cracking and breakdown to smaller pieces, indicative
of an intrinsic first-order transition character. This anomalous response
implies a CDW mechanism dominated by electron-electron and/or electron-phonon
correlations, distinct from Fermi-surface nesting in conventional systems.
Concomitant dome-shaped pressure-dependent resistance suggests competing
electronic phases. Our work establishes BaFe2Al9 as a 3D Kagome platform with
unconventional CDW behavior and strong electron-phonon coupling, which provides
an alternative platform to explore the electron correlation induced exotic
electronic states and other potential emergent quantum phenomenon.

Abstract: Topological insulators are a new class of insulators with conducting surface
state. Most of the topological insulators are chalcogenides, where a tiny
amount of chalcogen vacancy destroys the predicted bulk insulating state and
results in a metallic or semimetallic bulk electrical transport. BaBiO$_3$
(BBO) is an interesting large bandgap (0.7 eV) insulator that upon hole doping
becomes a superconductor and is theoretically predicted to show a topological
insulating state under electron doping. We have explored electron doping
through the chemical substitution of fluorine atoms at the oxygen site. The
single crystals of BBO and fluorine doped BBO were synthesized via a one-step
solid-state technique. The single crystals of pure BBO and 10 % F -doped BBO
(BaBiO$_{2.7}$F$_{0.3}$) are chemically single-phase samples and crystallize in
monoclinic I2/m crystal structure. The core level and valence band X-ray
photoelectron spectra confirm electron doping in the 10% fluorine-doped BBO. 20
% F-doped BBO appears to be a multiphase sample, confirmed by back-scattered
electron (BSE) imaging and X-ray diffraction. This article reports on the
successful growth of pure and F-doped BBO using a one-step solid-state
technique and discusses the effect of F-doping on structural and electronic
properties.

Abstract: Tunable monochromatic magneto-transmission is one of the most established
magneto-optical techniques, particularly well suited for pulsed magnetic
fields. It employs fixed-wavelength monochromatic light as the probe, while the
magnetic field is swept to bring the sample into resonance with the photon
energy. The key component of this setup is a tunable laser system, typically
consisting of a Ti:sapphire laser coupled with an optical parametric
oscillator. However, such laser systems are often bulky, expensive, and
inherently unstable, which significantly limits their widespread application in
magneto-optical laboratories. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy,
cost-effective, and compact tunable monochromatic magneto-transmission system
based on a combination of a laser-driven white light source and a mini
monochromator, and demonstrate its feasibility and performance in a
millisecond-range pulsed magnetic field condition. To verify the accuracy of
this new and simplified setup, we performed Faraday rotation measurements on
the geometrically frustrated spin system CdCr2O4, as well as
magneto-transmission experiments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice
antiferromagnet SrCu2(BO3)2. These results show excellent agreement with
previous reports, confirming the reliability and precision of the new setup.

Abstract: Excitons are bosonic quasiparticles with a variety of applications in
optoelectronics, photosyn thesis, and dissipationless informatics, and their
lifetime can become sufficiently long to form a quantum condensate. While
exciton condensation has been predicted to occur as a ground state of a solid,
so called an excitonic insulator, whose material realization has been elusive.
Here we report the observation of direct photoemission signals from excitons in
a ground state of a very recent excitonic insulator candidate Ta2Pd3Te5 below
its metal-insulator transition temperature using orbital-selective
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the excitons
have a lower energy than the valence band maximum to possibly drive the phase
transition. This measurement further discloses the size and the unusual odd
parity of the exciton wave function. The present finding opens an avenue toward
applications of coherent excitons in solid systems and searching for exotic
quantum phases of exciton condensates.

Result: 发现了奇特的解禁闭相、VBS相和一个多临界点，其中电和磁激发通过增强的$\mathbb{Z}_2$对偶性关联。

Conclusion: 多临界点表现出连续相变特征，涉及$e$和$m$任意子激发间隙的软化，并可能暗示超出共格极限的晶体序。

Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase diagram of an ``odd'' variant of the
two-dimensional Ising Fradkin--Shenker model, characterized by a uniform
background of static $e$ and $m$ charges. Using large-scale tensor network and
exact diagonalization methods, we determine the topology of the phase diagram,
identifying an ``odd'' deconfined phase, confinement- and Higgs-induced valence
bond solids (VBS), and a trivial paramagnet. Most notably, we uncover an exotic
multicritical point along the self-dual line, where electric and magnetic
excitations are related by an enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2$ duality. This transition
is marked by the simultaneous onset of confinement, Higgs condensation,
translational symmetry breaking, and spontaneous duality symmetry breaking.
Within our numerical accuracy, the transition appears continuous, involving the
softening of excitation gaps for $e$ and $m$ anyons at finite momentum. At
intermediate couplings, we further identify VBS phases with enlarged unit
cells, potentially indicating frustration-induced crystalline order beyond
commensurate limits.

Result: 热霍尔电导率κxy/T显著超出半整数量化值，且Γ和Γ′相互作用对其有显著影响。

Conclusion: 增强的热霍尔响应主要由拓扑马约拉纳费米子贡献，为理解强关联材料提供了新途径。

Abstract: We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with
additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature
tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We
find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature,
$\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer
quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature.
Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\kappa_{xy}/T$ is
consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana
fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the
additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\Gamma$ and
$\Gamma^{\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we
show that positive $\Gamma$ and negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$ lead to a remarkable
enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with
the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\Gamma$ term go
beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation
effects, while those of the $\Gamma^\prime$ term are well captured at the
classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced
thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from
topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the
critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical
framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such
as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap
between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated
materials.

Motivation: 理解TmVO$_4$在不同参数（如磁场、应变场、化学组成和核自旋耦合）下的铁四极有序相变及其调控机制。

Method: 采用伪自旋1/2模型，结合铁四极Jahn-Teller相互作用、$B_{1g}$剪切应变、横向磁场和核超精细耦合A，分析相变行为。

Result: 在零磁场和应变下，电子四极子在$T_Q$处经历二阶相变；在更低温度$T_N$下，核自旋Ising相互作用导致熵完全塌缩。横向磁场下核矩平滑极化，而应变驱动下观察到双步弹性热效应。

Conclusion: TmVO$_4$是一种可调控的应变驱动固态制冷材料，其相变行为可通过多种参数灵活控制。

Abstract: Rare-earth material TmVO$_4$ shows ferro-quadrupolar order below a critical
temperature which can be tuned by various parameters such as a magnetic field,
a strain field, chemical composition, and nuclear spin coupling to its
non-Kramers electronic doublets. In this work, we study a pseudo-spin-1/2 model
to understand the various phases in TmVO$_4$. The model captures coupled
electronic and nuclear orders via (i) a ferro-quadrupolar Jahn-Teller
interaction, (ii) a $B_{1g}$ shear strain, (iii) a transverse magnetic field,
and (iv) a weak on-site nuclear hyperfine coupling A. At zero transverse
magnetic and strain fields, electronic quadrupoles undergo a second-order
transition at $T_Q$, lowering the entropy per site from ln 4 to ln 2. At a much
lower $T_N$ ~ $A^2/T_Q$, virtual electronic fluctuations mediate an effective
nuclear-spin Ising interaction, driving a second transition that collapses the
remaining entropy. Under a transverse magnetic field, nuclear moments polarize
smoothly, replacing the sharp low-T transition by a crossover. In contrast,
adiabatic $B_{1g}$ strain sweeps across the two ordering temperatures yielding
a pronounced two-step elastocaloric effect, highlighting TmVO$_4$ as a tunable
strain-driven solid-state refrigerant.

Abstract: Conductivity is one of the most direct probes of electronic systems, yet its
theoretical description remains challenging in the presence of strong non-local
correlations. In this Letter, we analyze the conductivity of the half-filled
single-band Hubbard model and identify the role of spatial correlations across
the Mott transition. We show that in the correlated metallic regime, an
accurate description of the conductivity requires not only the correct spectral
function but also the inclusion of complex multi-electron processes encoded in
vertex corrections. The crossover to the Mott insulating regime is marked by a
vanishing contribution of vertex corrections to the DC conductivity. However,
in the Mott insulating case, vertex corrections remain significant for the
optical conductivity.

Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a bilayer of antiparallel dipolar excitons with
a 1:2 density ratio between the layers, as a function of temperature and
density. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that such a system
supports the formation of trimers, namely, three-exciton bound states
consisting of a single dipole in one layer and two dipoles in the second layer.
At sufficiently low temperatures and densities, these trimers condense into a
trimer superfluid phase. Increasing the excitonic density induces a quantum
phase transition into a phase in which condensates of independent dipoles exist
in both layers, in parallel to the trimers. We also study the thermal
transitions out of these phases, and find that while the normal state is
reached directly from the trimer superfluid, the thermal disordering of the
two-superfluid phase involves an intermediate state which is either a trimer
superfluid or a single excitonic condensate in the denser layer. A potential
experimental realization using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures
is discussed.

Abstract: We report the formation of Bi(111) bilayer (BL) islands and crater structures
on Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111) surfaces induced by voltage pulses from an STM tip. Pulses
above a threshold voltage ($+3$ V) produce craters $\sim 0.5$ microns in
diameter, similar to the size of the tip. Redeposited material self-assembles
into a network of atomically ordered islands with a lattice constant identical
to the underlying Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface. The island size monotonically decreases
over several microns from the pulse site, until the pristine Bi$_2$Te$_3$
surface is recovered. We assign these islands to Bi BL based on atomic
resolution images, analysis of step heights, and tunneling spectroscopy. The
dependence of bilayer formation on bias polarity and the evidence for defect
diffusion together suggest a mechanism driven by the interplay of field
evaporation and tunneling-current-induced Joule heating.

Abstract: Long-life interlayer excitons (IXs) in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
heterostructure are promising for realizing excitonic condensates at high
temperatures. Critical to this objective is to separate the IX ground state
(the lowest energy of IX state) emission from other states emissions. Filtering
the IX ground state is also essential in uncovering the dynamics of correlated
excitonic states, such as the excitonic Mott insulator. Here, we show that the
IX ground state in WSe2/MoS2 heterobilayer can be separated from other states
by its spatial profile. The emissions from different moire IX modes are
identified by their different energies and spatial distributions, which fits
well with the rate-diffusion model for cascading emission. Our results show
spatial filtering of the ground state mode and enrich the toolbox to realize
correlated states at elevated temperatures.

Abstract: The concept of pseudo-spin provides a general framework for describing
physical systems featuring two-component spinors, including light polarization,
sublattice degrees of freedom in bipartite lattices, and valley polarization in
2D materials. In all cases, the pseudo-spin can be mapped to a Stokes vector on
the Poincar\'e sphere. Stokes polarimeters for measuring the polarization of
light are a powerful tool with a wide range of applications both in classical
and quantum science. Generalizing Stokes polarimetry to other spinor degrees of
freedom is thus a challenge of prime importance. Here, we introduce and
demonstrate a Stokes polarimeter for the sublattice polarization in a bipartite
photonic lattice. Our method relies on k-space photoluminescence intensity
measurements under controlled phase shifts and attenuations applied
independently to each sublattice. We implement our method using honeycomb
arrays of coupled microcavities realizing photonic analogs of graphene and
hexagonal boron nitride. Using our sublattice polarimeter, we reconstruct the
Bloch modes in amplitude and phase across the Brillouin zone, achieving
sub-linewidth precision in the determination of their eigenenergies, including
near band touching points. This enables full access to the system Bloch
Hamiltonian and quantum geometric tensor. Our approach can readily be extended
to more complex systems with additional internal degrees of freedom, enabling
experimental investigations of trigonal warping, Chern insulating phases, and
Euler-class topology in multigap systems.

levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's
operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles,
i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum
Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the
thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat
engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other
graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer
graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal
that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while
achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though
the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and
QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we
identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict
adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.

TL;DR: 论文指出，激子光谱中三子峰与激子峰的分裂通常被解释为三子结合能，但理论表明这种观点不完整。暗激子比亮激子结合更强，导致三子波函数不对称，分裂的主要贡献是亮暗激子结合能差异。模型定量解释了MoSe2和WSe2的三子能量。

Abstract: Exciton spectroscopy serves as a sensitive probe of electronic states in
two-dimensional semiconductors. A prominent feature in optical spectra is the
trion peak arising from the binding of a charge carrier to an exciton. The
splitting between the exciton and trion peaks is usually interpreted as the
trion binding energy, but we theoretically show that this view is incomplete.
Since dark excitons are more strongly bound than the bright exciton, the trion
wave function is asymmetric and a large contribution to the measured splitting
is the difference between the bright and dark exciton binding energies. Our
model quantitatively explains the measured trion energies in MoSe2 and WSe2,
demonstrating the importance of the internal structure of the exciton for the
interpretation of the optical response of transition metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: Time modulation introduces a dynamic degree of freedom for tailoring thermal
radiation beyond the limits of static materials. Here we investigate far-field
thermal radiation from a periodically time-modulated SiC film under the Floquet
nonequilibrium Green's function framework. We show that time modulation enables
radiative energy transfer into the far field that surpasses the limit imposed
by the equilibrium thermal fluctuations. This enhancement originates from the
modulation-induced coupling between evanescent surface phonon polaritons and
propagating modes, effectively bridging the energy and momentum mismatch
through frequency conversion. Notably, even at zero temperature, the film emits
a finite radiative heat flux due to nonequilibrium photon occupation generated
by the modulation. The radiative output grows with increasing modulation
strength, highlighting the role of external work in driving far-field emission.
These results establish time modulation as an effective mechanism for bridging
near-field and far-field regimes, opening new pathways for active thermal
radiation control.

Abstract: Focused electron-beam induced deposition (FEBID) has emerged as a powerful
technique for shifting from direct-write fabrication of two- to
three-dimensional nanostructures, which reflects a broader movement across
nanotechnology as a whole. Fields such as nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, and
energy storage and harvesting are poised to benefit from a new generation of
greener, more versatile, and multifunctional technologies enabled by this
transition to 3D structures. The availability of numerous precursors enables
the deposition of a wide range of materials, including metallic, organic,
semiconducting, magnetic, and superconductors. While materials fabricated using
FEBID typically contain significant amounts of impurities, several strategies
have been developed to achieve high purity. These include the synthesis of new
precursors, optimizing growth conditions, introducing reactive gases during the
growth process, and post-deposition purification techniques.Although iron
(Fe)-based deposits are gaining particular interest due to their potential
applications in nanomagnetism and spintronics, FEBID of Fe has not developed
significantly due to several challenges, mainly controlling the e-beam reaction
with Fe precursors which often results in low yield growth due to a slow
dissociation reaction. This work advances the controlled FEBID of complex 3D Fe
nanostructures by further refining the spatial dwell-time resolution map to
print complex structures within nm feature accuracy, through quantitatively
calibrating Monte Carlo simulations with the measured experimental growth
profiles. The methodology, visualized in 3D graphs, enables high shape fidelity
in Fe growth and maintains the ongoing growth across multiple complex
structures through predictive tuning of model parameters based on input
geometry, an outcome that was previously unachievable for Fe.
