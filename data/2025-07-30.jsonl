Our spin-polarised band structure shows that the node of band\ncrossing between spin-up and spin-down bands around the Fermi energy exactly\nlies at the Gamma and A-symmetry points. The Fermi crossing is mostly exhibited\nby band-24, band-25 and band-26. The non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS)\nalong M'-Gamma-M and A-Z-A' symmetry is attributed to the broken time-reversal\n(PT ) symmetry. There are significant changes in the band profile under applied\npressure, as one can see the shifting of the node of band-24 and band-26\ntowards the lower energy side. The NRSS exhibited by band-24 along M'-Gamma-M\nsymmetry is notably small. Although the strength of NRSS of band-26 along\nA-Z-A' symmetry is significant but reduces under applied pressure. The\nanomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) values are prominent in -1 to 1 eV range. A\nsharp peaked and positive AHC values at ambient pressure, becomes spectrally\nbroadened and negative at 10 GPa due to pressure-induced band crossings and\nredistribution of Berry curvature near the Fermi level.

Journal submission planned (PRA)", "summary": "We study the variational optimization of entangled probe states for quantum\nsensing tasks involving the estimation of a structured linear function of local\nphase parameters. Specifically, we consider scenarios where each qubit in a\nspin-1/2 array accumulates a phase phi_i = alpha_i * theta, with a known weight\nvector alpha, reducing the task to single-parameter estimation of theta. Using\nparameterized quantum circuits composed of dipolar-interacting gates and global\nrotations, we optimize probe states with respect to the Classical Fisher\nInformation (CFI) using a gradient-free evolutionary strategy. We benchmark the\noptimized circuits for two relevant cases: (i) uniform encoding, where all\nqubits contribute equally to the phase function, and (ii) a custom encoding\nwhere a central qubit dominates the weight vector. In both cases, the optimized\nprobe states approach the respective entanglement-enhanced (EE) limits dictated\nby the encoding structure. Our results demonstrate the power of variational\napproaches for tailoring metrologically useful entanglement to specific\nestimation tasks in quantum sensor networks."}

Many approaches\nhave been proposed to mitigate or avoid the barren plateau phenomenon or, more\nbroadly, exponential concentration. However, due to the intricate interplay\nbetween quantum measurements and classical post-processing, we argue these\ntechniques often fail to circumvent concentration effects in practice. Here, by\nanalyzing concentration at the level of measurement outcome probabilities and\nleveraging tools from hypothesis testing, we develop a practical framework for\ndiagnosing whether a parameterized quantum model is inhibited by exponential\nconcentration. Applying this framework, we argue that several widely used\nmethods (including quantum natural gradient, sample-based optimization, and\ncertain neural-network-inspired initializations) do not overcome exponential\nconcentration with finite measurement budgets, though they may still aid\ntraining in other ways."}

In this paper, we make a\nsystematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in\nlattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice\nanomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological\ninvariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems\nallows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of\nthe technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the\nexpected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial\ndifferences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not,\ncontrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can\nbe non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they\nadmit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies\nat low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including\nIR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right,\nincluding connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body\nlocalized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make\nsubstantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop\nseveral theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric\nHamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems\ninto a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on\nsymmetries in QFT."}

Here, we propose a\nfractional topological phase without interaction in $(1+1)$-dimension, which is\ndriven by the Stark localization on top of topological flat bands, different\nfrom the conventional mechanism of the strongly correlated fractional\ntopological phases. A linear potential gradient applied to the flat bands\ndrives the Stark localization, under which the Stark localized states may\nhybridize and leads to a new gap in the real space, dubbed the real space\nenergy gap (RSEG). Unlike the integer topological band insulator obtained in\nthe weak linear potential regime without closing the original bulk gap, the\nfractional topological Stark insulating phase is resulted from the RSEG when\nthe linear potential gradient exceeds a critical value. We develop a\ntheoretical formalism to characterize the fractional topological Stark\ninsulator, and further show that the many-body state under topological pumping\nreturns to the initial state only after multiple $2\\pi$ periods of evolution,\ngiving the fractional charge pumping, similar to that in fractional quantum\nHall state.

A transformation to a basis that uses\nthe local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin\nstates for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the\nsymmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground\nstate phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of\ninter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration)\nand an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective\nHaldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground\nstate wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static\nproperties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and\nthe spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully\nselected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are\ncomplemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of\nthe dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the\nemergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong\ninteractions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for\ninteracting S=1 Heisenberg spins."}

We solve the resulting quantum\nimpurity problem, describing an Anderson impurity coupled to a local dephasing,\nusing weak-coupling perturbation theory in interaction and dephasing. We show\nthat the dissipative dynamics describes heating towards infinite temperature,\nwith a relaxation rate that depends strongly on interaction. The resulting\nsteady-state spectral functions are however non-trivial and show an interplay\nbetween coherent quasiparticle peak and local dephasing. We then discuss how\nthermalization towards infinite temperature emerges within DMFT, by solving the\nimpurity problem throughout its self-consistency. We show that thermalization\nunder open quantum system dynamics is qualitatively different from the closed\nsystem case.

Feedback is very welcome", "summary": "The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian\nand a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous\ntechniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic\nenergies (which appear, e.g., in Wilczek and Shapere's classical time crystal,\nor nonlinear capacitors) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre\ntransformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel\ntransformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that\nsuch anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of\nwell-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent\nHamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the\ncoupling strength to a dissipative environment.
