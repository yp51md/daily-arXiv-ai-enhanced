### [1] [Formal Verification of Variational Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10635)
*Nicola Assolini,Luca Marzari,Isabella Mastroeni,Alessandra di Pierro*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文首次深入研究了变分量子电路（VQC）的形式化验证问题，提出了基于抽象解释的新语义框架，并分析了其复杂性和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQC在量子机器学习中广泛应用，但其对抗性输入的脆弱性缺乏形式化验证方法，类似经典深度神经网络的验证技术尚未适用于量子场景。

Method: 受深度学习抽象解释方法启发，研究区间可达性技术在量子环境中的适用性，提出基于抽象解释的新语义框架。

Result: 量子特性（如状态归一化）引入变量间依赖关系，挑战现有方法；新框架能形式化定义VQC验证问题并分析其复杂性。

Conclusion: 论文为VQC的形式化验证提供了理论和实践基础，并在标准验证基准上验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are a central component of many quantum
machine learning algorithms, offering a hybrid quantum-classical framework
that, under certain aspects, can be considered similar to classical deep neural
networks. A shared aspect is, for instance, their vulnerability to adversarial
inputs, small perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While
formal verification techniques have been extensively developed for classical
models, no comparable framework exists for certifying the robustness of VQCs.
Here, we present the first in-depth theoretical and practical study of the
formal verification problem for VQCs. Inspired by abstract interpretation
methods used in deep learning, we analyze the applicability and limitations of
interval-based reachability techniques in the quantum setting. We show that
quantum-specific aspects, such as state normalization, introduce inter-variable
dependencies that challenge existing approaches. We investigate these issues by
introducing a novel semantic framework based on abstract interpretation, where
the verification problem for VQCs can be formally defined, and its complexity
analyzed. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on standard verification
benchmarks.

### [2] [Stabilizer Rényi Entropy Encodes Fusion Rules of Topological Defects and Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10656)
*Masahiro Hoshino,Yuto Ashida*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 稳定器Rényi熵（SRE）可作为一维量子临界系统中共形缺陷的通用信息探针，边界和拓扑缺陷分别表现为对SRE的对数修正和尺寸无关的普适项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子魔力的可计算度量SRE在共形缺陷中的通用性质，以揭示缺陷的对称性代数。

Method: 利用边界共形场论分析SRE的普适修正，并通过Ising模型的数值计算验证理论预测。

Result: 边界和拓扑缺陷分别导致SRE的对数修正和尺寸无关项，且多缺陷情况下的SRE反映了缺陷融合规则。

Conclusion: SRE能有效探测共形缺陷的普适性质，为研究非可逆对称代数提供了新工具。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE), a computable
measure of quantum magic, can serve as an information-theoretic probe for
universal properties associated with conformal defects in one-dimensional
quantum critical systems. Using boundary conformal field theory, we show that
open boundaries manifest as a universal logarithmic correction to the SRE,
whereas topological defects yield a universal size-independent term. When
multiple defects are present, we find that the universal terms in the SRE
faithfully reflect the defect-fusion rules that define noninvertible symmetry
algebra. These analytical predictions are corroborated by numerical
calculations of the Ising model, where boundaries and topological defects are
described by Cardy states and Verlinde lines, respectively.

### [3] [Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10661)
*David Shnaiderov,Matan Ben Dov,Yoav Woldiger,Assaf Hamo,Eugene Demler,Emanuele G. Dalla Torre*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过优化Ramsey干涉实验来估计量子比特失谐和串扰参数的方法，显著减少了校准时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子处理器中串扰的存在使单个量子比特失谐的估计复杂化，需要高效校准策略。

Method: 利用Fisher信息和Cramer-Rao界优化Ramsey干涉实验，比较了多种校准协议。

Result: 实验验证表明，双正交单时间测量方法在精度和鲁棒性上最优，校准时间减少50%。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效准确地提取参数，适用于孤立和耦合量子比特系统。

Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining
the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the
presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit
detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning
and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using
Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration
protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and
of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements.
Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and
robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate
experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting
transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with
significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50\% reduction in
calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.

### [4] [Entanglement and Purity in Open Systems: A Breakdown of the Lindblad Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10668)
*Raoul Serao,Aniello Quaranta,Antonio Capolupo,Fabio Franchini,Salvatore Marco Giampaolo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了Lindblad主方程在描述开放量子系统中纠缠和纯度的短时动力学时的有效性，发现其预测与微观处理结果存在差异，并指出有效模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Lindblad主方程在描述开放量子系统短时动力学时的准确性，特别是纠缠和纯度的变化。

Method: 比较Lindblad方法和全微观处理方法，分析两种方法对两个相互作用的两能级系统与环境的动力学预测。

Result: Lindblad方法预测线性纯度衰减并可能完全抑制纠缠，而微观处理显示纠缠增长和二次纯度衰减。时间依赖性Lindblad方法部分改进预测但引入不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了有效模型的局限性，提醒在描述微妙量子行为时需谨慎使用。

Abstract: We examine the effectiveness of Lindblad master equation in capturing the
short-time dynamics of entanglement and purity in open quantum systems.
Focusing on two interacting two-level systems interacting with a larger
environment, we compare the Lindbladian approach to a full microscopic
treatment. While the latter shows entanglement growth and a quadratic decay of
purity, the Lindbladian method predicts a linear purity decay and can entirely
suppress entanglement when the dissipative coupling exceeds the interaction
strength. Introducing a time-dependent Lindbladian improves some predictions
but causes inconsistencies in other observables. Our results highlight the
limitations of effective models and the need for caution when applying them to
describe subtle quantum behaviors.

### [5] [Optimal quantum transport on a ring via locally monitored chiral quantum walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10669)
*Sara Finocchiaro,Giovanni Luilli,Giuliano Benenti,Matteo G. A. Paris,Luca Razzoli*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究通过手性和局部监测优化环形网络中的量子传输，避免破坏性干涉，提高检测概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决相干传输中破坏性干涉导致传输概率低的问题，提出无需精细调谐时间或初始态的方法。

Method: 采用手性量子行走和局部监测（目标位点的投影测量），分析手性与测量频率的相互作用。

Result: 通过Perron-Frobenius算子的谱性质和暗态分析，确定了最大化检测概率的最优条件。

Conclusion: 该方法为监测系统中量子传输的增强提供了通用框架。

Abstract: In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can
significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values
through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state
preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a
ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk.
Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a
directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local
monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target
site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of
the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and
measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the
asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol
relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which
capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark
states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport
in monitored systems.

### [6] [Entanglement production in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model and its variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10892)
*Tanay Pathak,Masaki Tezuka*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了三种SYK模型变体在有限N下的纠缠动力学，发现其早期线性增长率和饱和值一致，但增长率不同，反映了不同程度的混沌行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解量子混沌系统的纠缠生成机制，以区分不同混沌行为类别。

Method: 使用von Neumann纠缠熵分析非纠缠态在三种SYK模型变体中的演化。

Result: 所有变体早期线性增长，晚期饱和值符合RMT，但增长率不同，且随N增大差异逐渐显现。

Conclusion: 纠缠生成速率可作为混沌的精细探针，且N增大时与RMT预测存在偏差。

Abstract: Understanding how quantum chaotic systems generate entanglement can provide
insight into their microscopic chaotic dynamics and can help distinguish
between different classes of chaotic behavior. Using von Neumann entanglement
entropy, we study a nonentangled state evolved under three variants of the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with a finite number of Majorana fermions $N$.
All the variants exhibit linear entanglement growth at early times, which at
late times saturates to a universal value consistent with random matrix theory
(RMT), but their growth rates differ. We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect,
arising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary
SYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that
these differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants
are quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of
chaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a
fine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect
on thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point
autocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but
deviations from RMT predictions for $N \geq 24$, particularly near the
crossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.

### [7] [Data-insenstive cooling of polar molecules with Rydberg atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10671)
*Jeremy T. Young,Ron Belyansky,Kang-Kuen Ni,Alexey V. Gorshkov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用里德堡原子对极性分子进行冷却的方法，同时保持分子中的量子信息。通过设计状态无关的相互作用，实现了对极性分子的相干冷却。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决极性分子在量子计算和模拟中因热运动导致的信息丢失问题，提出了一种新的冷却方法。

Method: 通过选择合适的内部状态和施加外部场，设计出状态无关的相互作用（范德华力或偶极相互作用），实现极性分子与冷原子之间的声子交换冷却。

Result: 成功实现了对极性分子的相干冷却，且不影响其内部量子态。

Conclusion: 该方法为混合光镊阵列中的量子计算和模拟提供了更长的操作时间。

Abstract: We propose a method to sympathetically cool polar molecules with Rydberg
atoms without destroying the quantum information encoded in the polar
molecules. While the interactions between the two are usually state-dependent,
we show how to engineer state-insensitive interactions between the hot
molecules and the cold atoms with a suitable choice of internal states and the
application of external fields. The resulting interactions, which may be van
der Waals or dipolar, induce a phonon swap interaction between the two species,
thereby coherently cooling the polar molecules without affecting the internal
state, a process which can be repeated if the atoms are cooled again or new
cold atoms are brought in. Our cooling schemes open the possibility of
extending quantum computation and simulation times in emerging hybrid tweezer
arrays of polar molecules and neutral atoms.

### [8] [Higher spin Richardson-Gaudin model with time-dependent coupling: Exact dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10856)
*Suvendu Barik,Lieuwe Bakker,Vladimir Gritsev,Jiří Minář,Emil A. Yuzbashyan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了自旋-$s$ Richardson-Gaudin模型在时间反比耦合下的渐近多体波函数，发现其不能通过合并自旋从自旋-$1/2$情况推导，且稳态非热，不符合广义吉布斯系综。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自旋-$s$模型在时间依赖耦合下的动力学行为及其与自旋-$1/2$情况的差异。

Method: 分析了时间演化从$t = 0^+$基态开始的渐近波函数，并验证了平均场理论对有限自旋算符乘积的精确性。

Result: 发现稳态非热，且不能通过自旋合并从自旋-$1/2$情况推导，平均场理论对有限自旋算符乘积精确。

Conclusion: 研究结果可通过腔QED和囚禁离子实验验证，揭示了自旋-$s$模型的独特动力学行为。

Abstract: We determine the exact asymptotic many-body wavefunction of a spin-$s$
Richardson-Gaudin model with a coupling inversely proportional to time, for
time evolution starting from the ground state at $t = 0^+$ and for arbitrary
$s$. Contrary to common belief, the resulting wavefunction cannot be derived
from the spin-$1/2$ case by merging spins, but instead requires independent
treatment for each spin size. The steady state is non-thermal and, in contrast
to the spin-$1/2$ case, does not conform to a natural Generalized Gibbs
Ensemble. We show that mean-field theory is exact for any product of a finite
number of spin operators on different sites. We discuss how these findings can
be probed in cavity QED and trapped ion experiments.

### [9] [Mesoscopic Fluctuations and Multifractality at and across Measurement-Induced Phase Transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11312)
*Igor Poboiko,Igor V. Gornyi,Alexander D. Mirlin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究二维自由费米子在局域电荷测量下的统计涨落，发现其与安德森局域化类似，揭示了测量诱导相变中的普适性和多分形统计特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索测量诱导相变中量子轨迹的统计涨落，揭示其与安德森局域化的类比及其普适性。

Method: 通过研究粒子数协方差$G_{AB}$和两点密度关联函数$\mathcal{C}(r)$，分析不同相中的涨落行为。

Result: 在离域相中$G_{AB}$呈现高斯涨落，局域相中$G_{AB}$分布广泛且方差随系统尺寸变化，相变点处$G_{AB}$具有尺度不变性且$\mathcal{C}(r)$呈现多分形统计。

Conclusion: 研究为监测系统的介观理论奠定了基础，并为进一步扩展提供了方向。

Abstract: We explore statistical fluctuations over the ensemble of quantum trajectories
in a model of two-dimensional free fermions subject to projective monitoring of
local charge across the measurement-induced phase transition. Our observables
are the particle-number covariance between spatially separated regions,
$G_{AB}$, and the two-point density correlation function, $\mathcal{C}(r)$. Our
results exhibit a remarkable analogy to Anderson localization, with $G_{AB}$
corresponding to two-terminal conductance and $\mathcal{C}(r)$ to two-point
conductance, albeit with different replica limit and unconventional symmetry
class, geometry, and boundary conditions. In the delocalized phase, $G_{AB}$
exhibits ``universal'', nearly Gaussian, fluctuations with variance of order
unity. In the localized phase, we find a broad distribution of $G_{AB}$ with
$\overline{-\ln G_{AB}} \sim L $ (where $L$ is the system size) and the
variance $\mathrm{var}(\ln G_{AB}) \sim L^\mu$, and similarly for
$\mathcal{C}(r)$, with $\mu \approx 0.5$. At the transition point, the
distribution function of $G_{AB}$ becomes scale-invariant and $\mathcal{C}(r)$
exhibits multifractal statistics, $\overline{\mathcal{C}^{q}(r)}\sim r^{-q(d+1)
- \Delta_{q}}$. We characterize the spectrum of multifractal dimensions
$\Delta_q$. Our findings lay the groundwork for mesoscopic theory of monitored
systems, paving the way for various extensions.

### [10] [Manarat: A Scalable QICK-Based Control System for Superconducting Quantum Processors Supporting Synchronized Control of 10 Flux-Tunable Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10676)
*Agustin Silva,Alvaro Orgaz-Fuertes*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Manarat是一个基于QICK的可扩展多板控制平台，通过硬件、固件和软件增强实现多AMD ZCU216 RFSoC板之间的亚100 ps时序对齐，支持超导量子处理器的规模化操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子比特数量的增加和多比特操作的复杂性提升，现有的QICK框架缺乏多板同步支持，限制了其在中大规模量子设备中的应用。

Method: Manarat通过低抖动时钟分配网络、tProcessor修改和同步方案实现多板时序对齐，并集成定制模拟前端用于通量控制。软件栈支持同步多板实验，并与Qibo框架集成。

Conclusion: Manarat为超导量子计算机的规模化操作提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: A scalable control architecture for superconducting quantum processors is
essential as the number of qubits increases and coherent multi-qubit operations
span beyond the capacity of a single control module. The Quantum
Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK), built on AMD RFSoC platforms, offers a
flexible open-source framework for pulse-level qubit control but lacks native
support for multi-board synchronization, limiting its applicability to mid- and
large-scale quantum devices. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Manarat,
a scalable multi-board control platform based on QICK that incorporates
hardware, firmware, and software enhancements to enable sub-100 ps timing
alignment across multiple AMD ZCU216 RFSoC boards. Our system integrates a
low-jitter clock distribution network, modifications to the tProcessor, and a
synchronization scheme to ensure deterministic alignment of program execution
across boards. It also includes a custom analog front-end for flux control that
combines high-speed RF signals with software-programmable DC biasing voltages
generated by a low-noise, high-precision DAC. These capabilities are
complemented by a software stack capable of orchestrating synchronized
multi-board experiments and fully integrated with the open-source Qibo
framework for quantum device calibration and algorithm execution. We validate
Manarat on a 10-qubit superconducting processor controlled by two RFSoC boards,
demonstrating reliable execution of synchronized control sequences for
cross-board CZ gate calibration. These results confirm that sub-nanosecond
synchronization and coherent control is achievable across multiple RFSoC
boards, enabling scalable operation of superconducting quantum computers.

Conclusion: 霍金时间晶体为量子系统中的自发对称性破缺提供了新视角。

Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a time crystal in a quantum black-hole
laser (BHL), where the genuine spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking
stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The
resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic
dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while
equal-time correlations are time-independent because they embody averages over
different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded
as a nonlinear periodic version of the Andreev-Hawking effect, signaled by
anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs
of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions.

Method: 使用稳定子Rényi熵（SRE）量化魔幻性，通过完美采样算法进行数值计算。

Result: SRE在临界相到面积律相时仍保持广延性，但魔幻性结构发生离域化相变；SRE的弛豫时间在临界相中与系统尺寸线性增长。

Conclusion: 魔幻性结构的离域化相变与纠缠熵的标度行为一致，临界相的弛豫动力学具有普适性。

Abstract: We investigate magic and its connection to entanglement in 1+1 dimensional
random free fermion circuits, with a focus on hybrid free fermion dynamics that
can exhibit an entanglement phase transition. To quantify magic, we use the
Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), which we compute numerically via a perfect
sampling algorithm. We show that although the SRE remains extensive as the
system transitions from a critical phase to an area-law (disentangled) phase,
the structure of magic itself undergoes a delocalization phase transition. This
transition is characterized using the bipartite stabilizer mutual information,
which exhibits the same scaling behavior as entanglement entropy: logarithmic
scaling in the critical phase and a finite constant in the area-law phase.
Additionally, we explore the dynamics of SRE. While the total SRE becomes
extensive in $O(1)$ time, we find that in the critical phase, the relaxation
time to the steady-state value is parameterically longer than that in generic
random circuits. The relaxation follows a universal form, with a relaxation
time that grows linearly with the system size, providing further evidence for
the critical nature of the phase.

Conclusion: 局部可区分态在某些情况下具有潜在应用价值，且其转化条件为量子信息处理提供了新的分类视角。

Abstract: A set of orthogonal quantum states is said to be locally indistinguishable if
they cannot be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical
communication (LOCC). Otherwise, the states are locally distinguishable.
However, locally indistinguishable states may find applications in information
processing protocols. In this sense, locally indistinguishable states are
useful. On the other hand, it is usual to consider that locally distinguishable
states are useless. Nevertheless, recent works suggest that locally
distinguishable states should be given due consideration as in certain
situations these states can be converted to locally indistinguishable states
under orthogonality-preserving LOCC (OP-LOCC). Such a counterintuitive
phenomenon motivates us to ask when the aforesaid conversion is possible and
when it is not. In this work, we provide different structures of locally
distinguishable product and entangled states which do not allow the aforesaid
conversion. We also provide certain structures of locally distinguishable
states which allow the aforesaid conversion. In this way, we classify the
locally distinguishable sets by introducing hierarchies among them. In a
multipartite system, this study becomes more involved as there exist
multipartite locally distinguishable sets which cannot be converted to locally
indistinguishable sets by OP-LOCC across any bipartition. We say this as ``no
activation across bi-partitions".

Result: 该方法生成的纠缠态可显著提升量子传感器的灵敏度，并分析了原子涨落的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子增强计量学提供了一种新的可扩展纠缠态生成方案。

Abstract: Quantum effects, such as entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, and
Bell correlations, can enhance metrological sensitivity beyond the standard
quantum limit. These correlations are typically generated through interactions
between atoms or molecules, or during the passage of a laser pulse through a
birefringent crystal. Here, we consider an alternative method of generating
scalable, many-body entangled states, and demonstrate their usability for
quantum-enhanced metrology. Our setup is a one-dimensional (1D) array of
double-well potentials holding independent and uncorrelated Bose-Einstein
condensates. The beam-splitting transformation mixes the signal between
adjacent wells and yields a strongly entangled state through a many-body
equivalent of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We demonstrate this entanglement can
improve the sensitivity of quantum sensors. In our analysis, we account for the
effects of atomic fluctuations and identify the optimal measurement that
saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound.

Abstract: Algorithm and hardware-aware compilation co-design is essential for the
efficient deployment of near-term quantum programs. We present a compilation
case-study implementing QCrank -- an efficient encoding protocol for storing
sequenced real-valued classical data in a quantum state -- targeting neutral
atom-based Dynamically Programmable Qubit Arrays (DPQAs). We show how key
features of neutral-atom arrays such as high qubits count, operation
parallelism, multi-zone architecture, and natively reconfigurable connectivity
can be used to inform effective algorithm deployment. We identify algorithmic
and circuit features that signal opportunities to implement them in a
hardware-efficient manner. To evaluate projected hardware performance, we
define a realistic noise model for DPQAs using parameterized Pauli channels,
implement it in Qiskit circuit simulators, and assess QCrank's accuracy for
writing and reading back 24-320 real numbers into 6-20 qubits. We compare DPQA
results with simulated performances of Quantinuum's H1-1E and with experimental
results from IBM Fez, highlighting promising accuracy scaling for DPQAs.

Abstract: This paper constructs the first quantum algorithm for wavelet packet
transforms with a tree structure, sometimes called wave atom transforms.
Classically, wave atoms are used to construct sparse representations of
differential operators, which enable fast numerical algorithms for partial
differential equations. Compared to previous work, our quantum algorithm can

efficient representation for a larger class of possible tree structures. Our
quantum implementation has $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ gate complexity for the
transform of dimension $2^n$, while classical implementations have $O(n 2^n)$
floating point operations. The result can be used to improve existing quantum
algorithms for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种低成本协议，用于大规模Pauli Path模拟器（PPS）实验的运行时和内存估计，并探讨了PPS作为科学发现工具的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PPS是否可以作为科学发现工具，而非仅用于验证已知结果，同时提供运行时和内存估计的实用方法。

Method: 分析Heisenberg图像中Pauli系数的动态特性，发现其收敛规律，并基于此提出框架以理解PPS的收敛性。

Result: 发现减小截断参数δ并不总能提高精度，且深度量子电路可能比浅层电路更容易模拟。

Conclusion: 为PPS的可靠性和应用场景提供了实用指南，并发布了BlueQubit SDK工具包。

Abstract: In this this paper we present an inexpensive protocol to perform runtime and
memory estimation for large-scale experiments with Pauli Path simulators (PPS).
Additionally, we propose a conceptually simple solution for studying whether
PPS can be used as a scientific discovery tool, rather than reproducing
existing answers. We start by analyzing the dynamics of the Pauli coefficients
tracked in the Heisenberg picture. In addition to surprisingly generic
convergence features of the Pauli coefficient distributions, we find certain
regularities that allow for extrapolation of memory and runtime requirements
for smaller and smaller coefficient truncation parameter $\delta$. We then
introduce a framework for understanding convergence in the absence of rigorous
error guarantees on PPS. Combined with runtime analysis, we propose bifurcating
quantum simulation problems broadly into two classes, based on whether there is
apparent convergence of expectation values as a function of $\delta$. This
serves as a way for practitioners to understand where their problem falls on
the frontier of classical simulability. In the case without apparent
convergence, PPS may still serve useful as a Monte Carlo-like estimate. Applied
to IBM's utility-scale experiments, we show parameter regimes where both
behaviors are realized. Some of our key findings challenge conventional
intuition: reducing $\delta$ does not always improve accuracy, and deeper
quantum circuits may actually be easier to simulate than shallower ones. The
BlueQubit SDK implementing these methods has been released publicly, offering
researchers a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating this frontier classical
simulation approach. These results establish practical guidelines for when PPS
can serve as a reliable verification tool versus when it should be used as a
complementary estimate alongside quantum experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨光前量子场论中量子资源（如纠缠和魔法态）的利用方式，并与瞬时形式进行比较。

Method: 使用(1+1)D横向场Ising模型，推导LF能量算子并分析其动力学特性，比较LF和IF基态的纠缠和魔法态需求。

Result: LF基态在动量空间可分离且需要更少魔法态资源，而IF基态在动量空间呈现最大纠缠。

Conclusion: LF量子模拟比IF更高效，基态更简单且资源需求更低。

Abstract: In the light-front (LF) formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), physics is
formulated from the perspective of a massless observer necessarily traveling at
the speed of light. The LF formulation provides an alternative computational
approach to lattice gauge theory, and has recently been investigated as a
future application of quantum computers. A natural question is how quantum
resources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the
laboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D
transverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy
operator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from
the instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF
Hamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta
in IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF
momentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the
IF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to
prepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point,
corresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are
stabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while
the IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF
momentum-space. These results show that quantum resources such as entanglement
and magic are utilized differently by quantum simulations formulated in LF and
IF, and that the simplicity of the LF ground state results in fewer required
quantum resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子通道的存储与检索任务，特别是针对等距通道，探索更高效的实现方法。

Method: 分析了基于估计的策略的渐近性能，并提出了一种基于端口隐形传态的协议。

Result: 发现基于估计的策略对等距通道次优，而新协议仅需$n = \Theta(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$查询即可实现存储。

Conclusion: 新协议显著提高了效率，并扩展应用于一般量子通道，改进了先前的研究结果。

Abstract: Storage and retrieval refer to the task of encoding a quantum channel
$\Lambda$ into a quantum state, known as the program state, such that the
channel can later be retrieved. This task is closely related to quantum channel
estimation, where multiple queries to $\Lambda$ are used to prepare a quantum
state $\phi_\Lambda$ that encodes information about the channel. The channel
can then be retrieved by measuring $\phi_\Lambda$, following a
measure-and-prepare strategy. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic
performance of the estimation-based strategy for storage and retrieval of
isometry channels. We show that the optimal fidelity for isometry estimation is
given by $F = 1-{d(D-d)\over n} + O(n^{-2})$, where $d$ and $D$ denote the
input and output dimensions of the isometry, and $n$ is the number of queries.
This result indicates that, unlike in the case of unitary channels, the
estimation-based strategy is suboptimal for the storage and retrieval of
isometry channels, which requires $n = \Theta(\epsilon^{-1})$ to achieve the
diamond-norm error $\epsilon$. To address this limitation, we propose a more
efficient protocol based on port-based teleportation, which stores the isometry
channel in a program state using only $n = \Theta(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ queries.
As an application, we extend our approach to general quantum channels,
achieving improved program cost compared to prior results by Gschwedtner,
Bluhm, and Winter [Quantum $\textbf{5}$, 488 (2021)].

Conclusion: 非局域相关性在经典通信任务中具有显著优势，为量子通信提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We reveal key connections between non-locality and advantage in
correlation-assisted classical communication. First, using the wire-cutting
technique, we provide a Bell inequality tailored to any correlation-assisted
bounded classical communication task. The violation of this inequality by a
quantum correlation is equivalent to its quantum-assisted advantage in the
corresponding communication task. Next, we introduce wire-reading, which
leverages the readability of classical messages to demonstrate advantageous
assistance of non-local correlations in setups where no such advantage can be
otherwise observed. Building on this, we introduce families of classical
communication tasks in a Bob-without-input prepare-and-measure scenario, where
non-local correlation enhances bounded classical communication while shared
randomness assistance yields strictly suboptimal payoff. For the first family
of tasks, assistance from any non-local facet leads to optimal payoff, while
each task in the second family is tailored to a non-local facet. We reveal
quantum advantage in these tasks, including qutrit over qubit entanglement
advantage.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In quantum resource theories (QRTs) certain quantum states and operations are
deemed more valuable than others. While the determination of the ``free''
elements is usually guided by the constraints of some experimental setup, this
can make it difficult to study similarities and differences between QRTs. In
this work, we argue that QRTs follow from the choice of a preferred algebraic
structure $\mathcal{E}$ to be preserved, thus setting the free operations as
the automorphisms of $\mathcal{E}$. We illustrate our finding by determining
$\mathcal{E}$ for the QRTs of entanglement, Clifford stabilizerness, purity,
imaginarity, fermionic Gaussianity, reference frames, thermodynamics and
coherence; showing instances where $\mathcal{E}$ is a Lie algebra, group, ring,
or even a simple set. This unified understanding allows us to generalize the
concept of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) to
identify novel resource non-increasing operations for Lie-algebra based QRTs,
thus finding a new solution to an open problem in the literature. We showcase
the sanity of our new set of operations by rigorously proving that they map
free states to free states, as well as determine more general situations where
these transformations strictly do not increase the resource of a state.

Conclusion: 该方法在高维预测任务中表现出高精度和有效性。

Abstract: A time-series forecasting method for high-dimensional spatial data is
proposed. The method involves optimal selection of sparse sensor positions to
efficiently represent the spatial domain, time-series forecasting at these
positions, and estimation of the entire spatial distribution from the
forecasted values via a learned decoder. Sensor positions are selected using a
method based on combinatorial optimization. Introducing multi-parallelized
quantum long short-term memory (MP-QLSTM) and gated recurrent unit (MP-QGRU)
improves time-series forecasting performance by extending QLSTM models using
the same number of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) as the cell state
dimensions. Unlike the original QLSTM, our method fully measures all qubits in
each VQC, maximizing the representation capacity. MP-QLSTM and MP-QGRU achieve
approximately 1.5% lower test loss than classical LSTM and GRU. The root mean
squared percentage error of MP-QLSTM is 0.256% against the values measured
independently using semiconductor pressure sensors, demonstrating the method's
accuracy and effectiveness for high-dimensional forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: 参数转移技术为QAOA和RQAOA提供了高效且可靠的优化方法，适用于特定问题类。

Abstract: The classical outer optimisation loop of the classical-quantum hybrid Quantum
Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) can be bypassed by transferring
precomputed parameters to larger unseen problem instances using the parameter
concentration property found in certain classes of problem instances. In this
paper, parameter transfer is applied to the recursive-QAOA (RQAOA) approach of
Bravyi et al. implementing the Binary Paint Shop Problem (BPSP) -- an
optimisation problem found in manufacturing where a sequence of cars are to be
painted under certain constraints while minimising the number of colour changes
between cars. The BPSP can be conveniently formulated as an Ising ground state
problem with a symmetric Hamiltonian and Ising graph structure that is
well-suited for QAOA parameter-transfer techniques. Throughout our quantum
simulated experiments, parameter transfer showed no noticeable reduction in
solution quality over optimisation for QAOA and RQAOA while substantially
improving the efficiency due to avoiding measurements required for
optimisation. Additionally, RQAOA only requires measurements of
$ZZ$-correlations instead of full statevectors, benefiting from the
reverse-causal-cone feature that leads to circuits with significantly lower
CNOT counts and depths. The performance of QAOA and RQAOA with parameter
transfer is benchmarked against classical solvers and heuristics and their
resilience to non-optimal parameters is explored. The entanglement entropy and
bond dimensions are obtained from matrix product state simulations to provide
an indication of the classical resources required to simulate the quantum
algorithms. Circuit sizes and measurement counts are compared between the
implementations.

Conclusion: 量子算法在解决MVSDEs时展现出显著的速度优势，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo integration, a quantum algorithm for calculating
expectations that provides a quadratic speed-up compared to its classical
counterpart, is now attracting increasing interest in the context of its
industrial and scientific applications. In this paper, we propose the first
application of QMCI to solving McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations
(MVSDEs), a nonlinear class of SDEs whose drift and diffusion coefficients
depend on the law $\mu_t$ of the solution $X_t$ -- appearing in fields such as
finance and fluid mechanics. We focus on the problem setting where the
coefficients depend on $\mu_t$ through expectations of some functions
$\mathbb{E}[\varphi_k(X_t)]$, and the goal is to compute the expectation of a
function $\mathbb{E}[\phi(X_T)]$ at a terminal time $T$. We devise a quantum
algorithm that leverages QMCI to compute these expectations, combined with a
high-order time discretization method for SDEs and extrapolation of the
expectations in time. The proposed algorithm estimates $\mathbb{E}[\phi(X_T)]$
with accuracy $\epsilon$, making $O(1/\epsilon^{1+2/p})$ queries to the quantum
circuit for time evolution over one step, where $p\in(1,2]$ is the weak order
of the SDE discretization method. This demonstrates the speed-up over the
well-known classical algorithm called the particle method with complexity of
$O(1/\epsilon^3)$. We conduct a numerical demonstration of our quantum
algorithm applied to an example of MVSDEs, with some parts emulated
classically, and observe that the accuracy and complexity behave as expected.

Abstract: We present a two-level decomposition strategy to enhance the quality and
performance of Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) for practical image
analysis on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. A Data-Level
Decomposition partitions an input image into P augmented sub-images, each
encoded into a separate quantum circuit. Each of these circuits is then further
cut via Circuit-Level Decomposition into Q smaller sub-circuits suitable for
execution on near-term quantum devices. The two-level P $\times$ Q
decomposition, along with optimizations we introduced, achieves over 62\%
reductions in circuit depth and approximately 93\% fewer two-qubit operations,
while maintaining a fidelity exceeding 95.6\% under realistic IBM noise models
for 5-qubit data input sizes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
performing high-fidelity QHED on NISQ hardware and provide lessons and early
evidence of distributed utility scale quantum computing, further illustrated by
processing raw k-space MRI data with an Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform and a
distributed simulation of the modified QHED on large 2D and 3D MRI datasets.

Abstract: Self-correcting quantum memories store logical quantum information for
exponential time in thermal equilibrium at low temperatures. By definition,
these systems are slow mixing. This raises the question of how the memory
state, which we refer to as the Gibbs state within a logical sector, is created
in the first place.
  In this paper, we show that for a broad class of self-correcting quantum
memories on lattices with parity check redundancies, a quasi-local quantum
Gibbs sampler rapidly converges to the corresponding low-temperature Gibbs
state within a logical sector when initialized from a ground state. This
illustrates a dynamical view of self-correcting quantum memories, where the
"syndrome sector" rapidly converges to thermal equilibrium, while the "logical
sector" remains metastable. As a key application, when initialized from a
random ground state, this gives a rapid Gibbs state preparation algorithm for
the 4D toric code in $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ depth. The main technical
ingredients behind our approach are new, low-temperature decay-of-correlation
properties for these metastable states.

ANASTAARS iteratively constructs random interpolation models within
low-dimensional affine subspaces defined via Johnson--Lindenstrauss transforms.
This adaptive strategy allows the selective reuse of previously acquired
measurements, significantly reducing computational costs associated with shot
acquisition. Furthermore, to robustly handle noisy measurements, ANASTAARS
incorporates noise-aware optimization techniques by estimating noise magnitude
and adjusts trust-region steps accordingly. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the practical scalability of the proposed method for near-term quantum

Result: NLE总是≤LE；三组件系统中NLE与LE差异不大，但四组件及以上系统中差异可能显著；经典相关性是NLE的下界。

Conclusion: NLE是一种有效的局部纠缠度量，其与传统LE的关系和差异为理解多组件系统中的纠缠提供了新视角。

Abstract: In this study, we have addressed an ambiguity in the concept of localizable
entanglement (LE) introduced by Verstraete et al in 2004. By doing so, we have
proposed and explored a unique form of this entanglement, called new
localizable entanglement (NLE). We have shown that NLE is always less than or
equal to LE. Additionally, we have demonstrated that for systems with three
components, NLE does not differ significantly from LE. However, when the number
of components increases to four, there is a possibility of significant
differences between the two methods. Furthermore, as the number of components
increases further, this difference becomes slightly more pronounced. It appears
that the classical correlation, which is the lower bound for LE, is also a
lower bound for NLE.

### [34] [On the Fundamental Resource for Exponential Advantage in Quantum Channel Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11089)
*Minsoo Kim,Changhun Oh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了量子记忆中的纠缠和辅助量子比特对量子学习任务的不同贡献，发现少量纠缠即可高效学习，而辅助量子比特数量不足则需指数级样本复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子记忆中的纠缠和辅助量子比特在量子学习任务中的定量作用，以更深入理解量子学习优势的本质。

Method: 通过分析Pauli信道学习任务，区分纠缠和辅助量子比特的作用，并证明其各自对样本复杂度的影响。

Result: 少量纠缠即可实现多项式复杂度的学习，而辅助量子比特不足则导致指数级复杂度。

Conclusion: 量子记忆的维度是关键资源，而大量纠缠并非必要，揭示了量子学习优势的不同资源贡献。

Abstract: Quantum resources enable us to achieve an exponential advantage in learning
the properties of unknown physical systems by employing quantum memory. While
entanglement with quantum memory is recognized as a necessary qualitative
resource, its quantitative role remains less understood. In this work, we
distinguish between two fundamental resources provided by quantum memory --
entanglement and ancilla qubits -- and analyze their separate contributions to
the sampling complexity of quantum learning. Focusing on the task of Pauli
channel learning, a prototypical example of quantum channel learning,
remarkably, we prove that vanishingly small entanglement in the input state
already suffices to accomplish the learning task with only a polynomial number
of channel queries in the number of qubits. In contrast, we show that without a
sufficient number of ancilla qubits, even learning partial information about
the channel demands an exponentially large sample complexity. Thus, our
findings reveal that while a large amount of entanglement is not necessary, the
dimension of the quantum memory is a crucial resource. Hence, by identifying
how the two resources contribute differently, our work offers deeper insight
into the nature of the quantum learning advantage.

Conclusion: GQSP框架结合了可扩展性、灵活性和鲁棒收敛性，为容错量子设备上的初始态制备提供了实用方案。

Abstract: We present a unifying framework for quantum power-method-based algorithms
through the lens of generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP): we apply GQSP
to realize quantum analogues of classical power iteration, power Lanczos,
inverse iteration, and folded spectrum methods, all within a single coherent
framework. Our approach is efficient in terms of the number of queries to the
block encoding of a Hamiltonian. Also, our approach can avoid Suzuki-Trotter
decomposition. We constructed quantum circuits for GQSP-based quantum power
methods, estimated the number of queries, and numerically verified that this
framework works. We additionally benchmark various quantum power methods with
molecular Hamiltonians and demonstrate that Quantum Power Lanczos converges
faster and more reliably than standard Quantum Power Iteration, while Quantum
Inverse Iteration outperforms existing inverse iteration variants based on
time-evolution operators. We also show that the Quantum Folded Spectrum Method
can obtain excited states without variational optimization. Overall, our
results indicate that GQSP-based implementations of power methods combine
scalability, flexibility, and robust convergence, paving the way for practical
initial state preparations on fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Abstract: Entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information science, serving as a
key resource for quantum communication, computation, and metrology.
Consequently, high-precision entangled state preparation and efficient
verification are essential for practical quantum technologies. Quantum state
verification (QSV) has recently gained much attention as an efficient and
experiment-friendly approach for verifying entangled states. In this work, we
experimentally demonstrate a QSV protocol for verifying three-qubit
nonstabilizer $W$ state via a modified homogeneous strategy. Notably, our
implementation extends QSV beyond its standard role by integrating the state
preparation process, thus guiding and validating the real-time generation of
high-fidelity target states. Specifically, we realize the efficient
verification with a favorable scaling of the required number of copies versus
infidelity as $-1.39$, outperforming the standard quantum limit of $-2$.
Meanwhile, a fidelity of $97.07(\pm 0.26)\%$ via direct estimation is achieved
using only $9$ measurement settings and $10^4$ samples, which is independently
confirmed by quantum state tomography to be $98.58(\pm 0.12)\%$ with
approximately $10^6$ measurements. This work presents the first experimental
demonstration of QSV actively assisted with state preparation, establishing it
as a powerful and resource-efficient alternative to full tomography for
real-time quantum state engineering.

Method: 采用单向量子比特传输方法，利用四粒子簇态，使量子用户与两个经典用户同时建立密钥。

Result: 协议更轻量且实用，安全性接近完全量子协议，噪声容忍度接近BB84协议。

Conclusion: 该协议在轻量化和安全性方面优于现有方案，适用于量子受限环境。

Abstract: This study proposes a new lightweight quantum key distribution (LQKD)
protocol based on the four-particle cluster state within a quantum-restricted
environment. The protocol enables a quantum-capable user to simultaneously
establish two separate secret keys with two "classical" users, who are limited
to performing only the Hadamard operation and measurements in the $Z$ basis. By
adopting a one-way qubit transmission approach, the proposed protocol addresses
several limitations of existing semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) schemes
that rely on two-way or circular transmission methods: (1) it eliminates the
need for classical participants to be equipped with costly quantum devices to
defend against quantum Trojan horse attacks; (2) it reduces the qubit
transmission distance; and (3) it achieves higher qubit efficiency.
Consequently, the proposed three-party LQKD protocol is both more lightweight
and practical than existing SQKD protocols. Furthermore, the security analysis
shows that, in the ideal case, the protocol achieves the same level of security
as fully quantum protocols. Finally, the study proves the unconditional
security of the protocol in the non-ideal case, demonstrating a noise tolerance
close to that of the BB84 protocol.

Abstract: A long-standing problem in quantum physics is to determine the minimal number

arbitrary $d$-dimensional quantum state. As a proof-of-principle, we
experimentally verified this scheme on a silicon photonic chip by
reconstructing quantum states for $d=6$, in which a complete set of mutually
unbiased bases does not exist. This approach offers new perspectives for
quantum state characterization and measurement design, and holds promise for
future applications in quantum information processing.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Quantum Adaptive Excitation Network (QAE-Net),
a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to enhance channel attention
mechanisms in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). QAE-Net replaces the
classical excitation block of Squeeze-and-Excitation modules with a shallow
Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC), leveraging quantum superposition and
entanglement to capture higher-order inter-channel dependencies that are
challenging to model with purely classical approaches. We evaluate QAE-Net on
benchmark image classification tasks, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, and
CIFAR-10, and observe consistent performance improvements across all datasets,
with particularly notable gains on tasks involving three-channel inputs.
Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of
variational layers in the quantum circuit leads to progressively higher
classification accuracy, underscoring the expressivity benefits of deeper
quantum models. These findings highlight the potential of integrating VQCs into
CNN architectures to improve representational capacity while maintaining
compatibility with near-term quantum devices. The proposed approach is tailored
for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, offering a scalable and
feasible pathway for deploying quantum-enhanced attention mechanisms in

Conclusion: 新协议在实用量子密钥分发系统中提供高级安全性。

Abstract: Correlation between different pulses is a nettlesome problem in quantum key
distribution (QKD). All existing solutions for this problem need to
characterize the strength of the correlation, which may reduce the security of
QKD to an accurate characterization. In this article, we propose a new protocol
immune to all correlations of all dimensions, with the only requirements of
non-entangled and finite-ranged correlation, and bounded vacuum probability.
Additionally, the new protocol is side-channel-secure and
measurement-device-independent, giving high-level security in practical QKD
systems. We provide the finite-key security analysis against coherent attacks
and conduct numerical simulations to see the performance. The result shows that
a small correlation range does not influence the performance a lot and the
protocol could tolerate a large correlation range, such as correlations
spanning over 500 pulses.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information theoretic security based
on quantum mechanics, however, its practical deployment is challenged by
imperfections of source devices. Among various source loopholes, correlations
between transmitted pulses pose a significant yet underexplored security risk,
potentially compromising QKD's theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose
a security analysis framework for QKD under correlations, enabling finite-key
analysis for the first time by extending and rearranging QKD rounds and
leveraging the generalized chain rule. Based on this framework, and inspired by
the idea of side-channel-secure QKD, we develop a secure QKD against correlated
leakage source only need the characterization of correlation range and the
lower bound on the vacuum component of the prepared states. Additionally, our
framework can be extended to other QKD protocols, offering a general approach
to consider correlation induced security vulnerabilities. The simulation
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol and its significantly
superior tolerance to imperfect parameters compared to existing protocols. This
work provides a crucial step toward closing security loopholes in QKD,
enhancing its practicality, and ensuring long-distance,high-performance secure
communication under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has unveiled a realm of exotic phenomena absent in
Hermitian systems, with the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) showcasing
boundary-localized eigenstates driven by non-reciprocal interactions. Here, we
introduce a new class of non-Hermitian systems exhibiting pure decay modes:
eigenstates with pure, smooth exponential decay, devoid of the oscillatory wave
patterns typical of traditional NHSE. Modeled as directed graphs with
non-reciprocal hopping, these systems reveal quantized decay charges, defined
as the sum of decay constants along edges at each node, offering a novel
topological invariant. We derive universal conditions for these modes, enabling
versatile configurations from one-dimensional rings, directed graphs with
complicated connectivity, to higher-dimensional lattices. Experimental
validation using microwave resonant circuits confirms the predicted pure decay
profiles. This discovery paves the way for potential applications in photonics,

Abstract: Efficient entanglement strategies are essential for advancing variational
quantum circuits (VQCs) for quantum machine learning (QML). However, most
current approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to
task requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce
a novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically
generates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of
constructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies
that boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond
classical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary
matrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable
exploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using
entanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define
unconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per
qubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and
evaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified
64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently
outperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing
configurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical
model (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,
nearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the
classical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered
up to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and
generalizability of the identified constructive entanglements.

Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum circuits play a vital role in the
development of quantum computers and for taking the temperature of the field.
Here, we classically simulate various physically-motivated circuits using 2D
tensor network ans\"atze for the many-body wavefunction which match the
geometry of the underlying quantum processor. We then employ a generalized
version of the boundary Matrix Product State contraction algorithm to
controllably generate samples from the resultant tensor network states. Our
approach allows us to systematically converge both the quality of the final
state and the samples drawn from it to the true distribution defined by the
circuit. With these methods, we simulate the largest local unitary Jastrow
ansatz circuit taken from recent IBM experiments to numerical precision. We
also study a domain-wall quench in a two-dimensional discrete-time Heisenberg
model on large heavy-hex and rotated square lattices, which reflect IBM's and
Google's latest quantum processors respectively. We observe a rapid buildup of
complex loop correlations on the Google Willow geometry which significantly
impact the local properties of the system. Meanwhile, we find loop correlations
build up extremely slowly on heavy-hex processors and have almost negligible
impact on the local properties of the system, even at large circuit depths. Our
results underscore the role the geometry of the quantum processor plays in
classical simulability.

Abstract: Graph states represent a significant class of multi-partite entangled quantum
states with applications in quantum error correction, quantum communication,
and quantum computation. In this work, we introduce a novel formalism called
the Entanglement Matrix for quantifying and classifying entanglement in n-qubit
graph states. Leveraging concepts from graph theory and quantum information, we
develop a systematic approach to analyze entanglement by identifying primary
and secondary midpoints in graph representations, where midpoints correspond to
controlled-Z gate operations between qubits. Using Von Neumann entropy as our
measure, we derive precise mathematical relationships for maximum entanglement
in graph states as a function of qubit number. Our analysis reveals that
entanglement follows a quadratic relationship with the number of qubits, but
with distinct behaviors for odd versus even qubit systems. For odd n-qubit
graph states, maximum entanglement follows $E_{\max} = n^2 - n$, while even
n-qubit states exhibit higher entanglement with varying formulae depending on
specific configurations. Notably, systems with qubit counts that are multiples
of 12 demonstrate enhanced entanglement properties. This comprehensive
classification framework provides valuable insights into the structure of
multi-qubit entanglement, establishing an analytical foundation for
understanding entanglement distribution in complex quantum systems that may
inform future quantum technologies.

Motivation: 传统解码器在高错误率场景下效率低，需要开发更高效的局部解码器以减少量子计算中的I/O带宽限制。

Method: 基于Clique解码器，Clique_L2放宽了原始约束并增加低成本逻辑，以处理长度-2错误链。

Result: 在数据量子位错误和均匀随机噪声下，Clique_L2比Clique_L1减少8.95x解码带宽；在集群错误下减少18.3x。

Conclusion: Clique_L2显著提升了量子纠错的效率和适应性，适用于更广泛的物理量子位错误率范围。

Abstract: The growing demand for fault-tolerant quantum computing drives the need for
efficient, scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) strategies. Conventional
decoders designed for worst-case error scenarios incur significant overhead,
prompting the development of local decoders, that leverage the sparse and often
trivial nature of many quantum errors, to support the conventional decoders.
The previously proposed Clique decoder addresses this by handling isolated,
length-1 space and time errors within the cryogenic environment with minimal
hardware costs, thereby mitigating I/O bandwidth constraints between cryogenic
quantum systems and room-temperature processors. Building on this foundation,
we propose Clique_L2 that extends the Clique-based approach by relaxing some
original constraints and incorporating additional low-cost logic to also
correct length-2 error chains in space, which become non-trivial occurrences at
higher physical error rates and code distances. This enhanced capability not
only further reduces out-of-the-fridge data transmission but also adapts more
effectively to clustered errors observed under a variety of noise models.
Specifically, under data-qubit-only errors and uniformly random noise,
Clique_L2 achieves up to 8.95x decoding bandwidth reduction over the original
Clique (or Clique_L1) decoder, especially beneficial at higher code distances.
When clustered errors and longer error chains are more likely to occur,
Clique_L2 achieves up to 18.3x decoding bandwidth reduction over Clique_L1,
achieving substantial benefits across a wide range of physical qubit error

Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to
its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals
structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence
properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its
control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin
dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$
relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$
center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which
necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects
of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework,
this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B =
90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic
field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation
is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop
processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study
establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in
$V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments
in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.

Motivation: 研究量子准循环低密度奇偶校验码在联合置信传播解码下的错误率行为，尤其是错误平台的成因。

Method: 使用联合置信传播（BP）解码量子准循环低密度奇偶校验码，并分析其错误率曲线和错误平台现象。

Result: 发现错误率曲线陡峭，错误平台主要由涉及少量比特的特定错误事件引起，可能与Tanner图中的陷阱集有关。

Conclusion: 错误平台可能由陷阱集引起，识别并避免这些结构可能进一步降低错误平台。

Abstract: In this study, we report that quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check
codes decoded via joint belief propagation (BP) exhibit steep error-rate
curves, despite the presence of error floors. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first observation of such threshold-like behavior for quantum codes
with non-vanishing coding rate, excluding those decoded with non-binary BP
decoders. Moreover, we find that dominant error events contributing to the
error floor typically involve only a small number of bits. These findings
suggest that the error floor is caused by trapping sets -- specific subgraph
structures in the Tanner graph -- and indicate that identifying and avoiding
such structures may lead to further reduction of the error floor.

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对碎裂普适类的理解，并具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We investigate the fragmentation of ring-like brittle structures under
explosive loading using a discrete element model. By systematically varying
ring thickness and strain rate, we uncover a transition from one-dimensional
(1D) segmentation to two-dimensional (2D) planar fragmentation and, ultimately,
to complete shattering. This transition is driven by the effective
dimensionality of the crack pattern, which evolves with increasing strain rate.
We identify a critical ring thickness beyond which segmentation ceases, and
fragmentation directly follows a power-law mass distribution characteristic of
2D systems. In the crossover regime, spanning and non-spanning fragments
coexist, enabling control over the power-law exponent of the mass distribution.
At very high strain rates, we observe a transition to complete shattering,
where the system follows a novel scaling law relating the shattering strain
rate to ring thickness. Our results provide fundamental insights into
fragmentation universality classes and offer potential applications in space
debris prediction, controlled detonation technologies, and materials
engineering.

Conclusion: 多临界点在弱无序下保持零能模式，强无序下出现非平庸无间隙安德森局域相。

Abstract: Recently, the intriguing interplay between topology and quantum criticality
has been unveiled in one-dimensional topological chains with extended
nearest-neighbor couplings. In these systems, topologically distinct critical
phases emerge with localized edge modes despite the vanishing bulk gap. In this
work, we study the topological multicritical points at which distinct gapped
and critical phases intersect. Specifically, we consider a topological chain
with coupling up to the third nearest neighbors, which shows stable localized
edge modes at the multicritical points. These points possess only nontrivial
gapped and critical phases around them and are also characterized by the
quadratic dispersion around the gap-closing points. We characterize the
topological multicritical points in terms of the topological invariant obtained
from the zeros of the complex function associated with the Hamiltonian.
Further, we analyze the nature of zeros in the vicinity of the multicritical
points by calculating the discriminants of the associated polynomial. The
discriminant uniquely identifies the topological multicritical points and
distinguishes them from the trivial ones. We finally study the robustness of
the zero-energy modes at the multicritical points at weak disorder strengths,
and reveal the presence of a topologically nontrivial gapless
Anderson-localized phase at strong disorder strengths.

Abstract: We investigate the localization transition of interacting particles in a
one-dimensional correlated disorder system. The disorder which we investigate
allows for vanishing backwards scattering processes. We derive by two
renormalization group procedures its phase diagram and predict that the
localization transition point is shifted from finite attractive interaction to
the non-interacting point. We finally show numerically that the scaling of the
localization length with the disorder strength deviates from the usual scaling
of a localized phase.

TL;DR: 论文研究了三维孤子Hopfion的构造与稳定性，通过Gross-Pitaevskii方程在双原子气体中的Bose-Einstein凝聚态中实现，分析了其拓扑电荷与稳定性条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Hopfion作为三维孤子的特性和稳定性，特别是在Bose-Einstein凝聚态中的实现及其拓扑性质。

Method: 使用Gross-Pitaevskii方程（GPE）系统，结合立方自吸引和四次自排斥的Lee-Huang-Yang（LHY）项，以及环形势阱（TP），进行数值分析。

Result: 发现S=1,M=0的Hopfion在TP内半径超过临界值时稳定；S=1,M=1~7的Hopfion部分稳定，且LHY超流体中完全稳定。

Conclusion: Hopfion的稳定性依赖于LHY项的存在，其拓扑结构可通过几何图像直观展示，Q_H值决定了其交叉点的数量与花瓣结构。

Abstract: Hopfions are a class of three-dimensional (3D) solitons which are built as
vortex tori carrying intrinsic twist of the toroidal core. They are
characterized by two independent topological charges, \textit{viz}., vorticity
$S$ and winding number $M$ of the intrinsic twist, whose product determines the
\textit{Hopf number}, $Q_{H}=MS$, which is the basic characteristic of the
hopfions. We construct hopfions as solutions of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii
equations (GPEs) for Bose-Einstein condensates in binary atomic gases. The GPE
system includes the cubic mean-field self-attraction, competing with the
quartic self-repulsive Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, which represents effects of
quantum fluctuations around the mean-field state, and a trapping toroidal
potential (TP). A systematic numerical analysis demonstrates that families of
the states with $S=1,M=0$, i.e., $Q_{H}=0$, are stable, provided that the inner
TP\ radius $R_{0}$ exceeds a critical value. Furthermore, true hopfions with
$S=1,M=1\sim 7$, which correspond, accordingly, to $Q_{H}=1\sim 7$, also form
partly stable families, including the case of the LHY\ superfluid, in which the
nonlinearity is represented solely by the LHY term. On the other hand, the
hopfion family is completely unstable in the absence of the LHY term, when only
the mean-field nonlinearity is present. We illustrate the knot-like structure
of the hopfions by means of an elementary geometric picture. For $Q_{H}=0$,
circles which represent the \textit{preimage} of the full state do not
intersect. On the contrary, for $Q_{H}\geq 1$ they intersect at points whose
number is identical to $Q_{H}$. The intersecting curves form multi-petal
structures with the number of petals also equal to $Q_{H}$.

Motivation: 研究量子液滴在约束条件下的稳定性，以理解其表面张力和液体行为。

Method: 通过Bogoliubov-deGennes方程和Gross-Pitaevskii模拟，分析横向谐波约束对不稳定性的影响。

Result: 增加约束可逐步抑制不稳定性，超过临界陷阱频率后完全稳定。

Conclusion: 横向约束是调控量子液滴稳定性的有效手段。

Abstract: Quantum Bose-Bose mixtures with strong attraction can form self-bound,
liquid-like droplets stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Despite equilibrium
densities much lower than those of classical liquids, these droplets exhibit
finite surface tension and liquid-like behaviors. Recent experiments have
demonstrated Rayleigh-Plateau instability in elongated droplets confined in an
optical waveguide. Here we consider the case of an infinite filament and extend
the theoretical description to include transverse harmonic confinement. By
solving the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations within a single-component framework,
benchmarked against full Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we show that increasing
confinement progressively suppresses the instability, leading to complete
stabilization beyond a critical trap frequency.

Abstract: Optical lattice clocks have set records in clock precision and accuracy.
Continuing to advance their performance, via probing as many atoms for the
longest interrogation time affordable, requires experimentally and
theoretically studying a many-body lattice system. Motivated by recent
experimental results on a Fermi-degenerate three-dimensional optical lattice
clock, we present a theoretical overview of Ramsey and Rabi spectroscopy in
one-dimensional chains. At realistic experimental temperatures and confinement
conditions, atoms are spatially localized into small chains of $\approx 1-5$
atoms. We show that in the presence of spin-orbit coupling induced by the clock
laser, the spectroscopy observables are modified by superexchange interactions
within each chain, and depend strongly on the length of the chain. The thermal
distribution of chain lengths thus plays a key role in the spectroscopy
measurements. Our results offer insight into observable many-body effects in
state-of-the-art lattice clocks and suggest new directions for optimizing clock
performance.

Result: 通过二维混沌映射（如二维帐篷映射和Arnold猫映射）的多个可观测量的应用，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了大偏差框架，为多维混沌系统中罕见事件的研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Due to the deterministic nature of chaotic systems, fluctuations in their
trajectories arise solely from the choice of initial conditions. Some of these
dynamical fluctuations may lead to extremely unlikely scenarios. Understanding
the impact of such rare events and the trajectories that give rise to them is
of significant interest across disciplines. Yet, identifying the initial
conditions responsible for those events is a challenging task due to the
inherent sensitivity to small perturbations of chaotic dynamics. In a recent
paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 227201 (2023)], this challenge was addressed by
finding the effective dynamics that make rare events typical for
one-dimensional chaotic maps. Here we extend such large-deviation framework to
$d$-dimensional chaotic maps. Specifically, for any such map, we propose a
method to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the
rare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability
of this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of
two-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat
map.

Result: 修订后的TCP与原始TCP及Onsager定理在结论上相似。

Conclusion: 修订后的TCP理论框架在基础上更严谨，但仍保持与原始理论和经典理论的一致性。

Abstract: Recently, the present author proposed a Theory of Cross Phenomena (TCP),
which asserts that the flux of a molar quantity is governed solely by the
gradient of its conjugate potential, as derived from the combined law of
thermodynamics. This contrasts with the classical Onsager theorem, i.e., flux
equations and reciprocal relations, which posit that fluxes are linearly
related to the gradients of all potentials through a symmetric kinetic
coefficient matrix. In the present work, the original TCP is revised with the
flux equation derived from the first law of thermodynamics and the definitions
of the total entropy change and the total work change of an internal process.
Although the revision is foundational, both original and revised TCP frameworks
lead to similar conclusions with respect to the Onsager theorem.

Conclusion: 模型展示了微观可逆性与宏观熵产生的共存，为教学提供了丰富案例。

Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a
two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners to explore
chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats
in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By
integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the
complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space
contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate,
interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat
anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto
-\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory. The approximate
Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as |Tx -
Ty| increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under
strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly
time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic
reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.

Abstract: The notion of Markov duality between two Markov processes that can live in
two different configurations spaces $(x,{\tilde x})$ is revisited via the
spectral decompositions of the two Markov generators in their bi-orthogonal
basis of right and left eigenvectors. In this formulation, the two generators
should have the same eigenvalues $(-E)$ that may be complex, while the duality
function $\Omega(x,{\tilde x})$ can be considered as a mapping between the
right and the left eigenvectors of the two models. We describe how this
spectral perspective is useful to better understand two well-known dualities
between processes defined in the same configuration space: the Time-Reversal
duality corresponds to an exchange between the right and the left eigenvectors
that involves the steady state, while in the Siegmund duality, the left
eigenvectors correspond to integrals of the dual right eigenvectors. We then
focus on the famous Moment-Duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion on the
interval $x \in [0,1] $ and the Kingman Markov jump process on the
semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$ in order to analyze the relations
between their eigenvectors living in two different configuration spaces.
Finally, we discuss how the spectral perspective can be used to construct new
dualities and we give an example for the case of non-degenerate real
eigenvalues, where one can always construct a dual Directed Jump process on the
semi-infinite lattice $n \in {\mathbb N}$, whose transitions rates are the
opposite-eigenvalues.

Abstract: The Kosterlitz-Thouless and the Hexatic phase transitions are celebrated
examples of dipole (vortex, dislocation) induced transitions in condensed
matter physics. For very clear reasons, these important ``topological"
transitions are restricted to 2-dimensions. Here we present a genuine
dipole-induced transition in the 3-dimensional response of (athermal) amorphous
solids to applied strain. Similarly to the existence of a hexatic phase between
normal solid and fluid, we identify an intermediate phase between a phase of
normal elastic response at high pressure, and fluid matter at zero pressure.
The mechanical response in the intermediate phase is accompanied by plasticity
that is generically associated with ``non-affine" quadrupolar events seen in
the resulting displacement field. Gradients of the quadrupolar fields act as
dipole charges that screen elasticity, breaking both translational and Chiral
symmetries. We highlight {\em angular} correlations that exhibit diverging
correlation lengths at this transition and determine the critical scaling
exponents.

Abstract: We study first-passage statistics for one-dimensional random walks $S_n$ with
independent and identically distributed jumps starting from the origin. We
focus on the joint distribution of the first-passage time $\tau_b$ and
first-passage position $S_{\tau_b}$ beyond a threshold $b\geq0$, as well as the
distribution of $S_n$ for the walks that do not cross $b$ up to step $n$. By
solving suitable Riemann-Hilbert problems, we are able to obtain exact and
semi-explicit general formulae for the quantities of interest. Notably, such
formulae are written solely in terms of the characteristic function of the
jumps. In contrast with previous results, our approach is universally valid,
applicable to both continuous and discrete, symmetric and asymmetric jump
distributions. We complement our theoretical findings with explicit examples.

Abstract: Recent works proved a hydrodynamic limit for periodically forced atom chains
with harmonic interaction and pinning, together with momentum flip. When energy
is the only conserved quantity, one would expect similar results in the
anharmonic case, as conjectured for the temperature profile and energy flux.
However, outside the harmonic case, explicit computations are generally no
longer possible, thus making a rigorous proof of this hydrodynamic limit
difficult. Consequently, we numerically investigate the plausibility of this
limit for the particular case of a chain with $\beta$-FPUT interactions and
harmonic pinning. We present our simulation results suggesting that the
conjectured PDE for the limiting temperature profile and Green--Kubo type
formula for the limiting energy current conjectured are correct. We then use
this Green--Kubo type formula to investigate the relationship between the
energy current and period of the forcing. This relationship is investigated in
the case of significant rate of momentum flip, small rate of momentum flip and
no momentum flip. We compare the relationship observed in the anharmonic case
to that of the harmonic case for which explicit formulae are available.

Abstract: Dimension in physical systems determines universal properties at criticality.
Yet, the impact of structural perturbations on dimensionality remains largely
unexplored. Here, we characterize the attraction basins of structural fixed
points in scale-invariant networks from a renormalization group perspective,
demonstrating that basin stability connects to a structural phase transition.
This topology-dependent effect, which we term geometric criticality, triggers a
geometric breakdown hereto unknown, which induces non-trivial fractal
dimensions and unveils hidden flows toward unstable structural fixed points.
Our systematic study of how networks and lattices respond to disorder paves the
way for future analysis of non-ergodic behavior induced by quenched disorder.

Result: 识别了多个关键时间尺度，发现非平衡动力学与平衡极限的显著偏差，且势垒高度影响时间尺度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了足够长时间对构建势能景观的重要性，并对有限时间内的激活过程控制提供了启示。

Abstract: Kramers' rate theory forms a cornerstone for thermally activated barrier
crossing. However, its reliance on equilibrium quantities excludes analysis of
nonequilibrium dynamics at early times. Most works have thus focused on
obtaining rates and transition time and path distributions in equilibrium.
Instead, here we consider early-time nonequilibrium dynamics in a model system
of a particle with overdamped dynamics hopping over the barrier in a
double-well potential, using the Smoluchowski equation (SE) and stochastic path
integral (SPI) mapping of the Langevin equation. We identify several key
timescales relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics and quantify them using the SE
and SPI approaches. The shortest timescale corresponds to equilibration in a
well at time $t \ll \tau_{\rm B}$, where $\tau_{\rm B}$ is the Brownian
diffusion time. The second important timescale is when an inflexion point
appears in the effective potential constructed from the density at $t
\lessapprox \tau_{\rm B}$. Shortly after, the existence of a second potential
well can be inferred from sufficient sampling of the dynamics. Interestingly,
this timescale decreases with increasing barrier height. We find significant
deviations from the equilibrium limit unless $t \gg \tau_{\rm B}$. We further
calculate \red{the} density current at the barrier for bistable and asymmetric
potentials and find that it crosses over to that from equilibrium rate theory
at a time that does not appear to depend on the barrier height. Our results
have important implications for controlling activated processes at finite times
and demonstrate the importance of reaching long enough times to faithfully
construct potential landscapes from experimental or simulation data.

Conclusion: 两种工具的结合为理解A3NNI伊辛链的相行为提供了新视角，尤其是挫败效应和调制序的机制。

Abstract: In this work we revisit the Axial Third Nearest Neighbour Ising (A3NNI) chain
and examine in detail some aspects of its phase behaviour ensuing from
competing interactions and resulting frustration. We probe the phase behaviour
with two complimentary tools: a microscopic two-point correlation function
$\mathcal{C}(n)$ which we carefully construct after appropriate spin
transformations, and a macroscopic, thermodynamic curvature $R$ which we obtain
from the free entropy. We report novel observations of phenomena such as
hyperscaling breakdown and intermediate-ranged modulations among others. The
zero field thermodynamic curvature $R_0$ is shown to systematically sub-divide
the ground state phases into regions of attractive or repulsive effective
interactions of varying strength. Furthermore, $R_0$ brings forth the
significance of some third order moments in describing the effects of
frustration, including the multiphase lines. Combined use of both the probes in
the short-ranged modulated order regime confirms and further clarifies the
discussion in [1] regarding the appropriate measure of high temperature
correlation length in this regime.

Result: 三重-q态与实验观测一致，而共线锯齿态与铁磁行为不兼容。

Conclusion: 非共线多-q态是解释铁磁行为的合理基态，对其他Kitaev材料有启示意义。

Abstract: Ferrimagnetism appears in the temperature-field phase diagrams of several
candidate Kitaev materials, such as the honeycomb cobaltates
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ and Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$. In a number of instances, however,
the exact nature of the corresponding ground states remains the subject of
ongoing debate. We show that general symmetry considerations can rule out
candidate states that are incompatible with the observed ferrimagnetic
behavior. In particular, we demonstrate that a ferrimagnetic response cannot be
reconciled with a collinear zigzag ground state, owing to the combined
time-reversal and translational symmetry inherent to that configuration.
Instead, the observed behavior is fully compatible with the symmetries of
noncollinear multi-$\mathbf q$ states, such as the triple-$\mathbf q$ discussed
in the context of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. We exemplify this general result by
computing the ferrimagnetic response of an extended Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma
model with explicit sublattice symmetry breaking within linear spin-wave
theory. If the model realizes a triple-$\mathbf q$ ground state, the calculated
magnetization curve is well consistent with the low-temperature behavior
observed in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. In this case, a finite magnetization remains
in the zero-temperature limit as a consequence of quantum fluctuations, even if
the $g$-factors on the different sublattices are identical. For a zigzag ground
state, by contrast, the total magnetization vanishes both at zero and finite
temperatures, independent of possible sublattice-dependent $g$-factors, as
expected from the symmetry analysis. The implications of our general result for
other Kitaev materials exhibiting ferrimagnetic behavior are also briefly
discussed.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between electronic correlations and band topology
remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics, primarily hindered by
a language mismatch problem. While band topology is naturally formulated within
a single-particle band theory, strong correlations typically elude such an
effective one-body description. In this work, we bridge this gap leveraging the
ghost Gutzwiller (gGut) variational embedding framework, which introduces
auxiliary quasiparticle degrees of freedom to recover an effective band
structure description of strongly correlated systems. This approach enables an
interpretable and computationally efficient treatment of correlated topological
phases, resulting in energy- and momentum-resolved topological features that
are directly comparable with experimental spectra. We exemplify the advantages
of this framework through a detailed study of the interacting
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. Not only does the gGut description reproduce
established results, but it also reveals previously inaccessible aspects: most
notably, the emergence of topologically nontrivial Hubbard bands hosting their
own edge states, as well as possible ways to manipulate these through a finite
magnetization. These results position the gGut framework as a promising tool
for the predictive modeling of correlated topological materials.

Conclusion: 自然超轨道框架为压缩算子表示提供了新途径，有望用于大规模系统的长时间尺度计算。

Abstract: We introduce the concept of natural super-orbitals for many-body operators,
defined as the eigenvectors of the one-body super-density matrix associated
with a vectorized operator. We first analyze the general analytical properties
of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of
non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a
numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the
time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two
many-body systems: the fermionic $t\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model,
using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the $t\text{-}V$
model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity model, the
occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay exponentially at
all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute
significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact
matrix-product-operator representation in the natural orbital basis. Finally,
we examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local
operators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator
in the natural orbital basis saturates over time. This new framework opens the
door to future research that leverages the compressed structure of operators in
their natural super-orbital basis, enabling for instance the computation of
out-of-time-order correlators in large interacting systems over extended time
scales.

Abstract: Developing accurate numerical methods for strongly interacting fermions is
crucial for improving our understanding of various quantum many-body phenomena,
especially unconventional superconductivity. Recently, neural quantum states
have emerged as a promising approach for studying correlated fermions,
highlighted by the hidden fermion and backflow methods, which use neural
networks to model corrections to fermionic quasiparticle orbitals. In this
work, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that
naturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion
Pfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and
superconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic
complexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art
variational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive
Hubbard models. We show that the HFPS is able to capture both s-wave and d-wave
pairing, and therefore may be a useful tool for modeling phases with
unconventional superconductivity.

Abstract: We propose a mixed-configuration approximation based on single-band impurity
solvers to efficiently study nonequilibrium multi-orbital systems at moderate
computational cost. In this work, we merge the approach with the so-called
auxiliary master equation approach. As benchmark, we first show that our
approach reproduces the results of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for two-orbital
impurity models at equilibrium with overall good accuracy, especially for
non-degenerate orbitals. We then use our approach as impurity solver for
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to address the case of a two-orbital,
realistic layered structure, recovering the strong crystal-field-driven charge
polarization observed by solving the DMFT self-consistent cycle with QMC,
albeit slightly reduced. Finally, we address a prototype nonequilibrium setup
by sandwiching this layer between metallic contacts subject to a bias voltage
described by different chemical potentials. This simplified model demonstrates
out method's potential to access nonequilibrium steady-state behavior of
multi-orbital, realistic materials. These findings provide a first-step basis
for theoretical studies of nonequilibrium properties of multi-orbital compounds
directly in the real frequency domain.

Conclusion: U2Rh2Sb是一种中间价态候选材料，实验结果与理论分析一致，为锕系中间价态研究提供了新案例。

Abstract: Intermediate-valence behavior is sometimes observed in lanthanide-based
materials containing Ce, Yb, Sm or Eu. However, the number of actinide-based
systems that exhibit this type of behavior is rather limited. In this work, we
present the discovery and characterization of a uranium compound U2Rh2Sb, which
turns out to be a candidate for the intermediate-valencebehavior. The material
shows a characteristic feature in the magnetic susceptibility around T = 50 K,
which can be described within the interconfiguration-fluctuation model of
intermediate valence systems. We find the energy difference between the
5f3(U3+) and 5f2(U4+) states to be $\delta$Eex/kB $\approx$ 400 K and the
corresponding valence fluctuation temperature to be Tvf $\approx$ 140 K. The
value of the electronic specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ = 50 mJ mol-1 U K-2
signals a modest electron effective mass enhancement. The electrical
resistivity indicates metallic behavior, albeit with a small residual
resistivity ratio. Measurements of thermoelectric properties indicate a change
of sign in the Seebeck coefficient around T = 100 K, with a minimum achieved at
T = 50 K, which coincides with the broad peak observed in magnetic
susceptibility. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical
analysis, based on the first-principles calculations, including lattice
dynamics.

Conclusion: 锕系氧化物中5f态的性质受晶体场和杂化作用的共同影响，U(VI)和U(V)的化学键共价性较高。

Abstract: The $5f$ states were probed in ThO$_2$ and U(VI) and U(V) oxides using x-ray
absorption spectroscopy at the actinide $O_{4,5}$ edges. Measured data were
analyzed by several approaches including atomic, crystal-field theory and the
Anderson impurity model to take into account the hybridization of actinide
valence states with oxygen $2p$ states. For Th(IV), the $5f$ states are mainly
affected by the crystal-field interaction with the closest neighbors as can be
seen from the corresponding spectrum of ThO$_2$. In turn, for U(VI) and U(V)
oxides, the U $5f$-O $2p$ hybridization and high degree of covalency in the
chemical bonding play a decisive role increasing the $5f$ occupancy and
consequently governing the ground and excited state properties. That is
additionally illustrated by results from the calculations of the U $5d$ x-ray
photoemission spectra for U(V) in the lattice of La-doped UO$_2$.

perspective unifies existing methods such as stochastic reconfiguration and
Rayleigh-Gauss-Newton, provides connections to classic function-space
algorithms, and motivates the derivation of novel algorithms with geometrically
principled hyperparameter choices. We validate our framework with numerical
experiments demonstrating its practical relevance through the accurate
estimation of ground-state energies for several prototypical models in
condensed matter physics modeled with neural network wavefunctions.

Abstract: Bilayer nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity under proper
hydrostatic pressure or epitaxial strain, signifying the emergence of quantum
phase transitions whose physical mechanisms remain unclear. Using a minimal
bilayer Hubbard model incorporating only the essential Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$
orbitals, we demonstrate that a phase transition naturally arises from tuning
the ratio of intralayer to interlayer hopping amplitudes. The transition point
separates regimes with a rich interplay between superconducting and
density-wave orders. In the regime with weaker intralayer hopping,
quasi-long-range spin-density-wave and pair-density-wave orders coexist, with
the former being dominant. Across the transition, the spin-density-wave order
becomes short-ranged, accompanied by the emergence of the quasi-long-range
charge-density-wave order. Most significantly, superconductivity is
dramatically enhanced in this regime, though it no longer exhibits the
pair-density-wave signature. This quantum phase transition, driven by the
competition between intralayer and interlayer hopping, provides a plausible
microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed correlation between the
superconducting transition temperature and ratio of out-of-plane to in-plane
lattice constants. Our findings may assist future efforts in optimizing
experimental conditions to further enhance superconductivity in bilayer
nickelates.

Abstract: The honeycomb magnet Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ recently emerged as a promising
candidate for realizing Kitaev quantum spin liquid with relatively low levels
of structural disorder. While the precise spin Hamiltonian remains
controversial, the potential existence of a quantum spin liquid or other novel
quantum magnetic phases continues to stimulate investigation. Here, we study
the temperature and magnetic field-dependent spin excitations of
Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ on a twin-free single crystal using magneto-terahertz (THz)
spectroscopy, focusing on magnetic anisotropy and field-induced unusual phases.
We observe a low-energy continuum excitation above $T_N$ and a 0.5 THz (2 meV)
spin wave excitation in magnetic order under zero field. Upon applying an
in-plane magnetic field, the spin waves transform to a magnetic continuum over
an intermediate field range, above which the system enters a spin-polarized
state. Crucially, the spin excitation spectra reveal striking anisotropy
between the $\textbf{a}$ and $\textbf{b}$ crystallographic axes, demanding
description by a strongly anisotropic spin model. These findings establish
Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ as a model system for investigating field-tunable quantum
magnetism and potential spin liquid behavior in highly anisotropic systems.

Conclusion: 交替磁体的基态能量对交替磁性相互作用不敏感，且量子波动效应符合Goldstone定理的预期。

Abstract: The magnetic properties of two-dimensional altermagnets can be obtained from
a square lattice Heisenberg model with antiferromagetic nearest neighbor
interaction and two types of next-nearest neighbor interactions arranged in a
checkerboard pattern. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory we calculate for this
model the corrections to the renormalized magnon spectrum and the staggered
magnetization to first order in the inverse spin quantum number $1/S$. We also
show that to order $1/S^2$ the ground state energy is not sensitive to the
component of the interaction which is responsible for altermagnetism. At the
$\Gamma$-point the $1/S$-correction to the magnon dispersion vanishes so that
quantum fluctuations do not induce a gap in the magnon spectrum of
altermagnets, as expected by Goldstone's theorem. We extract the leading
$1/S$-corrections to the spin-wave velocity and the effective mass
characterizing the curvature of the magnon dispersion in altermagnets.

quantics tensor train diagnostics approach allows us to i) identify quantum
phase transitions (ground state crossings) and thermal crossovers, ii)
distinguish between these two by allowing flexibility through iii) using
arbitrary available correlators and iv) the possibility to deal with
low-accuracy input data through varying the quantics tensor train cutoffs. We
verify the validity of the approach by studying the phase diagram of the
Hubbard dimer, the four-site Hubbard ring with and without next-nearest
neighbor hopping and the single-impurity Anderson model. We find time scale
entanglement to be a system-inherent property becoming maximal at phase
transitions and crossover, which translates to peaks in the quantics tensor
train bond dimension of correlator functions. Additionally, the connection of
the method to other physical quantities, such as various entanglement measures
and susceptibilities, is shown.

Abstract: Specific heat is a powerful probe offering insights into the entropy and
excitation spectrum of the studied material. While it is well established, a
key challenge remains the measurements of microcrystals or thin films
especially in the sub-Kelvin, high magnetic field regime. Here we present a
setup combining the high sensitivity of SiN$_x$ membrane based calorimetry with
the absolute accuracy of Coulomb blockade thermometry to realise a
nanocalorimeter for such tasks. The magnetic field independent technique of
Coulomb blockade thermometry provides an on-platform thermometer combining a
primary thermometry mode for in-situ calibration with a fast secondary mode
suitable for specific heat measurements. The setup is validated using
measurements of a 20 $\mu$g sample of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ achieving a resolution
on the order of 0.1 nJ/K at 500 mK and an absolute accuracy limited by the
determination of the sample's mass. Measurements of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ further
highlight the benefits of measuring microcrystals with such a device.

Abstract: Rare-earth triangular-lattice magnets serve as an excellent platform for
investigating exotic quantum magnetic phenomena. Recently, the hexaaluminate
\cmao\ has been proposed to host a $U(1)$ Dirac quantum spin liquid state with
dominant Ising anisotropy. Here, we report a systematic study of its analogue,
\nzao, employing ac susceptibility, inelastic neutron scattering, and muon spin
relaxation measurements. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements establish a
well-defined $J_\mathrm{eff}$ = 1/2 ground state with moderate Ising anisotropy
($g_c$ = 4.54, $g_\mathrm{ab}$ = 1.42). Muon spin relaxation measurements
reveal persistent fluctuations emerging below $\sim$15\,K, and extending down
to at least 0.28 K. AC susceptibility data further indicate an absence of
magnetic ordering or spin freezing down to 50\,mK, despite an overall
antiferromagnetic interaction with the Curie-Weiss temprature of $-0.42$\,K.
These results suggest that \nzao\ is a good candidate material for realizing a
quantum spin liquid state.

Conclusion: 研究为理解Sm基化合物磁序的电子起源提供了光谱学依据，并为4f电子二维磁性材料研究提供了平台。

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials provide a unique platform for
exploring quantum phases from magnetic order in reduced dimensions. While there
have been extensive studies on 2D magnetic materials based on 3$d$ electrons,
experimental studies on 4$f$-electron counterparts are far fewer, particularly
on their electronic structure. In this study, we report the successful
synthesis of ultrathin ${\mathrm{SmC}}_{6}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy.
Utilizing in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we uncover
a large band splitting in the valence bands, which we attribute to the
ferromagnetic order driven by exchange couplings between Sm 4$f$ moments and
conduction electrons. Despite the small magnetic moment of Sm, the observed
splitting is comparable to those of Eu- and Gd-based systems with much larger
local moments. Interestingly, the surface state also exhibits splitting with
similar magnitude and can be eliminated by overannealing, while the valence
bands with ferromagnetic-like splittings remain robust. Our work provides
spectroscopic insight to understand the electronic origin of magnetic order in
Sm-based compounds. Our study also offers a platform to study 2D magnetic
materials based on 4$f$ electrons.

Result: GdZn$_3$P$_3$在4.5 K以下表现出长程反铁磁序，具有强磁各向异性，间接带隙为0.27 eV，单晶显示金属导电性。

Conclusion: GdZn$_3$P$_3$是研究二维晶格中电荷载流子与磁性耦合的典型案例，尤其在短程键序背景下。

Abstract: We investigate a hexagonal ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type antiferromagnet GdZn$_3$P$_3$
single crystal. Compared with antiferromagnetic topological material
EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M=Zn, Cd; X=P, As), the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ features an additional
ZnP$_3$ trigonal planar units. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction
analysis reveals that Zn and P atoms within trigonal planar layer exhibit
significant anisotropic displacement parameters with a space group of P63/mmc.
Meanwhile, scanning transmission electron microscopy experiment demonstrates
the presence of interstitial P atoms above and below the ZnP honeycomb lattice,
suggesting potential ZnP bond instability within the ZnP$_3$ trigonal layers.
Concerning the triangular Gd$^{3+}$ layer, the magnetic susceptibility
$\chi$$(T)$ and heat capacity measurements reveal long-range antiferromagnetic
order at T$_N$ = 4.5 K. Below T$_N$, the in-plane $\chi$$(T)$ is nearly 4 times
the $\chi$$(T)$ along $c$ axis, indicative of strong magnetic anisotropy. The
Curie Weiss fitting to the low temperature $\chi$$(T)$ data reveals
ferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = 5.2 K) in ab-plane, and
antiferromagnetic interaction ($\theta$$_{CW}$ = -1 K) along c axis, suggesting
the ground state as an A-type antiferromagnetic order. Correspondingly, the
density function theory calculation shows that GdZn$_3$P$_3$ is an indirect
semiconductor with a band gap 0.27 eV, supported by the resistivity measurement
on polycrystal sample. Interestingly, the GdZn$_3$P$_3$ single crystal exhibits
metallic conductivity with an anomaly at T$_N$, likely associated with the
observation of interstitial P atoms mentioned above. Therefore, our results
establish GdZn$_3$P$_3$ system as a concrete example for investigating the
coupling between charge carrier and triangular lattice magnetism in the
two-dimensional lattice framework, on the background of short-range bond order.

Conclusion: TTG是研究量子相位涨落、库珀对局域化和非常规超导性的可调平台，且显著违反Pauli极限。

Abstract: When dimensionality is reduced, enhanced quantum fluctuations can destroy
long-range phase coherence, driving a superconductor insulator transition, SIT,
where disorder and electronic correlations give rise to novel many-body states.
Here, we report the first observation of a magnetic field tuned SIT in
mirrorsymmetric twisted trilayer graphene, TTG. Remarkably, signatures of
quantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic
fields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a
regime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a
globally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by
an infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation
dynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal
strongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant
transition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct
evidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are
able to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical
point, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced
quantum dynamics. Our results further show that TTG strongly violates the Pauli
limit and establishes twisted trilayer graphene as a tunable platform for
exploring quantum phase fluctuations, Cooper pair localization, and
unconventional superconductivity.

Abstract: We study electron transport in monolayer molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$
subjected to a magnetic barrier. Our analysis employs a full-band continuum
model to capture the relevant physical phenomena. We focus on how electron
energy, magnetic field strength, and the geometric characteristics of the
barrier affect the transmission and conductance. We observe sharp resonant
tunneling features emerging from quantum interference effects induced by
magnetic confinement. A key outcome of our study is the discovery of distinct
resonance patterns in the conduction and valence bands. These patterns are
closely related to the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in MoS$_2$ and the
breaking of time-reversal symmetry by the magnetic field. This results in
significant spin and valley selectivity in electron transport. We demonstrate
that adjusting external parameters precisely controls spin-polarized and
valley-polarized currents. We show that a magnetic barrier can control electron
spin and valley in MoS$_2$, making it a promising platform for energy-efficient
spintronic and valleytronic devices.

Abstract: Magnetoacoustic systems offer promising platforms for next-generation sensors

map nonlinear magnon scattering processes in FeGaB/LiNbO3 magnetoacoustic
devices with sub-micron resolution. We observe highly heterogeneous magnetic
noise generation under acoustic driving at 1425 MHz, with responses varying
dramatically across micron length scales. Time-domain measurements reveal
threshold-like nonlinear behavior where NV center spin relaxation rates
increase over two orders of magnitude as drive power is increased. These
findings reveal microscopic noise sources that limit magnetoacoustic sensor
performance while simultaneously demonstrating how acoustic mode engineering
could enable selective control of nonlinear magnon processes.

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently discovered magnetic phase characterized by
spin-split bands without net magnetization, has emerged as promising platform
for novel physics and potential applications. However, its stability against
disorder-ubiquitous in real materials-remains poorly understood. Here, we study
the electron localization properties of two-dimensional altermagnets subject to
disorder. Remarkably, we discover a disorder-driven phase transition from a
marginal metallic phase to an insulator, which falls into the
Kosterlitz-Thouless class. We demonstrate this by convincing numerical evidence
and propose a vortex-antivortex-like spin pair picture for its interpretation.
Moreover, we show that the characteristic spin anisotropy of altermagnets
persists but gradually fades away across the transition. These changes directly
affect the spin-splitting features that are detectable in angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy and tunneling magnetoresistance. Our findings
provide a new perspective on recent experimental observations of altermagnetism
in candidate materials.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on superfluid $^3$He in nanoscale-confined

geometry and perpendicular magnetic field as the size of confinement is varied.
Our analysis is based on minimizing the Ginzburg--Landau free energy for the
$3\times 3$ matrix superfluid order parameter for three different boundary
conditions. We observe a smooth crossover from the phase diagram of the 3D
system to the quasi-2D limit for slab heights of several hundred nanometres and
magnetic fields of several kilogauss. We illuminate that, despite the apparent
complexity of the underlying equations, many precise numerical and even
analytical statements can be made about the phase structure for general values
of the coefficients of the free energy functional, which can in turn be used to
constrain or measure these parameters. To guide future experimental studies, we
compute the phase diagram in dependence of pressure, temperature, slab height,
and magnetic field.

Abstract: In moir\'e crystals, the competition between different isospin configurations
can be tuned by twist angles and stacking orders, forming various
symmetry-broken states. Here we report twisted double
rhombohedral-trilayer-gaphene as a new twisted crystalline flatbands system
showing rich moir\'e dependent topological phenomena. For small twist angles,
programmable Chern insulators with Chern number C = 3 at integer moir\'e
filling v = 1 have been observed. We have further revealed multiple first-order
transitions and an exotic hidden order which can quench the Chern insulator.
Interestingly, for a larger twist angle, multiple Chern insulators with C = 1
at fractional fillings including v = 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 have been observed,
whereas the Chern insulator at v = 1 is absent. Our study demonstrated the
twisted flatbands from rhombohedral-multilayer-graphene as a new platform to

Abstract: Vertically stacked van der Waals structures are promising platforms that
enable layer engineering, opening new avenues for the quantum control of
elementary excitations, including optically generated bound electron-hole
pairs. Here we employ excited-state density functional calculations to
demonstrate strong interlayer excitonic coupling in one-dimensional van der
Waals nanostructures derived from armchair graphene nanoribbons. The excitonic
response exhibits prominent peaks in the near-infrared range, mainly attributed
to intralayer excitons, while interlayer excitations with absorption peak
strengths of up to 13\% of the maximum absorption are also observed. Both
type-I and type-II band alignments are found, which promote the formation of
intralayer and interlayer excitons. Notably, interlayer excitons in these
systems exhibit long-lived radiative lifetimes at room temperature, ranging
from 1 nanosecond to 9.4 microseconds. Our calculations suggest the potential
to tune the excitonic response and lifetimes of bilayer graphene nanoribbons
via careful engineering of the stacking order.

Abstract: We present a detailed and self-contained theoretical study of polarons in

theory of Fr\"ohlich polarons to the 2D case. The theory is fully determined by
experimentally accessible parameters, the static and optical 2D
polarizabilities of a monolayer, the frequency of transverse optical phonons,
and the effective mass of charge carriers. We define a single dimensionless
parameter, which characterizes the coupling of electrons with longitudinal
optical phonons, analyze both weak- and strong-coupling regimes, and adopt the
Feynman variational path-integral approach for a high-quality interpolation
between these limits. Our results provide insight into the ground-state energy

Abstract: Demonstration of a nontrivial result of quasiparticle exchange (or braiding)
is usually considered the definitive proof of a topological phase with
nonabelian excitations, such as Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, in
finite systems with disorder and smooth potential variations, the MBSs are
imperfect in the sense that they are not fully isolated in space and can, to a
varying degree, resemble conventional fermions. Here, we study the braiding
properties of isolated MBSs, regular fermions, and anything in between. We find
a way to compensate for the undesired splitting of the ground-state degeneracy
which occurs during the protocol for imperfect MBS. This leads to a braiding
outcome that depends on the degree of MBS isolation but remains robust and
nonabelian except in the perfect fermion limit. Our protocol could be
implemented in different platforms with nonabelian excitations, including
quantum-dot-based minimal Kitaev chains.

Conclusion: 大尺寸纳米晶体中BX的介电屏蔽效应降低，与强约束纳米晶体行为相反。

Abstract: Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that biexcitons (BX)
confined in large CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals experience reduced dielectric
screening as compared to excitons (X) and trions (X$^*$). Here we provide a
physical rationale to explain such a behavior. A characteristic frequency is
introduced, which describes the internal dynamics of an exciton within the
excitonic complex. By means of effective mass--variational Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, we show that, in large nanocrystals, the frequency is similar for
X and X$^*$, but smaller for BX. Because the frequencies exceed that of the
bulk longitudinal optical phonon, this leads to a reduced dielectric constant
for BX, which is in contrast with the behavior of strongly confined
nanocrystals.

Abstract: Single-photon emitters are essential components for quantum communication
systems, enabling applications such as secure quantum key distribution and the
long-term vision of a quantum internet. Among various candidates,
self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to
their ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their
compatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the
impact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical
properties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure.
The annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength
by promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence
measurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the
single-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of
the emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing
temperature of $760^\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality
of the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with
near transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a
factor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that
rapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that
preserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce
undesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum
photonic applications.

Abstract: A layered ferromagnet Cr$_2$Te$_3$ is attracting growing interest because of
its unique electronic and magnetic properties. Studies have shown that it
exhibits sizable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that changes sign with
temperature. The origin of the AHE and the sign change, however, remains
elusive. Here we show experimentally that electron-magnon scattering
significantly contributes to the AHE in Cr$_2$Te$_3$ through magnon induced
skew scattering, and that the sign change is caused by the competition with the
Berry-curvature or impurity-induced side-jump contribution. The electron-magnon
skew scattering is expected to arise from the exchange interaction between the
itinerant Te $p$-electrons and the localized Cr $d$-electrons modified by the
strong spin-orbit coupling on Te. These results suggest that the magnon-induced
skew scattering can dominate the AHE in layered ferromagnets with heavy
elements.

Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with high Chern number (C) enables
multiple dissipationless edge channels for low-power-consumption electronics.
We report the realization of multiple high-C QAH insulators including C=3,5,6,
and 7 in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. In twist angles of
approximately 1.40{\deg}, we observe QAH effect with C=5 at a filling of one
electron per moir\'e unit cell, persisting up to 2 Kelvin. Furthermore,
incommensurate QAH insulators with C=5,6, and 7 emerge at partial fillings. In
twist angles of 0.89{\deg}, Chern insulators with C=3 and C=6 appear at
fillings of two and three electrons, respectively. Our findings establish
twisted rhombohedral multilayer graphene as a highly tunable platform for
multichannel, dissipationless electronics and for the exploration of exotic
quantum Hall states beyond traditional Landau level paradigm.

Abstract: We demonstrate all-optical generation and detection of high-frequency (up to
~30 GHz) surface acoustic waves (SAWs) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures with
short-period Au gratings on top. We present a sensitive method of SAWs
detection by means of a polarization-sensitive pump-probe technique that
exploits the narrow exciton resonance in high-quality GaAs. The elastic strain
of the SAW causes modulation of the exciton energy in the time domain. As a
result, even a small deformation leads to a noticeable change in the dielectric
function at the detection wavelength leading to an order of magnitude increase
in the detection sensitivity as compared to detection apart from the resonance.
A theoretical model is developed that considers two detection schemes: one
accounting for probe light diffraction and one without.
