The answer to this\nsimple question has important implications for the dynamic properties of the\ncrystal, such as the frequency of its cyclotron motion, and its phonon\nspectrum. In this work we introduce a precise definition of a sliding crystal\nand compute the corresponding current $\\mathbf{j}_c$ for topological electron\ncrystals in the presence of magnetic field. Our result is fully\nnon-perturbative, does not rely on Galilean invariance, and applies equally to\nWigner crystals and (anomalous) Hall crystals. In terms of the electron density\n$\\rho$ and magnetic flux density $\\phi$, we find that $\\mathbf{j}_c =\ne(\\rho-C\\phi)\\mathbf{v}$. Surprisingly, the current receives a contribution\nfrom the many-body Chern number $C$ of the crystal. When $\\rho = C\\phi$,\nsliding crystals therefore carry zero current. The crystalline current fixes\nthe Lorentz force felt by the sliding crystal and the dispersion of low-energy\nphonons of such crystals. This gives us a simple counting rule for the number\nof gapless phonons: if a sliding crystal carries nonzero current in a magnetic\nfield, there is a single gapless mode, while otherwise there are two gapless\nmodes. This result can also be understood from anomaly-matching of emanant\ndiscrete translation symmetries -- an idea that is also applicable to the\ndispersion of skyrmion crystals. Our results lead to novel experimental\nimplications and invite further conceptual developments for electron crystals."}

Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse\nBayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined\nwith amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating\nacceptance probabilities.\\\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum\nBayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead\nalgorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a\nrigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions\nfor the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box\noracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to\nmore accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for\nenvironments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based\nnear-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through\nquantum-enhanced belief updates.\n  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its\nclassical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our\nresults offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage\ntranslates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of\nthe advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings."}

The world is experiencing several of\nthese problems. In this review, a factorization machine with quantum annealing\nor with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA) algorithm to realize fast\ncomputations of BBO using Ising machines (IMs) is discussed. The FMQA algorithm\nuses a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model for BBO. The FM model\ncan be directly transformed into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization\nmodel that can be solved using IMs. This makes it possible to optimize the\nacquisition function in BBO, which is a difficult task using conventional\nmethods without IMs. Consequently, it has the advantage of handling large BBO\nproblems. To be able to perform BBO with the FMQA algorithm immediately, we\nintroduce the FMQA algorithm along with Python packages to run it. In addition,\nwe review examples of applications of the FMQA algorithm in various fields,\nincluding physics, chemistry, materials science, and social sciences. These\nsuccessful examples include binary and integer optimization problems, as well\nas more general optimization problems involving graphs, networks, and strings,\nusing a binary variational autoencoder. We believe that BBO using the FMQA\nalgorithm will become a key technology in IMs including quantum annealers."}

The time-evolution\nof the population imbalance between the two species, as well as the coherence\nof the system are analyzed using a Bloch sphere model. We observe that the\nsystem exhibits relaxation of the Bloch vector components towards a stable\nequilibrium. In the population imbalance dynamics, the relaxation rates\npredicted by the Bogoliubov Born Green Kirkwood Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy are\nfound to be smaller than those calculated with a simple the mean field\napproximation. As for the coherence dynamics, the inclusion of correlations and\nfluctuations in the system can either increase or decrease the relaxation time,\ndepending on the initial conditions. We attribute the increase in the\nrelaxation time to the emergence of a structured noise, and the subsequent\nsuppression of certain dephasing channels. We also study the impact of\ncorrelations and fluctuations on time-averaged quantities like the drift speed,\nthe fringe visibility, the phase entanglement etc., and find the results to be\nin perfect agreement with the properties of the relaxation dynamics."}

In\nantiferromagnets, such pairs can be accessed in the ultrafast regime, where\ncoherent dynamics are dominated by magnons at the edge of the Brillouin zone.\nHowever, it has seemed impossible to generate a net spin current from coherent\nmagnon pairs. Here we show that a coherent superposition of multiple\nmagnon-pair modes can produce such a current in parity-time symmetric\nantiferromagnets. The ultrafast coherent spin currents are excited with\nlinearly polarized light, with the light polarization steering the current\ndirection. Finally, by superposing two orthogonal spin currents, circular spin\ncurrents can be generated, which have not been discussed for steady-state\ncurrents."}
