The ground-state degeneracy and subsystem symmetries are generated\nrecursively layer-by-layer, through the inflation rule, but without a simple,\nuniform pattern. The fracton excitations follow exponential-in-distance and\nalgebraic-in-lattice-size growing patterns when moving outward, and depend\nsensitively to the tessellation geometry, differing qualitatively from both\ntype-I or type-II fracton model on flat lattices. Despite this increased\ncomplexity, the hallmark holographic features -- subregion duality via Rindler\nreconstruction, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for mutual information, and\neffective black hole entropy scaling with horizon area -- remain valid. These\nresults demonstrate that the holographic correspondence in fracton models\npersists in generic tessellations, and provide a natural platform to explore\nmore intricate subsystem symmetries and fracton physics."}

Collectively, we call our decomposition method for\nsymmetrical structures using support qubits the ``step-decreasing structures\nshaped operators (Stesso)\". The main advantage of Stesso is to configurable\nconstruct different decomposed operators of various polarities and intermediate\nsub-circuits, such as Positive Polarity-Stesso, Mixed Polarity-Stesso, and\nGeneralized-Stesso. With Stesso, it has been experimentally proven that\n$(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates always have lower quantum costs than using\nconventional composition methods."}

Charge order in cuprates is characterized by\nshort-range coherence while competing with superconductivity, and as such, it\nprovides a representative case to study the role of phase fluctuation in\ncoupled order parameter dynamics. In this work, we investigated the intertwined\nevolution of charge order and superconductivity in cuprate/manganite\nheterostructures using time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering. The resulting\ndynamics are analyzed within a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model\ncapturing both amplitude and phase dynamics. At low fluence, photo-induced\nsuppression of superconductivity results in a nonthermal enhancement of charge\norder, underscoring the dynamic competition between charge order and\nsuperconductivity. With increasing fluence, the slowing down of melting and\nrecovery dynamics is observed, indicating a critical role of phase\nfluctuations. At high fluence, both charge order and superconductivity remain\nsuppressed for an extended time window due to decoupling between amplitude and\nphase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence.

We verify our proposal through exact\ncalculations on ground states constructed using real space constructions. We\ndemonstrate our method in detail for the groups p4m and p4g, and in the case of\np4m also derive a topological effective action involving gauge fields for\norientation-reversing symmetries. Our results provide a concrete method to\nfully characterize (2+1)D crystalline topological invariants in bosonic SPT\nground states."}

In contrast to the standard situation involving no S-O coupling,\nthe system exhibits long-ranged Casimir forces both in two and three dimensions\n($d=2$ and $d=3$). We identify the relevant scaling variable involving the\nratio $D/\\nu$ of the separation between the confining walls $D$ and the S-O\ncoupling magnitude $\\nu$. We derive and discuss the corresponding scaling\nfunctions for the Casimir energy. In all the considered cases the resulting\nCasimir force is attractive and the S-O coupling $\\nu$ has impact on its\nmagnitude. In $d=3$ the exponent governing the decay of the Casimir force\nbecomes modified by the presence of the S-O coupling, and its value depends on\nthe orientation of the confining walls relative to the plane defined by the\nRashba coupling. In $d=2$ the obtained Casimir force displays singular behavior\nin the limit of vanishing $\\nu$"}

When memory effects induced by\nhidden degrees of freedom are relevant, however, higher-order discrete\nevolution equations are generally required. Focusing on linear dynamics, we\nidentify a well-delineated weak-memory regime where such equations can, on an\nintermediate time scale, be systematically reduced to a unique first-order\ncounterpart acting on the same state space. We formulate our results as a\nmathematical theorem and work out two examples showing how they can be applied\nto stochastic Floquet dynamics under coarse-grained and quantum collisional\nmodels."}

We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron\napproach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing\nchange in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a\nsingle minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For\ntranslational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous\nmagnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes\ndiscontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in\nthe presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum\ndot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the\nscenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker\nfor these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like\nsuperposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the\ntransition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the\neffect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum\ninformation processing."}
