We investigate the non-exponential relaxation behavior of spin\nglasses on network architectures relevant to quantum annealing hardware -- such\nas finite size Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr graphs -- where embedding\nconstraints and finite connectivity strongly modulate the distribution of\nbarriers and metastable states. This slow relaxation arises from the combined\neffects of frustration and disorder, which persist even beyond the conventional\nspin-glass transition. Within the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Coniglio-Klein (FKCK)\ncluster formalism, the appearance of unfrustrated cluster regions gives rise to\nmultiple relaxation scales, as distinct domains follow different dynamical\npathways across a rugged energy landscape. This framework enables a more\ncomprehensive characterization of spin-glass energy landscapes and offers\nvaluable insight into how topological constraints and disorder jointly govern\nrelaxation dynamics, providing quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the\nperformance and limitations of quantum annealing architectures."}

In usual rounds, the weak decoder processes error syndromes and\nsimultaneously evaluates its reliability via soft information.

However, realising electrical spin readout in\nwide-bandgap materials with similar fidelity and bandwidth to optical\napproaches remains challenging. Here, we introduce a photoelectrical spin\nreadout scheme that detects spin information stored long-term as trapped\nelectrical charges. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond as a model\nsystem, spin-dependent photoionisation generates charge carriers that are\nstored in long-lived trap states at a diamond-metal Schottky junction.\nOn-demand illumination of the junction under electrical bias releases stored\ncharge, yielding a photocurrent transient proportional to the amount of trapped\ncharge and hence spin state. Spin readout after coherent control of single NVs\nis demonstrated using charge readout in a protocol we call charge-capture\ndetected magnetic resonance (CCDMR), and we use charge-based imaging to\nidentify charge carrier generation and trapping processes. Our results\nestablish CCDMR as a new technique for solid-state spin qubit readout,\ncombining attaractive features of electrical detection with the stability of\nlong-lived charge traps in wide-bandgap materials."}

Leakage is especially harmful, as it corrupts\nall subsequent syndrome measurements and can spread to neighboring qubits.\nDetecting leakage on data qubits is particularly challenging, since they are\nnever measured directly during QEC cycles. Prior work, such as eraser,\naddresses this by inferring leakage from syndrome patterns using a fixed\nheuristic. However, this approach often misclassifies benign syndromes,\ntriggering excessive leakage-reduction circuits (LRCs). Because LRCs are\nthemselves noisy and slow, these false triggers lengthen QEC cycles and inflate\nlogical error rates.\n  We propose gladiator, a general and adaptable leakage speculation framework\nthat works across surface code, color code, and qLDPC codes. Offline, gladiator\nbuilds a code-aware error-propagation graph calibrated to device data. Online,\nit classifies each syndrome in a few nanoseconds and schedules LRC only when\nthe observed pattern is provably leakage-dominated. This precise speculation\neliminates up to 3x (and on average 2x) unnecessary LRCs, shortens QEC cycles,\nand suppresses false positives at their source. Evaluated on standard\nfault-tolerant benchmarks, gladiator delivers 1.7x-3.9x speedups and 16%\nreduction in logical error rate, advancing the efficiency of fault-tolerant\nquantum computing."}
