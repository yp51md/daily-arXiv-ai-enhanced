In addition, we can\nidentify three distinct depth-dependent regimes, each signaled by a different\nscaling of cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) fidelity over time. In the\nshallow-depth regime, noise effects are perturbatively small; in the\nintermediate regime, circuit-induced fluctuations and noise compete on equal\nfooting; and in the deep-depth regime, the output distribution becomes\neffectively classical, up to corrections that are exponentially small in the\nnoise strength. We provide quantitative predictions for the anticoncentration\nof generic circuits at finite depth, which we benchmark with numerical\nsimulations giving perfect agreement even for shallow circuits. Our findings\nare directly applicable to current quantum processors and demonstrate universal\nbehavior beyond random-matrix-theory regimes which are only applicable at large\ndepths."}

Our algorithm yields a doubly-exponential\nimprovement over existing methods, and it employs operations that are readily\naccessible in experimental settings: the preparation of an auxiliary squeezed\nvacuum, passive Gaussian unitaries, and homodyne detection. At its core lies an\nadaptive strategy that systematically reduces the total squeezing of the\nsystem, enabling efficient tomography. Quite surprisingly, this proves that\nestimating a Gaussian state in trace distance is generally more efficient than\ndirectly estimating its covariance matrix. Our algorithm is particularly\nwell-suited for applications in quantum metrology and sensing, where highly\nsqueezed - and hence high-energy - states are commonly employed.

In this work, we apply\nobject detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in\nsemiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with\nspin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points\nand their connectivity, which is crucial for virtual gate calibration, charge\nstate initialization, drift correction, and pulse sequencing. We show that it\nsurpasses convolutional neural networks in performance on three different spin\nqubit architectures, all without the need for retraining. In contrast to\nexisting approaches, our method significantly reduces complexity and runtime,\nwhile enhancing generalizability. The results highlight the potential of\ntransformer-based end-to-end learning frameworks as a foundation for a\nscalable, device- and architecture-agnostic tool for control and tuning of\nquantum dot devices."}

Here, we systematically\ninvestigate the rich phase structure emerging from a minimal model of\ncompeting, non-commuting weak measurements: nearest-neighbor Ising ($Z_iZ_j$)\nand single-qubit transverse ($X_i$) operators. We analyze three experimentally\nrelevant scenarios based on which measurement outcomes are read out: complete\nreadout, no readout, and partial readout. Using a replica mean-field theory for\nhigher dimensions, complemented by numerical simulations in one dimension, we\nderive the complete finite-time and stationary phase diagrams. Our analysis\nreveals a striking dependence on the readout protocol. Complete readout yields\na direct transition between a short-range entangled (SRE) phase and a pure LRE\nphase. No readout (pure decoherence) precludes entanglement but exhibits a\nstrong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) transition into a\nclassically ordered mixed state. Most intriguingly, partial readout\ninterpolates between these limits, featuring a mixed-state phase transition\nwhere the system can become trapped in the SWSSB phase or, for weaker\nnon-commutativity, undergo successive symmetry breaking to reach a mixed LRE\nphase. A novel technical contribution is the use of a channel-fidelity-based\npartition function that allows us to simultaneously characterize both\nentanglement and SWSSB order, revealing a deep interplay between them in the\nreplica limit.

A matter-wave interferometer\nwith a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the\nspatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely\nnew regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the\nquantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to\nrealize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus\non utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND\ntogether with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time.\nThere is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting\nthis technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our\nplans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor,\nhoping this will support this growing community.\n  In this work we demonstrate the neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds\nusing ultraviolet photoemission, and characterize the dependence of this\nprocess on both the illumination wavelength and particle size. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate discrete, single-electron charge manipulation of levitated\nnanodiamond in a needle Paul trap at a pressure of 0.5\\,Torr. Finally, we\ndemonstrate fast neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds, achieving a\nneutralization rate much faster than the state of the art.

We present a quantum numerical scheme based on\nthree steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant\nobservables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite\ndifference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula\napproximations, also known as Trotterization.

In this work, we\npropose an efficient method to detect non-absolutely separable states. Our\napproach relies on evaluating moments that can bypass the need for full state\ntomography, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. We then present\nseveral examples in support of our detection scheme. We also address a closely\nrelated problem concerning states whose partial transpose remains positive\nunder any arbitrary non-local unitary action. Furthermore, we examine the\neffectiveness of our moment-based approach in the detection of quantum channels\nthat are not absolutely separating, which entails the detection of resource\npreserving channels.

In this\nmodel, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical,\nwhile those at different distances are independent random variables (or their\nanalogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is\nalso considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are\nused to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal\nstates. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse\nparticipation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad.
