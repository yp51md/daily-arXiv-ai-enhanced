Here, we propose a\nsymmetry-engineering strategy to unlock altermagnetism in two dimensional (2D)\nantiferromagnetic systems via surface adsorption of atoms or molecules. By\nemploying spin group theory, we systematically demonstrate that selectively\nbreaking symmetry operations, specifically those protecting spin degeneracy in\nmomentum space, enables the emergence of nonrelativistic spin-split electronic\nstates. Meanwhile, preserving rotation or mirror symmetries connecting opposite\nsublattices ensures zero net magnetization. Through a comprehensive\nclassification of all symmetry operations across 80 layer groups, we identify\n63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups (SPGs) describing 2D materials and\nfurther isolate 15 groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics through\nsurface adsorption. Exemplified with monolayer antiferromagnetic VPS_3 and\nMnPSe_3, we show that oxygen adsorption on VPS_3 and NH_3 adsorption on MnPSe_3\nselectively disrupt PT symmetry while retaining the [C2||m] symmetry. This\nengineered symmetry reduction induces pronounced spin splitting in their band\nstructures without spin-orbit coupling, as confirmed by first-principles\ncalculations.

A key challenge\nlies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal\nquantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be\ninsufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as\nsuperconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations,\nwe show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations,\noccupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of\noff-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at\nhalf-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of\nthe superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of\nparticle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While\nthis symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it\nallows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal\ncorrelations."}

Here, we introduce a complete fault-tolerant\narchitecture for CE CSS codes based on dual-rail concatenation. After showing\nthat transversal CNOT gates violate CE code constraints, we introduce\nCE-preserving logical CNOT gates and modified Shor- and Steane-type syndrome\nextraction schemes using zero-controlled NOT gates and CE-compatible ancilla.\nThis enables fault-tolerant syndrome-extraction circuits fully compatible with\nCE constraints. We also present an extended stabilizer simulation algorithm\nthat efficiently tracks both stochastic and collective coherent noise. Using\nour framework, we identify minimal CE codes, including the $[[12,1,3]]$ and\n$[[14,3,3]]$ codes, and demonstrate that the $[[12,1,3]]$ code achieves strong\nperformance under coherent noise. Our results establish the first complete\nFTQEC framework for CE codes, demonstrating their robustness to coherent noise.\nThis highlights the potential of CE codes as a possible solution for quantum\nprocessors dominated by collective coherent noise."}

The system eigenspectrum is symmetric about a\ncritical point, $|\\vec{b}| = 0$, with four of the spectral components varying\napproximately linearly with the magnetic field and four exhibiting a nonlinear\ndependence. Under the adiabatic approximation and for appropriate initial\nstates, we show that the sensor's response to a zero-mean signal is such that\nbelow a threshold, $|\\vec{b}| < b_\\mathrm{th}$, the sensor does not respond to\nthe signal, whereas above the threshold, the sensor acts as a detector that the\nsignal has occurred. This thresholded response is approximately\nomnidirectional. Moreover, when deployed in an entangled multisensor\nconfiguration, the sensor achieves sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit. Such\ndetectors could be useful both as standalone units for signal detection above a\nnoise threshold and in two- or three-dimensional arrays, analogous to a quantum\nbubble chamber, for applications such as particle track detection and\nlong-baseline telescopy."}
