After a short initial diffusive\nphase the cloud settles down to a stationary state due to the onset of\ndynamical localization. In this work we realise an enhancement of localization\nby modification of the kick sequence. We experimentally implement the\nmodification to this system in which the sign of the kick sequence is flipped\nby allowing for a free evolution of the wavepackets for half the Talbot time\nafter every $M$ kicks. Depending on the value of $M$, this modified system\ndisplays a combination of enhanced diffusion followed by asymptotic\nlocalization. This is explained as resulting from two competing processes --\nlocalization induced by standard kicked rotor type kicks, and diffusion induced\nby half Talbot time evolution. The evolving states display a localized but\nnon-exponential wave function profiles. This provides another route to quantum\ncontrol in kicked rotor class of systems. The numerical simulations agree well\nwith the experimental results."}

This presents a significant challenge\nfor near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. To address this,\nwe introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Amplitude Estimation (AWQAE)\nframework, a modular, scalable and adaptive approach that decouples estimation\nprecision from the number of physical qubits required in a single circuit.\nAWQAE operates by iteratively estimating the phase bits in small, fixed-size\nchunks, using a number of smaller, independent quantum circuits, which are\namenable to parallel processing. A key technical contribution of this work is\nintroduction of a phase resolution circuit and an ancilla-guided mechanism that\nenables accurate chunk assignment and eigenphase reconstruction in the presence\nof multiple eigenstates. This design is inherently NISQ-friendly, by lowering\ncircuit depth and qubit count per block to reduce decoherence and noise\neffects. A key component of our approach is a robust classical post-processing\nalgorithm that resolves measurement ambiguities that arise during the iterative\nprocess. This post-processing routine uses a least-significant-bit\n(LSB)-to-most-significant-bit (MSB) correction to reconstruct the full,\nhigh-precision phase estimate, ensuring accuracy. By combining a modular\nquantum-classical loop with an ambiguity-aware reconstruction method, AWQAE\noffers a powerful and flexible solution for performing high-precision QAE on\nresource-constrained quantum hardware.

In this work, we ask the question: \"What is the\nmost efficient approach for implementing continuous rotations in a surface code\narchitecture?\" Several techniques have been developed to reduce the T-count or\nT-depth of rotations, such as Hamming weight phasing and catalyst towers.\nHowever, these methods often require additional a number of ancilla qubits, and\nthus the ultimate cost function one needs to optimise against should rather be\nthe total runtime or the total space required for performing a rotation. We\nexplicitly construct surface code layouts for catalyst towers in two practical\napplication examples in the context of option pricing: (a) implementing a phase\noracle circuit, which is a ubiquitous subroutine in many quantum algorithms,\nand (b) state preparation using a variational quantum circuit. Our analysis\nshows that, at small and medium code distances, catalyst towers not only reduce\nthe runtime but can also decrease the total spacetime volume of rotations.\nHowever, at large code distances, conventional Clifford+T synthesis may prove\nmore efficient. Additionally, we note that our conclusions are sensitive to\nspecific application scenarios and the choices of various parameters.\nNevertheless, catalyst towers may be particularly advantageous for early\nfault-tolerant quantum applications, where low and medium code distances are\nassumed and a spacetime tradeoff is needed to reduce the runtime of individual\ncircuit runs, such as in scenarios involving high circuit repetition counts."}

Subsequently, by\nrecognizing inherent symmetries present in the existing protocols, we design\nnovel QIA schemes based on secure computational and communication tasks.\nSpecifically, this work introduces a set of new QIA protocols that utilize\ncontrolled secure direct quantum communication. The proposed scheme facilitates\nmutual authentication between two users, Alice and Bob, with assistance from a\nthird party, Charlie, using Bell states. A comprehensive security analysis\ndemonstrates its robustness against impersonation, intercept-resend, and\nfraudulent authentication attacks.

This effect leads to\nthe emergence of a hybrid phase characterized by the coexistence of superfluid\nin one of the components and Mott insulator in the another one. Our findings\nhighlight the important role of a conserved quantities, which is magnetization\nhere, in reshaping the phase landscape, significantly influencing the stability\nand emergence of distinct quantum phases."}

Here we simulate the FNATI using a higher-dimensional photonic\nquantum walk and develop dynamic measurement schemes to demonstrate key\nsignatures of the FNATI. Importantly, combining a direct bulk-dynamic detection\nfor the underlying quaternion topological charge, and a spatially-resolved\ninjection spectroscopy for the edge states, we experimentally establish the\nmultifold bulk-boundary correspondence, and, in particular, identify the\nanomalous non-Abelian phase where edge states appear in all band gaps, despite\nthe presence of a trivial topological charge. Our experiment marks the first\nexperimental characterization of the FNATI, providing general insight into the\nnon-Abelian topological phases."}

We compare our results to those for a\nquasipure Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and find that for strong\nimpurity-bath interactions, the spectra narrow with increasing temperature,\nwhile the impurity energy shift is suppressed. Near the critical temperature\nfor condensation, many-body effects still play an important role, and only for\na nondegenerate bath, the system approaches the classical Boltzmann-gas\nbehavior. The key spectral features are reproduced within the theory of an\nideal Bose polaron."}
