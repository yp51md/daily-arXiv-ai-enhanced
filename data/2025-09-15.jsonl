Rev. E", "summary": "This article presents a Monte Carlo study on bond percolation in distorted\nsquare and triangular lattices. The distorted lattices are generated by\ndislocating the sites from their regular positions. The amount and direction of\nthe dislocations are random, but can be tuned by the distortion parameter\n$\\alpha$. Once the sites are dislocated, the bond lengths $\\delta$ between the\nnearest neighbors change. A bond can only be occupied if its bond length is\nless than a threshold value called the connection threshold $d$. It is observed\nthat when the connection threshold is greater than the lattice constant\n(assumed to be $1$), the bond percolation threshold $p_\\mathrm{b}$ always\nincreases with distortion. For $d\\le 1$, no spanning configuration is found for\nthe square lattice when the lattice is distorted, even very slightly. On the\nother hand, the triangular lattice not only spans for $d\\le 1$, it also shows a\ndecreasing trend for $p_\\mathrm{b}$ in the low-$\\alpha$ range. These variation\npatterns have been linked with the average coordination numbers of the\ndistorted lattices. A critical value $d_\\mathrm{c}$ for the connection\nthreshold has been defined as the value of $d$ below which no spanning\nconfiguration can be found even after occupying all the bonds satisfying the\nconnection criterion $\\delta\\le d$. The behavior of $d_\\mathrm{c}(\\alpha)$ is\nmarkedly different for the two lattices."}

Boundaries\nare ubiquitous in real systems, and critical behaviors near the boundary have\nattracted extensive research. Different boundary universality classes,\nincluding ordinary, special, extraordinary, and surface transitions, have been\nidentified. However, the driven critical dynamics near boundaries remains\nunexplored. Here, we systematically investigate the driven critical dynamics in\nvarious boundary universality classes of the Ising model in both two and three\ndimensions, and discover a wealth of dynamic scaling behaviors. We find that\nfor heating dynamics in all boundary universality classes, as well as for\ncooling dynamics in special, extraordinary, and surface transitions, the\ndynamic scaling behaviors of the order parameter can be described by a normal\ngeneralization of the KZM, called boundary finite-time scaling (BFTS). In\ncontrast, for cooling dynamics in ordinary transition, we discover an abnormal\nlogarithmic scaling on the driving rate. Moreover, for the special transition,\nin addition to temperature driving, we also consider the driven dynamics by\ndriving the surface couplings. For increasing the surface coupling across the\nspecial transition point along the line of the ordinary transition, the\nprerequisite of the KZM, which requires that the correlation length/time in the\ninitial state to be short-ranged, breaks down. We develop a generalized BFTS\nfor a nonequilibrium initial state characterized by the waiting time, or the\n``age'', of the boundary. Possible generalizations are also discussed."}

Another way is to use a stochastic approach where a random force is\nadded to the system. The benefit of the stochastic approach is to solve the\ndynamics of the system with less time and memory than the density matrix\napproaches. In this project we want to develop a stochastic approach that can\ndeal with the stochastic wave functions approach. We did this on a 2-level\nsystem and found that it works well when comparing to a density matrix\napproach. Next, we tested a quantum particle connect to a bath of harmonic\noscillators using the stochastic approach. We found that a friction term is\nnecessary and applied it.

However, the precise defect structure responsible for this behaviour is\nunknown. Here we have determined the intrinsic defect structure of\nPr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ using neutron and x-ray scattering techniques supported by\ndensity functional theory. We find the main defect is the stuffing of Zr$^{4+}$\nsites by Pr$^{3+}$ ions, accompanied by charge compensating O$^{2-}$ vacancies,\nand the relaxation of a neighbouring O$^{2-}$ ion to an interstitial site. Our\nresults explain the single-ion magnetism by considering the non-magnetic\nsinglets that arise on neighbouring sites as a result of the defect structure.\nThese singlets account for additional features in the crystal electric field\nexcitations. The effects caused by this low level of structural disorder are\nmagnified since several neighbouring Pr sites are affected. This makes a\nsignificant contribution towards the observed broadening of pinch points in the\nmagnetic diffuse scattering, which was previously attributed purely to quantum\neffects."}

Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in\nnanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has\nled to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties.\nThe mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and\nnanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature,\nsetting their force sensitivities below 1 $\\mathrm{aN}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$,\nsurpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs).

Across a 4-inch wafer, 8 dies yield\n2.9-3.1 dB directly measured quadrature squeezing with $< 0.2$ dB variation,\ndemonstrating excellent uniformity. This performance is enabled by\nco-integrating ultralow-loss, strongly overcoupled high-$Q$ microresonators,\ncascaded pump-rejection filters, and low-loss inverse-tapered edge couplers.\nThe measurements agree with a first-principles theoretical model parameterized\nsolely by independently extracted device parameters and experimental settings.\nThe measured squeezing level can be further improved by enhancing the\nefficiencies of off-chip detection and chip-to-fiber coupling. These results\nestablish a reproducible, wafer-scale route to nonclassical-light generation in\nintegrated photonics and lay the groundwork for scalable CV processors,\nmultiplexed entanglement sources, and quantum-enhanced sensing."}

Here, we use entanglement\nmicroscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions\nand subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the\nentanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine\nmultipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling\nof RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and\nunconventional XY$^*$, and N\\'eel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a\ndichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while\nnon-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy\nconfigurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of\nthree-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions.\nSimilar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this\nmultipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge\ntheories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in\nbeyond-Landau quantum critical theories."}

To\nutilize these devices for force sensing or quantum optomechanics, they must be\nbrought in close proximity with other systems for functionalization or\nefficient readout. Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in\nnanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has\nled to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties.\nThe mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and\nnanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature,\nsetting their force sensitivities below 1 $\\mathrm{aN}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$,\nsurpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs). Given\nthis new regime of sensitivity, an intriguing question is whether the proximity\nof other materials hinders mechanical coherence. Here we show: it does. We\nreport a novel dissipation mechanism that occurs in ultracoherent\nnanomechanical oscillators caused by the presence of nearby dielectrics. By\nstudying the parameter scaling of the effect, we show that the mechanism is\nmore severe for low-frequency mechanical modes and that it is due to dielectric\nloss within the materials caused by the motion of a resonator which carries\nstatic charges. Our observations are consistent with the noncontact friction\n(NCF) observed in AFMs. Our findings provide insights into limitations on the\nintegration of ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators and highlight the\nadverse effects of charged defects in these systems."}
