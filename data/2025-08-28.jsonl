For our main result, we show that\ntime-reversal invariant 3+1d lattice systems (such as Dirac and Weyl\nsemimetals) can never admit a lone low-energy symmetry-protected Dirac fermion\n(or node), i.e., it must always come in higher muliplets or be fine-tuned. This\ntheorem holds for both non-interacting and interacting systems as long as the\nelectromagnetic $U(1)_{V,{\\rm UV}}$ symmetry is a normal subgroup of the\nmicroscopic symmetry group $G_{\\mathrm{UV}}$; a condition that is ubiquitous in\nphysical $U(1)_{V,{\\rm UV}}$ preserving lattice models. To show that our\ntheorems are tight, we also explore both well-known and new systems that are\nconverses of the no-go theorem, obtained by forfeiting certain assumptions such\nas a broken time-reversal symmetry (magnetic Weyl semimetal), a non-compact\nnon-on-site $U(1)$ (almost local Dirac node model), no-symmetry protection\n(fine-tuned Dirac semimetal), or multiple low-energy Dirac nodes (time-reversal\ninvariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals). We will also explicitly demonstrate that,\nwhile this theorem strictly prohibits single time-reversal invariant\nsymmetry-protected Dirac node, it does allow for other odd numbers of Dirac\nnodes under certain circumstances, such as three Dirac nodes in the\nFu-Kane-Mele diamond lattice model. This is akin to the Nielsen-Ninomiya\ntheorem for an odd number of differently-charged chiral fermions, whose lattice\nrealizations are allowed if certain anomaly cancellation conditions are met."}

The novelty of QTI lies in its embedding of collapse\nwithin the conceptual language of critical phenomena in statistical physics.\nThe theory introduces measurable parameters (the amplification fraction, the\nrecord asymmetry, and the retrocausal coherence time) that serve as order\nparameters describing the quantum-classical transition. Collapse is thus\ncharacterized not as a mysterious fiat but as a phase transition, with\nthresholds and scaling laws analogous to magnetization in ferromagnets.

Collapse corresponds to the granularization of trajectories: the\nconversion of smooth, time-symmetric quantum evolution into discrete,\nirreversible records. Most importantly, QTI is testable.

In the layered\ndichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a\nuniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover\nfrom thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of\nquantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional\ntransverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the\nmicroscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that\nsingle-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle\ntransitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration\nrates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is\nrescaled as $T \\to h_x^n T$ with $n \\approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of\nfirst- and second-order single-particle processes. This enables us to\nreconstruct a microscopic relaxation pathway consisting of cyclical polaron\nleakage followed by cascades of tunneling events. Our results establish quantum\nsimulation as a powerful tool for inferring real-space mechanisms in strongly\ncorrelated systems and demonstrate a concrete strategy for bridging effective\nspin models with the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum materials."}

The impurity exhibits four phases\n$\\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment\n$\\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to\nthe expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less\nconsequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\\rm\nimp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows\nmonotonically from $\\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that\nof the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap\nbound state produces entropy overshoots above $\\ln 2$, saturating to $\\ln 2$ at\nhigh $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether\nimpurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains\neffectively decoupled, with entropy near $\\ln 2$, with some\nintermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\\delta \\to 0$.\nThese behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment\nphases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation\ntowers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the\nlocal-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond\nconventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity\ncontribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram."}

Full abstract is in the paper", "summary": "We study the isotropic spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single\nedge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits\nfour impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J>0$): a \\textit{Kondo\nphase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and\nthe impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\\ln 2$ at $T \\to \\infty$ to\n$0$ at $T\\to 0$; and an \\textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at\nstrong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound\nmode drives $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero\nat intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\\ln 2$ as $T \\to \\infty$ and to\n$0$ as $T \\to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J<0$): a local-moment (LM)\nphase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with\n$S_{\\mathrm{imp}}\\to \\ln 2$ as $T \\to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at\nintermediate scales; and a \\textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at\nstrong $|J|$, where $S_{\\mathrm{imp}}=\\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet\ndevelops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic\nunderstanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the\nfractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for\nantiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by\nboundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots\noccur for all $J<0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as\n$J\\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound\nmodes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this\nphenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free\nenergy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and\nfound to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact\ndiagonalization results."}

Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum\nanomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental\nverification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative\napproach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular\nbuilding blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D)\nhoneycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground\nstate and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to\nbe highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied\nstrain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1,\n0.

We use a\nmean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of\nimpurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the\nimpurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant\napproach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced\nlocalisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then\nstudy the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the\nimpurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey\ninterferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of\nimpurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the\nuniversal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when\nthe mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show\nthat mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and\nthat bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance\nat low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our\nresults showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities\ndephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise\ntemperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures."}
