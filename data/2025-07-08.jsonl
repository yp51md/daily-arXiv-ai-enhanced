In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of\nnoninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze\nmuch larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic\nAubry-Andr\\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential\n(AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections\nto noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least\nan $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and\nconverge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances.\nAdditionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this\nweakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport\ncapacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these\nresults demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak\ninteractions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization\npersists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We\nexpect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently\nstrong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true\nlocalized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed\ninteraction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized\nregime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon\narising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative\neffects."}

Unlike conventional CDW\nmaterials, which typically display subtle structural distortions or lattice\nmodulations, BaFe2Al9 undergoes a first-order phase transition in which lattice\nstrain plays a crucial role in the formation of the CDW state. To further\nexplore this unique behavior, we conducted high-pressure studies, examining the\nelectrical transport, magnetic, and structural properties to gain deeper\ninsight into the underlying CDW mechanism. At ambient pressure, electrical\nresistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the presence of a CDW\ntransition. Upon applying pressure, the CDW transition temperature (TCDW)\nshifts to higher values, reaching approximately 300 K near 3.2 GPa, and the\nelectrical resistivity increases, suggesting that pressure modulates the charge\ncarrier concentration. Furthermore, the initially sharp first-order transition\nbecomes more gradual, and analysis of the temperature derivative of resistivity\nindicates a crossover from first-order to second-order like behavior under\npressure. High-pressure magnetization measurements are consistent with the\nelectrical transport data, showing an enhancement of TCDW with increasing\npressure. The residual resistivity increases with pressure, while the Fermi\nliquid coefficient A decreases above 2 GPa, pointing to a possible Fermi\nsurface reconstruction. High-pressure synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction\n(XRD) measurements at room temperature reveal a lattice anomaly near 3.8 GPa,\nmarked by a distinct trend change in macrostrain, further supporting the\nexistence of a pressure induced structural response.

Motivated by\nthis, we introduce a phenomenological theory based on the assumption that the\nmost relevant states are characterized by the impurity correlated with at most\none boson, since they have the largest overlap with the uncorrelated states to\nwhich the most common experimental probes couple. These experimentally relevant\nstates can however decay to lower energy states characterised by correlations\ninvolving multiple bosons, and we model this using a minimal variational wave\nfunction combined with a complex impurity-boson interaction strength. We first\nmotivate this approach by comparing to a more elaborate theory that includes\ncorrelations with up to two bosons. Our phenomenological model is shown to\nrecover the main results of two recent experiments probing both the spectral\nand the non-equilibrium properties of the Bose polaron. Our work offers an\nintuitive framework for analyzing experimental data and highlights the\nimportance of understanding the complicated problem of the Bose polaron decay\nin a many-body setting."}

In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of\nnoninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze\nmuch larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic\nAubry-Andr\\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential\n(AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections\nto noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least\nan $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and\nconverge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances.\nAdditionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this\nweakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport\ncapacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these\nresults demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak\ninteractions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization\npersists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We\nexpect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently\nstrong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true\nlocalized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed\ninteraction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized\nregime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon\narising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative\neffects."}

Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic\nAubry-Andr\\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential\n(AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections\nto noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs).

Our detailed Berry curvature analysis further\nhelps to reveal that, whereas the gapped surface bands can contribute to the\nHall conductance when the chemical potential is tuned to overlap with the\nbands, these bands have no net contribution when the chemical potential is in\nthe gapped region, leaving the gapless bands to be the sole contributor to the\nHQAH conductance.

Previous work\non approximate simulation with decision diagrams exploits this trade-off by\nremoving less important nodes. In this work, instead of removing these nodes,\nwe try to find similar nodes to replace them, effectively slowing down the\nfidelity loss when reducing the memory. In addition, we adopt Locality\nSensitive Hashing (LSH) to drastically reduce the computational complexity for\nsearching for replacement nodes. Our new approach achieves a better\nmemory-accuracy trade-off for representing a quantum circuit with decision\ndiagrams with minimal run time overhead.

Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended\nregion of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the\nthermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes\nquantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a\nsemiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling\nevidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations,\nunlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature."}

It is therefore important to develop robust\nprotocols for characterizing the valley coupling. Here, we show that\nrealistically sized samplings of valley energy distributions tend to\ndramatically overestimate the average valley coupling. But we find that\nknowledge of the valley phase, in addition to the valley splitting, can\nsignificantly improve our estimates. Motivated by this understanding, we\npropose a novel method to probe the valley phase landscape across the quantum\nwell using simple $g$-factor measurements. An important calibration step in\nthis procedure is to measure $g$ in a loop enclosing a valley vortex, where the\nvalley phase winds by $\\pm 2\\pi$ around a zero of the valley splitting. This\nproposal establishes an important new tool for probing spin qubits, and it can\nbe implemented in current experiments."}
