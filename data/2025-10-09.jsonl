In this paper, a detailed study of the\nentropic moments and of the R\\'enyi and Tsallis information entropies for the\nquantum version of the one-dimensional Darboux III oscillator is presented. In\nparticular, analytical expressions for the aforementioned quantities in\nposition space are obtained. Since the Fourier transform of the Darboux III\nwave functions does not admit a closed form expression, a numerical analysis of\nthese quantities has been performed. Throughout the paper the interplay between\nthe entropy parameter $\\alpha$ and the nonlinearity parameter $\\lambda$ is\nanalysed, and known results for the Shannon entropy of the Darboux III and for\nthe R\\'enyi and Tsallis entropies of the harmonic oscillator are recovered in\nthe limits $\\alpha \\to 1$ and $\\lambda \\to 0$, respectively.

Importantly, we identify a specific range of\nmaterial parameters within which the skyrmion velocity changes sharply while\nthe Hall angle remains strongly suppressed, saturating near zero. This\ncomprehensive parameter-dependent study establishes a universal design\nframework for minimizing the Hall effect in thermal gradient driven spintronic\nsystems."}

Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of\nMIP*=RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that\nthe same compression procedure in MIP* =RE also has the same desired property\nin the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the\ncompression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous\nframework used by Mousavi et al. [STOC 2022], as well as the improved Pauli\nbasis test introduced by de la Salle [ArXiv:2204.07084].\n  We introduce a new equivalence condition for RE/coRE-complete problems, which\nwe call the weakly compressible condition. We show that both MIP* and MIPco\nsatisfy this condition through the compression theorem, and thereby establish\nthat the uncomputability for MIP* and MIPco can be proved under a unified\nframework (despite these two complexity classes being different). Notably, this\napproach also gives an alternative proof of the MIP*=RE theorem, which does not\nrely on the preservation of the entanglement bound.

Within\nGrover's oracle, the compliance is computed through the finite-element method\n(FEM) using established quantum algorithms, including block-encoding of the\nstiffness matrix, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) for matrix\ninversion, Hadamard test, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). The complete\nalgorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit\nsimulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the\ncompliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in\npolynomial time. In the global search, our approach maintains Grover's\nquadratic speedup compared to classical unstructured search. Overall, the\nproposed quantum workflow demonstrates how quantum algorithms can advance the\nfield of computational science and engineering."}

In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a\nsimilar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time\nof quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue\nof the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of\ntwo replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of\nHamiltonians with local energy barriers. Our main result provides a rigorous\nlower bound on the spectral gap of the combined system's Lindbladian, which\nleads to an exponential improvement in spectral gap with respect to the barrier\nheight. We showcase the applicability of our method with several examples,\nincluding the defected 1D Ising model at arbitrary constant temperature, and\ndefected non-commuting local Hamiltonians at high temperature.

Recently, such measurements have also been used in quantum\nalgorithms based on Regev's reduction. The key problem for these algorithms is\nthe S-LWE problem for lattice problems, or the Quantum Decoding Problem for\ncode problems. A key idea for addressing this problem is to use unambiguous\nmeasurements to recover $k$ coordinates of a code (or lattice) element $x$ from\na quantum state $|\\psi_x\\rangle$, which corresponds to a noisy word $x$ with\nerrors in quantum superposition. However, a general theoretical framework to\nanalyze this approach has been lacking.\n  In this work, we introduce the notion of fine-grained unambiguous\nmeasurements. Given a family of states\n$\\{\\,|\\psi_x\\rangle\\,\\}_{x\\in\\{0,1\\}^n}$, we ask whether there exist\nmeasurements that can return, with certainty, $k$ bits of information about\n$x$. We study this question in the setting of symmetric states, which naturally\narises in the Quantum Decoding Problem. We show that determining the maximal\nnumber of parities that a measurement can output can be formulated as a linear\nprogram, and we use its dual formulation to derive several upper bounds. In\nparticular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence\nof fine-grained unambiguous measurements and prove impossibility results\nshowing, in particular, that such measurements cannot improve upon the approach\nof arXiv:2310.20651. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for\nthe Quantum Decoding Problem."}

Testing bosonic quantum states", "comment": "47 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of\ncontinuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical\nsystems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a\nfundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we\nefficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the\nperspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory,\ncharacterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of\nthe number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of\ncopies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then\nextend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies\nsuffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are\nfar. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states\nnecessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a\nfundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on\nrotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently\nintroduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds."}

In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted\nlocality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices,\nwhich provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary\nsymmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation\nsymmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted\nlocality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its\nanomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the\nsubscript $\\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by\ncomplex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple\nLieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous\nsymmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement\narea law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an\nanomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that\nhas an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state,\nas long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range\nof the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions,\nthe last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$\nis the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general\ntheorems in various concrete examples."}
