MCMs can be modeled by quantum instruments (a type of quantum operation or process), which can be characterized self-consistently using gate set tomography. However, experimentally estimated quantum instruments are often hard to interpret or relate to device physics. We address this challenge by adapting the error generator formalism -- previously used to interpret noisy quantum gates by decomposing their error processes into physically meaningful sums of \"elementary errors\" -- to MCMs. We deploy our new analysis on a transmon qubit device to tease out and quantify error mechanisms including amplitude damping, readout error, and imperfect collapse. We examine in detail how the magnitudes of these errors vary with the readout pulse amplitude, recover the key features of dispersive readout predicted by theory, and show that these features can be modeled parsimoniously using a reduced model with just a few parameters."}

Rather than addressing what is oscillating (excitonic versus vibronic) or quantum-versus-classical semantics, this work reframes long-lived beatings as a protocol-level dynamical effect: correlation-mediated retrieval under ultrafast control."}

Our position rests on three key points: verified training data enables models to internalize precise constraints as learned structures rather than statistical approximations; verification must constrain generation rather than filter outputs, as valid designs occupy exponentially shrinking subspaces; and domains where physical laws impose correctness criteria require verification embedded as architectural primitives. Early experiments showed LLMs without data verification could only achieve a maximum accuracy of 79% in circuit optimization. Our positions are formulated as quantum computing and AI4Research community imperatives, calling for elevating verification from afterthought to architectural foundation in AI4Research."}

Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram."}

Using the maximally symmetric Jx lattice as an ideal platform and introducing specifically engineered (ABBA-type) symmetry-preserving non-Hermitian disorder, we observe a sequence of disorder-induced phase transitions: from a trivial insulator into and through a non-Hermitian topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phase, culminating in a stable anomalous non-Hermitian TAI phase characterized by a quantized polarization P_x \\approx 0.25. Within this anomalous phase protected by the mobility gap, the zero-energy modes exhibit a distinct (N/2)-mode coalescence that scales with system size.

In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior. The above results present a rich picture of string breaking dynamics in a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain and provide insights for studying confinement physics and related gauge field theory phenomena on quantum simulation platforms."}

Such behavior has been attributed to substantial bond-dependent Kitaev interactions in combination with single-ion anisotropy, placing Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ among honeycomb compounds of interest for unconventional magnetic phases. Motivated by these observations, we present a first-principles-based analysis of the magnetic interactions in Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$. By combining density-functional calculations with microscopic modeling, we extract the relevant exchange parameters and construct an effective spin model that quantitatively reproduces both the elastic neutron-scattering spectra and the magnetization curve. The model captures the experimentally observed zero-field zigzag magnetic order, and proposes a $\\textit{double-zigzag}$ state at intermediate magnetic fields, realizing the 1/3-magnetization plateau in a simpler way than suggested in previous works. Crucially, we show that the one-third magnetization plateau does not require Kitaev interactions; instead, it arises from the interplay of strong out-of-plane single-ion anisotropy and competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and antiferromagnetic third-neighbor ($J_3$) Heisenberg couplings. These results establish a consistent microscopic description of Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ and clarify the origin of its field-induced plateau phase."}

First, we introduce a hardware-aware native formulation for multi-state probabilistic digits (p-dits) that avoids the locally dense intra-variable couplings required by binary Ising encodings. We validate p-dit dynamics by reproducing known critical behavior of the 2D Potts model. Second, we propose mean-field constraints (MFC), a hybrid scheme that replaces dense pairwise constraint couplings with dynamically updated single-node biases. Applied to balanced graph partitioning, MFC achieves solution quality comparable to exact all-to-all constraint formulations while dramatically reducing graph density. Finally, we demonstrate the practical impact of restored sparsity by an FPGA implementation, enabling orders-of-magnitude acceleration over CPU-based solvers. Together, these results outline a pathway for scaling constrained optimization on probabilistic hardware."}

The obtained results are considered in the framework of Faraday electromagnetic induction, which indicates that Landau quantization leads to the emergence of induced irradiation similar to Josephson and Andreev generation. Moreover, the detected maxima in the spectral characteristics correspond to odd fractional values of the resistance quantum staircases, while the dips in the electroluminescence spectra are observed at even fractional values of the resistance quantum ladder, which is due to the increased formation of composite bosons and fermions, respectively."}

We investigate a two-dimensional disordered network metamaterial constructed from a Delaunay triangulation of an underlying point cloud. Small perturbations in the point cloud induce discrete topological changes. One such change we identify is a Delaunay flip, in which two neighboring Delaunay triangles that form a convex quadrilateral structure with their common edge being one of the two quadrilateral diagonals exchange this diagonal for the other diagonal. These topological changes can cause substantial jumps in the effective resistance measured diagonally across the network, when the change is located near the source or the sink node. The jumps are explained analytically by showing that the change in effective resistance from edge removal or addition depends on the voltage drop across that edge. However, Delaunay flips have less impact on global resistance measurements and in larger networks. These local topological changes are relevant for finite-sized samples and experimentally-measurable properties such as electrical transport. Global characterizations of the network disorder or topology lack the location-specificity of our observed effects on network transport, and thus may be inadequate for predicting certain experimentally measurable transport properties in disordered network metamaterials, highlighting the importance of localized regions in material design."}

However, these methods typically target the zero-temperature limit, where systems collapse onto optimal configurations, a.k.a. the ground states. Real-world systems often occupy intermediate regimes where entropy and cost minimization genuinely compete, producing configurations that are structured yet sub-optimal. The Sub-Optimal Transport (SOT) model captures this competition through an ensemble of weighted bipartite graphs: a coupling parameter interpolates between entropy-dominated dense configurations and cost-dominated sparse structures. This crossover has been observed numerically but lacked analytical understanding. Here we develop a mean-field theory that characterizes this transition. We show that local fluctuations in Lagrange multipliers become sub-extensive in the thermodynamic limit, reducing the full model with strength constraints to an effective single-constraint problem admitting an exact solution in some intermediate regime. The resulting free energy is analytic in the coupling parameter, confirming a smooth crossover rather than a phase transition. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic observables and weight distributions, validated against numerical simulations. These results establish the first analytical description of the SOT model, extending statistical mechanics methods beyond the zero-temperature regime."}

In this work, we explore a solvable model of optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We consider the optimal schedule $η_T^\\star(t)$ where $t$ is the current iterate and $T$ is the total training horizon. This schedule is computed both numerically and analytically (when possible) using optimal control methods. Our analysis reveals two regimes which we term the easy phase and hard phase. In the easy phase the optimal schedule is a polynomial decay $η_T^\\star(t) \\simeq T^{-ξ} (1-t/T)^δ$ where $ξ$ and $δ$ depend on the properties of the features and task. In the hard phase, the optimal schedule resembles warmup-stable-decay with constant (in $T$) initial learning rate and annealing performed over a vanishing (in $T$) fraction of training steps. We investigate joint optimization of learning rate and batch size, identifying a degenerate optimality condition. Our model also predicts the compute-optimal scaling laws (where model size and training steps are chosen optimally) in both easy and hard regimes. Going beyond SGD, we consider optimal schedules for the momentum $β(t)$, where speedups in the hard phase are possible. We compare our optimal schedule to various benchmarks in our task including (1) optimal constant learning rates $η_T(t) \\sim T^{-ξ}$ (2) optimal power laws $η_T(t) \\sim T^{-ξ} t^{-χ}$, finding that our schedule achieves better rates than either of these.

Transport measurements in lightly doped and oxygen-enriched LSCO reveal a strongly insulating normal state governed by variable-range hopping, accompanied by pronounced nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and, at low temperatures, current-induced negative differential resistance. With increasing carrier concentration, these features evolve into regimes characterized by granular and percolative superconductivity near the threshold of bulk superconductivity and, eventually, into a homogeneous strange-metal state close to optimal doping. Throughout this evolution, the transport response shows marked sensitivity to disorder, electronic inhomogeneity, and external control parameters, such as bias current and magnetic field. Rather than reflecting a sequence of sharply distinct phases, the observed transport regimes form a continuous crossover from a localization-dominated insulating state to granular superconductivity and further to a coherent metallic state. This crossover is driven primarily by the progressive enhancement of electronic screening, inter-region coupling, and superconducting connectivity, rather than by abrupt changes in the underlying microscopic scattering mechanisms. Taken together, the available transport data provide a coherent experimental basis for understanding how disorder and mesoscale electronic inhomogeneity organize charge transport and superconductivity across the LSCO phase diagram, underscoring the central role of percolation and nonequilibrium effects in underdoped cuprates."}

We show that transverse connectivity between chains qualitatively reshapes the phase diagram, substantially enlarging the tetramer region and, in particular, stabilizing weakly bound tetramers when compared to the one-dimensional chains.

However, these methods typically target the zero-temperature limit, where systems collapse onto optimal configurations, a.k.a. the ground states. Real-world systems often occupy intermediate regimes where entropy and cost minimization genuinely compete, producing configurations that are structured yet sub-optimal. The Sub-Optimal Transport (SOT) model captures this competition through an ensemble of weighted bipartite graphs: a coupling parameter interpolates between entropy-dominated dense configurations and cost-dominated sparse structures. This crossover has been observed numerically but lacked analytical understanding. Here we develop a mean-field theory that characterizes this transition. We show that local fluctuations in Lagrange multipliers become sub-extensive in the thermodynamic limit, reducing the full model with strength constraints to an effective single-constraint problem admitting an exact solution in some intermediate regime. The resulting free energy is analytic in the coupling parameter, confirming a smooth crossover rather than a phase transition. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic observables and weight distributions, validated against numerical simulations. These results establish the first analytical description of the SOT model, extending statistical mechanics methods beyond the zero-temperature regime."}

While our previous work Jaiswal [2025] established that this model mimics BH formation conditions even when the Hoop conjecture is seemingly violated, we here focus on the resulting stationary radiation spectrum and its detectability. By mapping the spin chain dynamics to a Dirac fermion in a curved (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, we analyze the radiation using two complementary approaches: field-theoretic modes and operational quantum sensors. First, using localized Gaussian wave packets to model realistic detectors, we find that the radiation spectrum exhibits deviations from the ideal Planckian form, analogous to frequency-dependent greybody factors, while retaining robust Poissonian statistics that signal the loss of formation-scale information. Second, we introduce a qubit coupled to the chain as a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the qubit functions as a faithful quantum sensor of the Hawking temperature only in the weak-coupling regime, where its population dynamics are governed solely by the bath spectral density. In the strong-coupling limit, the probe thermalizes with the global environment, obscuring the horizon-induced thermal signature. These results provide a clear operational protocol for distinguishing genuine analog HR from environmental noise in quantum simulation platforms."}

The associated Hamiltonian is derived explicitly from Maxwell's equations, allowing the construction of bosonic ladder operators. The generalized flux is directly deduced from the electromagnetic potentials $A,V$ by a proper gauge choice, generalizing Devoret's approach [2]. Our analysis unifies the treatment of cylindrical and Cartesian guided modes under a consistent and generic framework, ensuring both theoretical insight and experimental relevance. We derive mode-specific capacitance and inductance from the field profiles and express voltage and current in terms of the canonical field variables. Measurable quantities are therefore properly defined from the mode quantum operators, especially for the non-trivial TM and TE ones.

Carrying out simulations for the three representative initial conditions, namely step, flat, and stationary ones, we not only confirm theoretical predictions available for the step case, but also characterize large deviations for the flat and stationary cases which have not been investigated before. We reveal in particular an unexpected robustness of the deeply negative large deviation regime with respect to different initial conditions. We attribute this robustness to the spontaneous formation of a wedge shape in interface profile.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We investigate the emergence and detection of Hawking radiation (HR) in a 1D chiral spin chain model, where the gravitational collapse is simulated by a sudden quantum quench that triggers a horizon-inducing phase transition. While our previous work Jaiswal [2025] established that this model mimics BH formation conditions even when the Hoop conjecture is seemingly violated, we here focus on the resulting stationary radiation spectrum and its detectability. By mapping the spin chain dynamics to a Dirac fermion in a curved (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, we analyze the radiation using two complementary approaches: field-theoretic modes and operational quantum sensors. First, using localized Gaussian wave packets to model realistic detectors, we find that the radiation spectrum exhibits deviations from the ideal Planckian form, analogous to frequency-dependent greybody factors, while retaining robust Poissonian statistics that signal the loss of formation-scale information. Second, we introduce a qubit coupled to the chain as a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the qubit functions as a faithful quantum sensor of the Hawking temperature only in the weak-coupling regime, where its population dynamics are governed solely by the bath spectral density. In the strong-coupling limit, the probe thermalizes with the global environment, obscuring the horizon-induced thermal signature. These results provide a clear operational protocol for distinguishing genuine analog HR from environmental noise in quantum simulation platforms."}

While a range of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have recently been observed in two-dimensional twisted moire systems, the theoretically anticipated filling factor v = -1/3 FQAH state has remained elusive, with debates centering on its nature of charge density wave or a topological Chern insulator. Here, we report the optical detection of a v = -1/3 FQAH state in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Using photoluminescence (PL) and reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) techniques, we identify ferromagnetic states at filling factors v = -1, -2/3, and -1/3, all tunable by a vertical electric field. The corresponding Curie temperatures are approximately 11 K, 3.5 K, and 2.4 K, respectively. The -1/3 state emerges over a narrower electric field range and a lower temperature compared to the integer and other fractional states, indicating its fragile nature that may lead to its absence in previous reports. Notably, the PL spectra at v = -1/3 disperse as the out-of-plane magnetic field increases, consistent with a nontrivial topological origin. Theoretical calculations based on the exact diagonalization method further support the interpretation of this topologically non-trivial state."}

The theoretical modeling of these processes often applies an approximate phase-space expansion of the nonclassical driving field in terms of coherent states, which has been shown to accurately predict the harmonic spectrum. However, its accuracy for the computation of quantum optical observables like the degree of squeezing and photon statistics has not been thoroughly considered. In this work, we introduce this approximative phase-space description and discuss its accuracy, and we find that it mischaracterizes the quantum optical properties of the driving laser by making it an incoherent mixture of classical states. We further show that this error in the driving field description maps onto the light emitted from HHG, as neither sub-Poissonian photon statistics nor quadrature squeezing below vacuum fluctuations can be captured by the approximative phase-space description. Lastly, to benchmark the approximative phase-space description, we consider the quantum HHG from a one-band model, which yields an exact analytical solution. Using the approximative phase-space representation with this specific model, we find a small quantitative error in the quadrature variance of the emitted field that scales with pulse duration and emitter density. Our results show that using this approximative phase-space description can mischaracterize quantum optical observables. Attributing physical meaning to such results should therefore be accompanied by a quantitative analysis of the error."}

In contrast to previously studied distortion schemes that preserve lattice geometry, linear distortion dislocates regular lattice sites along a fixed direction. Nearest-neighbors of a regular lattice need to satisfy a distance-based connection criterion to remain neighbors in the linearly distorted lattice. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analyses, we examine how site and bond percolation thresholds vary with the distortion parameter and the connection threshold. For triangular lattices, we observe pronounced directional dependence of both site and bond percolation thresholds, as well as of the critical connection threshold. This arises from the distortion-induced anisotropic modification of nearest-neighbor separations. In particular, bond percolation exhibits nontrivial behavior that cannot be explained solely in terms of changes in the average coordination number. In contrast, square lattices remain effectively isotropic under linear distortion, resulting in identical percolation thresholds for distortions applied along different directions. Percolation thresholds in the thermodynamic limit, evaluated for a selected set of values of distortion parameter and connection threshold, confirm that the results for large finite lattices provide reliable estimates of the infinite-system behavior."}

Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case.

For measuring the squeezed quadrature, we explore two approaches: Direct detection of the output intensity, which is simple, but requires a high-efficiency photo-detector; and parametric homodyne with an additional OPA, which accepts practical detectors with no efficiency limitation, but is technically more complex. Our analysis demonstrates super-classical sensitivity under most realistic conditions of loss and detector inefficiency, thereby leveraging the resources of squeezing and the principles of SU(1,1) interference, while maintaining compatibility with standard Sagnac configurations."}

The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian.

We consider two working substances--a single spin-$1/2$ and a pair of interacting spin-$1/2$ particles--and investigate the cycle performance by taking the regeneration cost at its minimum value set by the Carnot heat-pump limit. For comparison, we also analyze the conventional Stirling cycle without regeneration under the same conditions. The super-Carnot efficiencies reported under the cost-free regeneration assumption disappear once the regeneration cost is included: the modified efficiency stays below the Carnot bound, while still remaining higher than the efficiency of the conventional Stirling cycle.

We analyze the hypothesis testing problem of distinguishing whether an unknown state $ρ$ is equal to a reference $ρ_0$ or $ε$-far from it. We derive the minimax sample complexity for this problem, quantifying the information-theoretic price of non-destructive measurements.

It is well-known that while such equations describe the evolution of probabilities, they do not automatically justify classical reasoning based on the assumption that the system exists in a definite state at intermediate times. On the other hand, we show that this assumption is crucial for the standard calculation of stochastic times such as the persistent time and the time of first arrivals. We then consider examples of single particles, bosons, and fermions in the so-called ultradecoherence limit to illustrate how classical stochasticity may emerge from quantum mechanics."}

We show that TN pre-optimization can mitigate the barren plateau issue by giving access to enhanced gradient zones that do not shrink exponentially with system size. We evaluate the classical simulation cost evaluating energies at these warm-starts, and identify regimes where quantum hardware offers better scaling than TN simulations."}

This paper proposes a formulation of single-query quantum decision trees as weighted graphs. This formulation has the advantage that it facilitates the analysis of the $L_1$ spectral norm of the algorithm output. This advantage is based on the fact that a high $L_1$ spectral norm of the output of a quantum decision tree is a necessary condition to outperform its classical counterpart. We propose heuristics for maximizing the $L_{1}$ spectral norm, show how to combine weighted graphs to generate sequences with strictly increasing norm, and present functions exhibiting exponential quantum advantage. Finally, we establish a necessary condition linking single-query quantum advantage to the asymptotic growth of measurement projector dimensions."}

Among its most compelling applications is digital quantum simulation, where quantum computers are used to replicate the behavior of other quantum systems. This could enable the study of problems that are otherwise intractable on classical computers, transforming fields such as quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science. Despite this potential, realizations of practical quantum advantage for relevant problems are hindered by imperfections of current devices. This also affects quantum hardware based on superconducting circuits which is among the most advanced and scalable platforms. The envisaged long-term solution of fault-tolerant quantum computers that correct their own errors remains out of reach mainly due to the associated qubit number overhead. As a result, the field has developed strategies that combine quantum and classical resources, exploit hardware-native operations, and employ error mitigation techniques to extract meaningful results from noisy data. This doctoral thesis contributes to this broader effort by exploring methods for advancing quantum simulation across the full computational stack, including hardware-level innovations, refined techniques for noise modeling and error mitigation, and algorithmic improvements enabled by efficient measurement processing."}

We show that in the high-density regime relevant to the experiment, diagonal Ising interactions -- often treated as perturbative -- generate profound inhomogeneous broadening that exceeds the intrinsic single-particle dephasing. This intense diagonal disorder suppresses resonant flip-flop exchange, effectively renormalizing the density of states available for spectral diffusion. Our parameter-free analytic theory quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed microsecond dynamics, identifying Ising-induced broadening as the governing mechanism for energy transport in dense solid-state spin ensembles."}

In this paper, we harness the flexibility of digitized computers to derive a digitized adiabatic algorithm able to reduce the gate-demanding costs of implementing factorization. To this end, we propose a new approach for adiabatic factorization by encoding the solution of the problem in the kernel subspace of the problem Hamiltonian, instead of using ground-state encoding considered in the standard adiabatic factorization proposed by Peng $et$ $al$.

Our encoding enables the design of adiabatic factorization algorithms belonging to the class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) methods, instead the Polinomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO) used by standard adiabatic factorization. We illustrate the performance of our QUBO algorithm by implementing the factorization of integers $N$ up to 8 bits. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement over the PUBO formulation, both in terms of reduced circuit complexity and increased fidelity in identifying the correct solution."}

The resulting classification of multipartite states captures their experimental cost: creating a k-partite entangled state requires at least k-1 two-particle entangling gates. Further, we analytically calculate the newly defined k-partite entanglement of formation, which generalizes an important bipartite entanglement measure, in several classes of states, including the W states of any dimension."}

We initialize the system in the ground state of the Hamiltonian in either the BTC or the non-BTC phase, and drive it across the BTC transition. The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the finite-size scaling of the first critical time and find convergence to a constant in the thermodynamic limit, with distinct power-law approaches for the quench and the ramp protocols."}

We then introduce important technologies and concepts related to DiVincenzo's criteria, which are the necessary conditions for the superconducting qubits to work as a useful quantum computer. Firstly, we will discuss various types of superconducting qubits formed with Josephson junctions, from which we will understand the trade-off across multiple design parameters, including their noise immunity. Secondly, we will discuss different schemes to achieve entanglement gate operations, which are a major bottleneck in achieving more efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing.

We provide theoretical and numerical evidence supporting the conjectured hardness of learning the private key (the circuit) from the public key (the shadow). A key technical ingredient enabling our scheme is an improved state-certification primitive that achieves higher noise tolerance and lower sample complexity than prior methods. We realize this certification by designing a high-rate error-detecting code tailored to our random-circuit ensemble and experimentally generating shadows for 32-qubit states using circuits with $\\geq 80$ logical ($\\geq 582$ physical) two-qubit gates, attaining 0.90 $\\pm$ 0.01 fidelity.

Specifically, we identify the minimal improvements required beyond the state-of-the-art to achieve an end-to-end expected teleportation fidelity of $2/3$, which represents the classical limit. To this end, we formulate the hardware requirements computation as optimisation problems, where the hardware parameters representing the underlying device capabilities serve as decision variables. Assuming a simplified noise model, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the teleportation fidelity and rate when the network is realised using heterogeneous quantum hardware, including a quantum repeater chain with a memory cut-off. Our derivations are based on events defined by the order statistics of link generation durations in both the metropolitan networks and the backbone, and the resulting expressions are validated through simulations on the NetSquid platform. The analytical expressions facilitate efficient exploration of the optimisation parameter space without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We then apply this framework to a representative realisation in which the metropolitan nodes are based on trapped-ion processors and the backbone is composed of ensemble-based quantum memories. Our results suggest that teleportation across metropolitan distances is already achievable with state-of-the-art hardware when the data qubit is prepared after end-to-end entanglement has already been established, whereas extending teleportation to intercity scales requires additional, though plausibly achievable, improvements in hardware performance."}

By employing a tight-binding Hamiltonian, we characterize the topological phase transition occurring at a critical intra-sublattice hopping strength ($t_a^C$). We examine the emergence of Dirac nodal points and the resulting Berry curvature singularities, supported by a visual analysis of pseudospin texture winding. Crucially, we analize spin splitting, effective altermagnetic strength, and investigate the transport implications of these phases, uncovering giant conductivity anisotropy and spin-dependent \"steering\" effects driven by group velocity distribution across the Fermi surface. Beyond bulk properties, we analyze the edge state topology in ribbon geometries through the lens of information-theoretic markers like fidelity-susceptibility and inverse participation ratio, offering an alternative to traditional Chern number calculations.
