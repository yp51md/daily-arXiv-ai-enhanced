We optimize collision gates for fermionic Lithium atoms confined in a double-well potential, controlling the laser amplitude and keeping its relative phase constant. We obtain high-fidelity gates based on a one-dimensional confinement simulation. Our approach extends beyond earlier Fermi-Hubbard simulations by capturing a momentum dependence in the interaction energy. This leads to a higher interaction strength when atoms begin in separate subwells compared to the same subwell. This momentum dependence might limit the gate fidelity under realistic experimental conditions, but also enables tailored applications in quantum chemistry and quantum simulation by optimizing gates for each of these cases separately."}

This chapter introduces the principles of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology and explores their applications to timekeeping. We review the theoretical framework of quantum phase estimation, comparing frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and discuss paradigmatic entangled states such as spin-squeezed and GHZ states. Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges posed by decoherence, which constrain the practical advantages that can be realized in large-scale devices. The discussion then turns to frequency estimation in atomic clocks, highlighting how experimental constraints shape the translation of abstract quantum limits into real performance gains. Finally, we outline emerging directions of contemporary quantum metrology. Together, these developments underscore the increasingly close interplay between quantum information processing and precision metrology."}

The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.\n  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.\n  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point."}

While the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is known to be robust against weak perturbations, its fate under strong disorder, particularly in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), is not fully understood. Here, we uncover a Z_2 topological bipolar skin effect in a non-Hermitian Rashba chain, where spin-up and spin-down eigenstates localize at opposite boundaries. By strictly computing the Lyapunov exponents and introducing a biorthogonal spin-separation index, we map the global phase diagram and reveal a hierarchical breakdown of topology. We demonstrate that the Z_2 skin effect is protected against moderate disorder but collapses into a trivial skin phase before the ultimate onset of Anderson localization. Our results establish a distinct regime of disorder-robust topological non-reciprocity, distinguishable from both the trivial bulk limit and the Anderson localized phase."}

Using the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we show that distinct QSL phases exhibit strikingly different strain responses. The semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and the gapped chiral spin liquid display pronounced Landau quantization and a diamagnetic-like response to strain, whereas the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without forming Landau levels. These contrasting behaviors provide a direct route to experimentally identifying and distinguishing QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. We further outline how local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy can detect the strain-induced resonances associated with these responses, offering a practical pathway towards identifying fractionalized excitations in candidate materials."}

Using simulations of tunable resistor networks, we demonstrate that this strategy enables robust memory of multiple sequential tasks while reducing the number of edges and the overall tuning cost. Our results hint at constrained training as a simple, local, and scalable mechanism to overcome catastrophic forgetting in tunable matter."}

Existing approximation strategies sacrifice either fidelity or efficiency, limiting their practical utility.

Unlike classical sampling or surrogate methods, our approach provides fully faithful explanations without approximation trade-offs for tractable graph sizes. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic graph datasets, demonstrating that QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding the performance of classical methods across all evaluation metrics. These results collectively demonstrate that QGShap not only preserves exact Shapley faithfulness but also delivers interpretable, stable, and structurally consistent explanations that align with the underlying graph reasoning of GNNs.

While such systems are abundant in nature, their understanding is limited to the single-particle level or phenomenological mean-field theories. Here, we introduce a minimal model of many trail-interacting particles that extends this paradigm to the fluctuating collective level. Particles diffuse while depositing long-lasting repelling/attracting trails that act as a shared memory field, coupling their dynamics across time and space. Using stochastic density functional theory, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations and analyze analytically and numerically the resulting behaviors. We show that memory, coupled with fluctuations, fundamentally reshapes collective dynamics; In the repulsive case, the particle density displays superdiffusive spreading characterized by transient clustering and ballistic motion; In the attractive case, the system condensates in finite time into frozen, localized states. Our results establish general principles for trail-interacting systems and reveal how persistent fields generate novel instabilities and self-organization."}

The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.\n  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.\n  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point."}

Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics."}

Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model."}

However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet. As an application, we theoretically demonstrate spin-current generation driven by elastic waves in a specific collinear antiferromagnet, fully independent of spin-orbit coupling."}

In this work, we demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field lifts this prohibition, inducing a planar magnetotransport that directly probes the intrinsic quantum geometry and the distinctive $C_n\\mathcal{T}$ nature of altermagnetic orders.

Our work establishes distinctive signatures of altermagnetism in linear and nonlinear magnetotransport, providing a general framework for measuring quantum geometric responses and probing altermagnetic order."}

Realizing accurate analog simulations requires high-fidelity time-dependent pulse control, yet existing calibration schemes are tailored to digital gate characterization and cannot be readily extended to learn continuous pulse trajectories. We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, our method reconstructs a smooth pulse directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator, without requiring mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution. Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy with strong efficiency and robustness against SPAM as well as depolarizing errors, providing a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators capable of detecting major hardware faults."}

Version to appear in Applied Physics A", "summary": "We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering."}

Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model."}

Using simulations of tunable resistor networks, we demonstrate that this strategy enables robust memory of multiple sequential tasks while reducing the number of edges and the overall tuning cost.

These families of states proliferate symmetrically toward the filling factor $ν= 1$, from both $ν= 2/3$ and $ν= 4/3$, thereby respecting particle-hole symmetry. Surprisingly, many unbalanced states (with unequal layer fillings) are more robust than their parent balanced states, defying the expected hierarchy of Jain sequences.

The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state.

In many examples of interacting quantum systems and random matrix models, this procedure is known to provide a reasonably accurate approximation to the exact numerical density of states. We review some of the examples that are known in the literature where this procedure works very well, and also discuss some of the limitations of this method in situations where the free probability approximation fails to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the exact density of states.

Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers.

Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed.

These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources."}

We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons. Hence we identify key challenges and find operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures."}

A sign-resolved decomposition separates the total negative weight from its phase-space distribution and defines a negative-channel Fisher information that quantifies how sensitively the negative lobe reshapes as a control parameter is varied.

In particular, the analogous operator response exists, that is, symmetry fractionalization. The fractionalization preserves the presence of the ASPT in the bulk, and the fractionalized edge operators acting on the edge bits of the ASPT. %analogous to the ones in the pure SPTs. In this work, based on the cluster model and by employing Choi mapping, we discuss generic features of the edge bits and numerically clarify the behavior of the edge bits and their robustness for varying decoherence and perturbative interactions. By using an operator-space mutual information (OSMI), we track the flow of quantum correlations between the two edges. Remarkably, even in the ASPT regime, a finite portion of the initial edge-to-edge correlation survives."}

Each input message is mapped to a weighted graph via a discrete random walk on an n X n toroidal grid, where the walk dynamics determine the edge weights. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is then used to extract the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Unlike standard QPE settings, the phase estimation is performed with respect to a superposition state (a uniform superposition over all node basis states) rather than an eigenvector, ensuring that all eigencomponents contribute to the resulting spectrum. This yields spectral features that distinguish even co-spectral but non-isomorphic message-induced graphs. The final spectral fingerprint is converted into a 256-bit digest, producing a compact representation of the input. As the fingerprint encodes both spectral and dynamical properties of the message-induced graph, the resulting hash exhibits strong sensitivity to input perturbations and provides a structurally rich foundation for post-quantum hashing. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we implement QGH-256 on a 4 X 4 toroidal grid, chosen empirically: smaller grids exhibit collisions, whereas larger grids significantly increase execution time. The entire pipeline is implemented in Qiskit, and we use a seeded statevector simulator to obtain stable, noise-free results."}

To circumvent this hardware demand, we introduce Energy-Scaled Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ES-ZNE), a quantum error mitigation protocol that uses the mean photon number of the GKP code as a tunable effective noise parameter. The protocol measures logical observables at a series of accessible finite energies and extrapolates the results to the ideal, infinite-energy limit using an ansatz based on the code's asymptotic error scaling. Through simulating a GKP qubit under a pure-loss channel, we demonstrate that ES-ZNE successfully mitigates finite-energy errors, recovering the ideal expectation values (within numerical uncertainty) in the shallow-noise regime. Furthermore, by computationally removing artifacts arising from the finite-energy encoding, our method characterizes the intrinsic performance of the ideal GKP code, revealing a sharp error threshold beyond which the code's corrective power diminishes. These results establish ES-ZNE as a practical, software-based strategy for enhancing the performance of near-term bosonic quantum processors, trading sampling overhead for demanding physical resources like high squeezing."}

In particular, we consider how such fan-out operations and qudits can be used to implement circuits which are challenging for distributed quantum computation, involving pairwise qubit interactions, i.e., what has been called global gates (a.k.a. global Mølmer-Sørensen gates). Such gates have been explored to possibly yield more efficient computations via reduced circuit depth, and can be carried out efficiently in some types of quantum hardware (e.g., trapped-ion quantum computers); we consider this as an exploration of an ``extreme'' case for distribution given the global qubit-qubit interactions.

Both analytical solutions and numerical simulations reveal that increasing nonreciprocity enhances directional energy transfer, enabling the target particle to reach a lower phonon occupation than is achievable in conventional cavity cooling.

Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to bridge this gap, but a practical camera-based vector magnetometry implementation on relevant microstructures has not been demonstrated. Here we adapt a commercial widefield microscope to implement a camera-compatible pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance protocol to reconstruct stray-field vectors from microscale devices. By resolving the Zeeman shifts of the four NV orientations, we reconstruct the stray-field vector generated by microfabricated permalloy structures that host multiple stable remanent states.

To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime. We lower bound the Reynolds number scaling of our quantum algorithm in dimension $D$ at Kolmogorov microscale resolution with $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{4}(1+\\frac{D}{2})} \\times q_M)$, where $q_M$ is a multiplicative overhead for data extraction with $q_M = O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{8}})$ for the drag force.

However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural \"parallelization\" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme.

In many examples of interacting quantum systems and random matrix models, this procedure is known to provide a reasonably accurate approximation to the exact numerical density of states. We review some of the examples that are known in the literature where this procedure works very well, and also discuss some of the limitations of this method in situations where the free probability approximation fails to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the exact density of states.

We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons.

Here we present an efficient framework to calculate the relation between the quantum states at the input and output of a nonlinear element in their respective relevant modes. Since the number of relevant input and output modes may differ, resulting in an open quantum system, we introduce the generalized Bloch-Messiah decomposition (GBMD), reducing the description to an equal number of input and output modes. The GBMD enables us to calculate the multimode Wigner function of the output state by convolving the rescaled Wigner function of the reduced input quantum pulse with a multivariate Gaussian phase-space function. We expand on this result by considering two examples input states: A Fock state in a single broadband mode and a two-mode squeezed vacuum, both in the THz-frequency regime, up-converted to a single output broadband mode of optical frequencies. We investigate the effect, the convolution and thermalization due to entanglement breakage have on the output Wigner function by calculating the von Neumann entropy of the output Wigner function. The methods presented here can be used to optimize the amplification or frequency conversion of broadband quantum states, opening an avenue to the generation and characterization of optical quantum states on ultrafast time scales."}

In this work, we study the detection of entanglement of polarized photons for measurement devices that are solely specified by rotational symmetry. We derive explicit positive operator valued measures (POVMs) showing that from a quantum information perspective any such setting is classified by one real measurable parameter r. In Particular, we give a POVM formulation of the Klein--Nishina formula for Compton scattering of polarized photons. We provide an SDP-based entanglement certification method that operates on the full measured statistics and gives tight bounds, also considering semi-device independent scenarios. Furthermore, we show that, while Bell violations are impossible with rotationally covariant measurements, EPR steering can still be certified under one-sided symmetry constraints. Finally, we present a rotationally covariant showcase experiment, analyzing the scattering of polarized optical light in a selection of soft drinks. Our results suggest that lemonade-based detectors are suitable for entanglement detection."}

However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems."}

We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness."}

The method uses a second oscillator as an effective environment and implements sudden quenches of the oscillator frequencies and coupling. Owing to the Gaussian nature of the dynamics, the thermalization condition reduces to three solvable equations, yielding exact analytic solutions for a dense discrete set of temperatures and numerical solutions in all other cases. Any target temperature can be approximated with arbitrary precision, with a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The simplicity of the protocol makes it a promising tool for rapid, controlled thermalization in quantum thermodynamics experiments and state preparation."}

Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures."}

Numerical simulations of the $1s$ exciton dynamics during intense circularly polarized pump pulses in two different Coulomb-interaction regimes are performed for two-dimensional semiconductors: Moderate Coulomb interaction is compared with dominating Coulomb interaction with respect to the light-matter interaction strength. The different many-body contributions are disentangled and it is found, that excitonic Rabi oscillations in the Coulomb-dominated regime are considerably less strong. By also comparing circular and linear excitation in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, it is found, that linear excitation creates a regime, where excitonic Rabi oscillations are almost completely suppressed."}

We simulate the quantum evolution of a mobile electron spin-qubit under the influence of sparse and singly charged point defects placed in the Si/SiGe heterostructure in close proximity to the shuttle lane.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.\n  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.\n  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point."}

Version to appear in Applied Physics A", "summary": "We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering."}
