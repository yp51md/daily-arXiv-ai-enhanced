### [1] [Relativistic electrodynamics with a universal length scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08872)
*Tiemo Pedergnana,Florian Kogelbauer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 从具有普适长度尺度的空间四阶Klein-Gordon方程推导出Dirac和Pauli方程的类似形式，并通过代数分解得到32维Dirac方程。实验验证通过Stern-Gerlach实验中的电子束分裂线进行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高阶Klein-Gordon方程与Dirac方程的关系，并验证修正电动力学框架下的粒子-反粒子不对称性和微观极化时空。

Method: 从Maxwell方程的奇异扰动变体出发，通过代数分解推导32维Dirac方程，并通过Stern-Gerlach实验验证理论。

Result: 观察到自旋算子的四个不同特征值，分为两对围绕经典值±ℏ/2，验证了修正电动力学框架的特性。

Conclusion: 理论成功解释了高阶Klein-Gordon方程与Dirac方程的联系，并展示了修正电动力学框架的独特性质。

Abstract: We derive the analogues of the Dirac and Pauli equations from a spatially
fourth-order Klein--Gordon equation with a universal length scale. Starting
from a singularly perturbed variant of Maxwell's equations, we deduce a
32-dimensional variant of the Dirac equation for spin-$1/2$ particles through
an algebraic factorization procedure. We illustrate an experimental test of the
theory from the split lines of the electron beam in a Stern--Gerlach
experiment. This hyperfine splitting leads to four distinct eigenvalues of the
spin operator, which can be grouped into two pairs centered around the classic
values of $\pm\hbar/2$. The modified electrodynamic framework features
particle-antiparticle asymmetry and an oriented, micropolar spacetime.

### [2] [Variational subspace methods and application to improving variational Monte Carlo dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08930)
*Adrien Kahn,Luca Gravina,Filippo Vicentini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种直接操作和优化子空间的形式化方法，避免在子空间方法中优化单个状态。通过行列式状态映射，将距离、能量和蒙特卡洛估计器等概念扩展到子空间，并改进了变分动力学的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要优化单个状态，效率较低。本文旨在通过直接操作子空间，简化优化过程并提高计算效率。

Method: 使用行列式状态映射将距离、能量和蒙特卡洛估计器扩展到子空间，并引入Bridge方法改进变分动力学。

Result: Bridge方法计算成本低，能显著减少动力学离散化带来的误差，可作为变分动力学的后处理工具。

Conclusion: 提出的形式化方法简化了子空间优化，Bridge方法有效提升了变分动力学的性能和实用性。

Abstract: We present a formalism that allows for the direct manipulation and
optimization of subspaces, circumventing the need to optimize individual states
when using subspace methods. Using the determinant state mapping, we can
naturally extend notions such as distance and energy to subspaces, as well as
Monte Carlo estimators, recovering the excited states estimation method
proposed by Pfau et al. As a practical application, we then introduce Bridge, a
method that improves the performance of variational dynamics by extracting
linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. We find that Bridge is
both computationally inexpensive and capable of significantly mitigating the
errors that arise from discretizing the dynamics, and can thus be
systematically used as a post-processing tool for variational dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量子计算中长距离门操作的效率问题，同时兼容现有超导量子计算架构。

Method: 利用平面结构，将量子比特分为数据和辅助两类，通过多体纠缠态和中间测量实现并行长距离门操作。

Result: 在n个数据与辅助量子比特的平面架构中，可同时执行O(√n)个长距离两比特门，仅需一轮最近邻门操作和中间测量。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于现有超导量子计算架构，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a quantum computation architecture based on geometries with
nearest-neighbor interactions, including e.g. planar structures. We show how to
efficiently split the role of qubits into data and entanglement-generation
qubits. Multipartite entangled states, e.g. 2D cluster states, are generated
among the latter, and flexibly transformed via mid-circuit measurements to
multiple, long-ranged Bell states, which are used to perform several two-qubit
gates in parallel on data qubits. We introduce planar architectures with $n$
data and $n$ auxiliary qubits that allow one to perform $O(\sqrt n)$
long-ranged two-qubit gates simultaneously, with only one round of nearest
neighbor gates and one round of mid-circuit measurements. We also show that our
approach is applicable in existing superconducting quantum computation
architectures, with only a constant overhead.

### [4] [Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08939)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文通过量子模拟研究了Kitaev蜂窝模型，展示了非阿贝尔相中的拓扑边缘动力学，并探讨了非可积相互作用对拓扑保护的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kitaev蜂窝模型是量子自旋液体的典型可解系统，但实际材料中的复杂相互作用阻碍了其实现，需要新的量子计算方法。

Method: 在离子阱量子处理器上模拟22位点Kitaev蜂窝模型，设计高效量子电路制备基态，并测量时间依赖的自旋关联。

Result: 在非阿贝尔相中观察到手性边缘动力学，符合拓扑序特征；非可积相互作用下，弱耦合保持手性，强耦合破坏拓扑保护。

Conclusion: 研究为利用可编程量子硬件探测拓扑序的动态特征提供了可行路径，为强关联材料的量子模拟开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a
quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge
modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However,
real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary
interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand
novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report
quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion
quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that
are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for
ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure
time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian
phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number
-- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the
Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg
model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics,
while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological
protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical
signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable
quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly
correlated materials.

TL;DR: 首次实现面心立方（FCC）晶格模型的量子算法用于蛋白质结构预测，展示了FCC晶格在建模蛋白质二级结构上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCC晶格比其他晶格更能准确模拟蛋白质的二级结构，这一点通过RMSD验证。

Method: 采用多项式拟合（PolyFit）和基于拉格朗日对偶原理的变分量子本征求解器（VQEC）两种量子方法。

Result: 在Eagle R3和Heron R2量子计算机上成功恢复6氨基酸序列KLVFFA的基态构型，Heron R2架构在预测和采样最优解上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 量子硬件进步（如Heron R2）对蛋白质结构预测应用有显著影响。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first implementation of the face-centered cubic
(FCC) lattice model for protein structure prediction with a quantum algorithm.
Our motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the
FCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures
in proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square
deviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a
polynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
with constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods
are successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2
(ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state
configurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative
analysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant
enhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a
three-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal
solution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture,
highlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于核电子轨道框架的量子计算算法，用于模拟质子转移动力学，并通过自适应近似量子编译方法在现有量子设备上实现高精度模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质子转移反应在化学和生物系统中至关重要，但经典方法难以准确捕捉量子效应（如隧穿、离域和零点运动）。

Method: 采用核电子轨道框架，结合冻结自然轨道近似构建初始ansätze，并通过自适应近似量子编译方法优化电路深度与保真度。

Result: 在IBM_FEZ设备上模拟质子转移路径，尽管噪声显著，但能量壁垒估计误差保持在13%以内。

Conclusion: 该方法为近量子设备和早期容错量子计算系统提供了一种实用的近似方案。

Abstract: Proton transfer reactions are fundamental to many chemical and biological
systems, where quantum effects such as tunneling, delocalization, and
zero-point motion play key kinetic control roles. However, classical methods
capable of accurately capturing these phenomena scale prohibitively with system
size. Here, we develop and demonstrate quantum computing algorithms based on
the Nuclear-Electronic Orbital framework, treating the transferring proton
quantum mechanically. We assess the potential of current quantum devices for
simulating proton transfer kinetics with high accuracy. We first construct a
deep initial ans\"atze within a truncated orbital space by employing the frozen
natural orbital approximation. Then, to balance circuit depth against state
fidelity, we implement an adaptive form of approximate quantum compiling. Using
resulting circuits at varying compression levels transpiled for the ibm_fez
device, we compute barrier heights and delocalised proton densities along the
proton transfer pathway using a realistic hardware noise model. We find that,
although current quantum hardware introduces significant noise relative to the
demanding energy tolerances involved, our approach allows substantial circuit
simplification while maintaining energy barrier estimates within 13% of the
reference value. Despite present hardware limitations, these results offer a
practical means of approximating key circuit segments in near-term devices and
early fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.

### [7] [Photon-Number-Resolving Detector Based on a Cascade of Waveguide-Coupled Quantum Emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09034)

Result: 提出的PNR探测器在现实条件下性能优于传统方案，有望成为下一代PNR探测器的候选方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为高性能PNR探测器提供了新思路，展示了其在非线性条件下的优越性能。

Abstract: We investigate the operation of a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector
consisting of a cascade of waveguide-coupled lambda-type emitters, where each
waveguide-coupled emitter extracts a single photon from the input light and
sends it to a single-photon detector. Using Green's function and input-output
formalisms, we derive the scattering matrices and photon-photon correlators for
individual scatterers. By cascading these results, we obtain a closed-form
expression for the detector's precision in the linear regime and predict how
correlations generated by nonlinear photon-photon interactions influence this
precision. To evaluate the performance of this PNR detector in the nonlinear
regime, we apply the quantum trajectory method to the cascaded setup,
calculating the achievable precision and analyzing its dependence on key system
parameters, such as the number of emitters and their coupling strength to the
waveguide. We compare the performance of the proposed PNR detector with that of
a conventional PNR scheme based on spatial demultiplexing via beamsplitters.
Our results indicate that the proposed scheme can outperform conventional
detectors under realistic conditions, making it a promising candidate for
next-generation PNR detection.

Abstract: We show, in the framework of a space-time resolved relativistic quantum eld
theory approach to tunneling, that microcausality precludes superluminal
tunneling dynamics. More specically in this work dealing with Dirac and
Klein-Gordon elds, we rst prove that microcausality holds for such elds in the
presence of a background potential. We then use this result to show that an
intervention performed on a localized region of an initial wave packet
subsequently scattering on a potential barrier does not result in any eect
outside the light cone emanating from that region. We illustrate these results
with numerical computations for Dirac fermions and Klein-Gordon bosons.

Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many
other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical
simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced
symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making
their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying
quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of
observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution
operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at
the level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently
constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using
short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it
to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a
transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively
permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales
polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large
system.

Conclusion: 挤压真空库显著影响时间晶体行为，为基于工程环境的时间晶体研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Nonequilibrium dissipative phase transition, arising from the competition of
cooperative behavior and coherent field driving, discovered in the 1970s by
Narducci et al. and Walls et al., has been found to exhibit time-crystal
behavior when the driving field exceeds the cooperative decay rate. This was
seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that
describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay
depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir
correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the
Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the
nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed
vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of
the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength
sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian
reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the
thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real
parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing
squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir
properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies
correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also
present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results
call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based
on engineered environments.

Conclusion: 研究为量子传感的时间分辨率提供了理论下限，并展示了量子速度极限在实际测量中的重要性。

Abstract: Temporal resolution is a critical figure of merit in quantum sensing. This
study combines the distinguishable condition of quantum states with quantum
speed limits to establish a lower bound on interrogation time. When the
interrogation time falls below this bound, the output state becomes
statistically indistinguishable from the input state, and the information will
inevitably be lost in noise. Without loss of generality, we extend these
conclusions to time-dependent signal Hamiltonian. In theory, leveraging certain
quantum control techniques allows us to calculate the minimum interrogation
time for arbitrary signal Hamiltonian. Finally, we illustrate the impact of
quantum speed limits on magnetic field measurements and temporal resolution.

Abstract: Quantum metrology experiments in atomic physics and quantum optics have
demonstrated measurement accuracy beyond the shot-noise limit via
multi-particle entanglement. At the same time, electron microscopy, an
essential tool for high-resolution imaging of biological systems, is severely
constrained in its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by shot noise, due to the dose
limit imposed by electron beam-induced damage. Here, we show theoretically that
spin squeezing, a form of quantum metrology based on entanglement, is a natural
fit for improving the SNR in electron microscopy. We investigate the generation
of the necessary entangled states through electron-electron Coulomb
interactions and quantum non-demolition measurements. Our results connect the
fields of quantum metrology and electron interferometry, paving the way toward
electron microscopy with SNR beyond the shot-noise limit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子退火过程中缺陷的形成和演化，以及KZ时间尺度在量子相变中的作用。

Method: 通过精确数值解（L≤6）分析量子退火过程中的缺陷动力学，并与经典模拟退火进行类比。

Result: 观察到KZ时间尺度（L^{z+1/ν}）和缺陷的动力学行为（L^2和L^3尺度），并发现不同缺陷类型的动态差异。

Conclusion: KZ时间尺度在量子退火中起主导作用，且可以通过特定方法检测L^3尺度的激发态行为。

Abstract: We investigate defects in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising
ferromagnet on periodic $L\times L$ lattices after quantum annealing from high
to vanishing field. With exact numerical solutions for $L \le 6$, we observe
the expected critical Kibble-Zurek (KZ) time scale $\propto L^{z+1/\nu}$ (with
$z=1$ and $1/\nu \approx 1.59$) at the quantum phase transition. We also
observe KZ scaling of the ground-state fidelity at the end of the process. The
excitations evolve by coarsening dynamics of confined defects, with a time
scale $\propto L^2$, and interface fluctuations of system-spanning defects,
with life time $\propto L^3$. We build on analogies with classical simulated
annealing, where we characterize system-spanning defects in detail and find
differences in the dynamic scales of domain walls with winding numbers
$W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ (horizontal/vertical) and $W=(1,1)$ (diagonal). They decay on
time scales $\propto L^3$ (which applies also to system-spanning domains in
systems with open boundaries) and $\propto L^{3.4}$, respectively, when imposed
in the ordered phase. As a consequence of $L^{3.4}$ exceeding the classical KZ
scale $L^{z+1/\nu}=L^{3.17}$ the probability of $W=(1,1)$ domains in SA scales
with the KZ exponent even in the final $T=0$ state. In QA, also the
$W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ domains are controlled by the KZ time scale $L^{2.59}$. The
$L^3$ scale can nevertheless be detected in the excited states, using a method
that we develop that should also be applicable in QA experiments.

Abstract: Superposition is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. From the
Schrodinger's cat to quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jorsza algorithm,
quantum superposition plays an important role. It is one fundamental and
crucial question how to quantify superposition. Until now, the framework of
coherence has been well established as one typical instance of quantum resource
theories. And the concept of coherence has been generalized into linearly
independent basis, projective measurements and POVMs. In this work, we will
focus on coherence measures for projective measurements or orthogonal
subspaces. One new condition, order-preserving condition, is proposed for such
measures. This condition is rooted in the mathematical structure of Hilbert
spaces' orthogonal decomposition. And by generalizing the 1/2-affinity of
coherence into subspace cases, we verify that this generalized coherence
measure satisfies the order-preserving condition. And it also satisfies other
reasonable conditions to be a good coherence measure. As the partial order
relationship exists for not only projective measurements, but also POVMs, it's
natural to study the order-preserving condition in POVM cases, which will be
the last part of this work.

Result: 数值结果未显示APS猜想被违反的证据。

Conclusion: 当前结果支持APS猜想的有效性，但需进一步研究验证。

Abstract: The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be
upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight
fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture
that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight
matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular
graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of
regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of
the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional
Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional
matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm
to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as
possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision
tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show
any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.

Result: 实现了18 dB增益、400 MHz带宽（中心频率5.3 GHz）和-114 dBm饱和功率的近量子极限放大。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了宽带JPA的制造，并为新型JPA操作模式提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We present the experimental demonstration of an impedance-engineered
Josephson parametric amplifier (IEJPA) fabricated in a single-step lithography
process. Impedance engineering is implemented using a lumped-element series LC
circuit. We use a simpler lithography process where the entire device --
impedance transformer and JPA -- are patterned in a single electron beam
lithography step, followed by a double-angle Dolan bridge technique for
Al-AlO$_x$-Al deposition. We observe nearly quantum-limited amplification with
18 dB gain over a wide 400 MHz bandwidth centered around 5.3 GHz, and a
saturation power of -114 dBm. To accurately explain our experimental results,
we extend existing theories for impedance-engineered JPAs to incorporate the
full sine nonlinearity of both the JPA and the transformer. Our work shows a
path to simpler realization of broadband JPAs and provides a theoretical
foundation for a novel regime of JPA operation.

Motivation: 为量子多体系统提供热力学一致的描述，解决传统方法在能级间距消失系统中的失效问题。

Method: 推导热力学一致的量子主方程，不依赖传统的不适用于能级间距消失系统的secular近似。

Result: 准局域Redfield方程与Davies方程完全一致，且不依赖secular近似。

Conclusion: 该结果为量子多体系统的热力学一致描述奠定了基础，并可推广到缓慢驱动的二次系统和一般量子多体系统。

Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent quantum master equation that
satisfies locality for quadratic systems coupled to independent and identical
baths at each site. We show that the quasi-local Redfield equation coincides
exactly with the Davies equation, which satisfies the detailed-balance
condition, due to cancellation of quantum coherence generated by each bath.
This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in
systems with vanishing energy-level spacings. We discuss generalizations of our
result to slowly driven quadratic systems and generic quantum many-body
systems. Our result paves the way to a thermodynamically consistent description
of quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We present an ultrastrong superinductor-based coupling consisting of a flux
qubit galvanically coupled to a resonator. The coupling inductor is fabricated
in granular Aluminum, a superinductor material able to provide large surface
inductances. Spectroscopy measurements on the qubit-resonator system reveal a
Bloch-Siegert shift of \SI{23}{\mega\hertz} and a coupling fraction of
$g/\omega_r \simeq 0.13$, entering the perturbative ultrastrong coupling (USC)
regime. We estimate the inductance of the coupler independently by
low-temperature resistance measurements providing $L_c =
(0.74\pm0.14)\,\mathrm{nH}$, which is compatible with $g/\omega \gtrsim 0.1$.
Our results show that superinductors are a promising tool to study USC physics

Abstract: Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy
content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of
quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context.
The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the
system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a
classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of
interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into
account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and
cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.

Result: 发现了一组与任意量子i.i.d.态对易的算子，并证明满足充分条件的系统具有量子i.i.d.稳态。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅识别了一类具有精确可解稳态的模型，还提出了一个禁止量子纠缠和空间关联的“不可行”定理。

Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a
nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for
exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general
equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or
dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum
i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with
arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states
is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems
that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class
of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem
that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class
of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.

Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of tripartite stabilizer states on $N$
qudits of dimension $D$, distributed across parties $A$, $B$, and $C$, under
arbitrary local unitaries. Prior work by Bravyi et al. and Looi et al. showed
that qubit and squarefree qudit stabilizer states can be transformed via local
Clifford unitaries into tensor products of GHZ states, EPR pairs, and
unentangled qudits [arXiv:quant-ph/0504208, arXiv:1107.1761]. We generalize
this to arbitrary integer $D$ by introducing local unitaries beyond the
Clifford group, enabling decomposition of prime-power qudit stabilizer states
into $p$-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits. Our algorithm
leverages subsystem phase matrices to characterize entanglement and applies to
quantum protocols requiring efficient entanglement distribution.

Conclusion: 量子比特-振荡器耦合强度是调控热传输和整流效应的关键因素，为热管理器件设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at
different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular,
the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an
inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to
the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a
circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of
current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling.
While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the
sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique,
highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the
detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the
nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the
current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the
rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or
negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the
current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect
to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate
formulas.

Abstract: Quantum computers may one day enable the efficient simulation of
strongly-coupled plasmas that lie beyond the reach of classical computation in
regimes where quantum effects are important and the scale separation is large.
In this letter, we take the first step towards efficient simulation of quantum
plasmas by demonstrating linear plasma wave propagation on a superconducting
quantum chip. Using high-fidelity and highly expressive device-native gates,
combined with a novel error mitigation technique, we simulate the scattering of
laser pulses from inhomogeneous plasmas. Our approach is made feasible by the
identification of a suitable local spin model whose excitations mimic plasma
waves, whose circuit implementation requires a lower gate count than other
proposed approaches that would require a future fault-tolerant quantum
computer. This work opens avenues to study more complicated phenomena that
cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers, such as nonlinear
quantum dynamics when strongly-coupled plasmas are driven out of equilibrium.

Abstract: Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum technology, playing a key role in
quantum computing, cryptography, and information processing. Conventional
methods for generating entanglement via optical setups rely on beam splitters,
nonlinear media, or quantum dots, which often require bulky configurations and
precise phase control. In contrast, metasurfaces - ultrathin, engineered
optical interfaces - offer a compact and tunable alternative for quantum
photonics. In this work, we demonstrate that metasurfaces can serve as a
promising platform for generating Bell states through a Hamiltonian-driven
spin-entanglement mechanism. By analyzing the system's evolution under a
metasurface interaction Hamiltonian, we show that an initially separable spin
state evolves into a maximally entangled Bell state. We further study classical
and quantum correlations, evaluate the impact of environmental decoherence, and
compute quantum discord to quantify correlation robustness beyond entanglement.
Our analysis shows that metasurfaces can generate Bell states with a
concurrence of about 0.995 and maintain quantum discord for up to 29
microseconds. These results establish metasurfaces as scalable, high-fidelity
components for next-generation quantum photonic architectures.

Abstract: We study classical and quantum echoes in a Kerr oscillator driven by a
frequency-controlling pulsed perturbation. We consider dynamical response to
the perturbation for a single coherent state and for Schr\"odinger cat states
constructed as both balanced and imbalanced superpositions of two coherent
states. For individual coherent states, we demonstrate that a weak parametric
drive yields a long-lived sequence of classical echoes. Cat states are found to
exhibit distinct quantum echoes that are sensitive to the initial relative
phase and weights of the coherent states in superposition. We examine the
effect of dissipation on quantum echoes and quantum revivals of cat states. We
demonstrate that, even when dissipation suppresses quantum revivals, quantum
echoes can be recovered by properly tuning the timing and strength of the
perturbation. These results may be useful for characterizing and mitigating
errors of cat qubits.

Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct
Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$
even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $
\altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random
population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When
$\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real
symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the
spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$
the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these
real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the
diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are
pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta
\altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group.
These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time
(PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.

Abstract: A set of new schemes for quantum computation and communication have been
either designed or experimentally realized using optimal quantum resources. A
multi-output quantum teleportation scheme, where a sender (Alice) teleports an
m and m+1-qubit GHZ-like unknown state to a receiver (Bob), has been
demonstrated using two copies of the Bell state instead of a five-qubit cluster
state and implemented on IBM's quantum computer for the m=1 case. Another
scheme, known as quantum broadcasting where a known state is sent to two
spatially separated parties (Bob and Charlie) has also been realized using two
Bell states. It is shown that existing quantum broadcasting schemes can be
reduced to multiparty remote state preparation. After achieving teleportation
of unknown and known states, sending a quantum operator becomes the next step.
A scheme for remote implementation of operators (RIO), specifically a
controlled joint-RIO (CJRIO), has been proposed using a four-qubit
hyper-entangled state involving spatial and polarization degrees of freedom. In
this direction, two more variants, remote implementation of hidden and
partially unknown operators (RIHO and RIPUO) have also been proposed. Their
success probabilities are analyzed considering dissipation of an auxiliary
coherent state interacting with the environment. For secure multiparty tasks
like quantum voting or auction, secure multiparty quantum computation (SMQC)
becomes essential. A quantum anonymous voting (QAV) scheme has been
experimentally implemented on IBM's quantum computer. Finally, two quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocols, coherent one-way (COW) and differential phase
shift (DPS), are experimentally demonstrated and the key rates are analyzed as
functions of post-processing parameters and detector dead times across various
distances.

Conclusion: Ensemble-IR为量子系统开发提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Emerging quantum applications such as error mitigation, system
characterization, and hybrid protocols often require running large families of
related quantum circuits. Existing intermediate representations (IRs) and
frameworks such as Qiskit, QIR, MitiQ, and OpenQASM do not provide primitives
to concisely express such workloads. These tools instead rely on explicit
enumeration of the unique circuits within each workload. We introduce
Ensemble-IR, an intermediate representation designed to concisely express these
ensemble workloads. Rather than enumerating each circuit separately,
Ensemble-IR encodes an entire workload through a rich, shared unified program.
This program specifies common circuit structure along with symbolic operations
to express points of variation - such as gate types, gate placement, parameter
values, or qubit configurations. Ensemble-IR enables quantum systems to load an
entire family of circuits onto a device as a single concise file, allowing
contained circuits to instead be recreated on-the-fly at runtime. We
demonstrate Ensemble-IR across 18 real-world workloads from prior literature,
highlighting its widespread utility for scalable quantum system development.

Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for enhancing entanglement, achieving
asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and creating nonreciprocal
quantum correlations within a hybrid system. This system integrates a yttrium
iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which exhibits magnon-phonon coupling via
magnetostriction, with a silica sphere featuring optomechanical
whispering-gallery modes. By tuning the Barnett effect through the magnetic
field direction, our system enables controllable asymmetric EPR steering and
nonreciprocal entanglement between both directly and indirectly coupled modes.
We demonstrate that adjusting the reflectivity of a beam splitter can boost
stationary quantum steering and entanglement, effectively countering thermal
noise. This approach allows for the generation of multipartite entanglement and
both one-way and two-way steering. The proposed system is experimentally
feasible and holds significant promise for various quantum information
applications.

Result: 无噪声时，QFI和WYSI单调增加；有噪声时，两者呈指数衰减，且最大淬火时间与噪声方差线性相关。

Conclusion: 噪声显著改变了量子相干性的动力学行为，与量子退火中的缺陷最小化行为一致。

Abstract: We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising
model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin
correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and
Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the
absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase
monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits
without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When
noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change
dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp
quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the
maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum,
scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that
determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy
quantum annealing.

Conclusion: QCNN在高通量虚拟筛选中具有可行性和噪声容忍性，为加速药物发现提供了新思路。

Abstract: Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a key computational strategy for
identifying potential drug candidates by estimating the binding free energies
(delta G_bind) of protein-ligand complexes. The immense size of chemical
libraries, combined with the need to account for protein and ligand
conformations as well as ligand translations and rotations, makes these tasks
computationally intensive on classical hardware. This study proposes a quantum
convolutional neural network (QCNN) framework to estimate delta G_bind
efficiently. Using the PDBbind v2020 dataset, we trained QCNN models with 9 and
12 qubits, with the core set designated as the test set. The best-performing
model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.694 on the test set. To
assess robustness, we introduced quantum noise under two configurations. While
noise increased the root mean square deviation, the Pearson correlation
coefficient remained largely stable. These results demonstrate the feasibility
and noise tolerance of QCNNs for high-throughput virtual screening and
highlight the potential of quantum computing to accelerate drug discovery.

logical gate $\sqrt{H}_L$ for square GKP codes. This gate does not directly
involve an auxiliary qubit and is compatible with finite energy constraints on
the code. Fidelity can be further enhanced using the small-Big-small (SBS)
error correction protocol and post-selection, making the scheme robust against
a single photon loss event. We finally propose a circuit QED implementation to
operate the Kerr interaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量子奇异值变换（QSVT）的量子算法，用于求解线性方程组，并在模拟中实现了高保真度的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子算法在求解线性方程组中的应用潜力，特别是在模拟器中实现高精度解的可能性。

Method: 使用QSVT和21次多项式逼近逆函数，通过块编码和经典优化相位角，构建浅层量子电路。

Result: 在模拟中实现了99.9%以上的解保真度，但硬件实现受限。

Conclusion: QSVT算法在模拟器中表现优异，但需开发更高效的测量方法以适应近量子设备。

Abstract: This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of
equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial
x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value
Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an
21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$,
enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including
two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles
for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad
gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This
approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of
Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial
condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more
than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results
demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full
quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face
challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This
limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$
observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current
limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems
of equations, and they point to the need for the development of
measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that quantum error correction is essential for
realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent experiments have
demonstrated error correction codes operating below threshold, primarily using
local planar codes such as the surface code and color code. In parallel,
theoretical advances in quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes promise
significantly lower overheads, albeit at the cost of requiring non-local parity
checks. While these results are encouraging, implementing such codes remains
challenging for near-term experiments, creating obstacles to holistic
benchmarking of hardware architectures capable of supporting long-range
couplers. In this work, we present a simple construction recipe for small
quantum LDPC codes based on recent developments in the field. Our codes are
approximately twice as efficient as comparable surface codes, yet require only
weight-four parity checks, which simplifies experimental realization compared
to other quantum LDPC codes. We provide concrete proposals for implementations
with superconducting qubits in flip-chip architectures and with semiconductor
spin qubits using shuttling-based approaches.

TL;DR: 非线性方法克服了线性EPs在传感应用中的噪声放大问题，通过耦合非线性Van der Pol振荡器，实现了17倍的信噪比提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决线性EPs在传感应用中因噪声放大而限制信噪比提升的问题。

Method: 耦合金刚石量子传感器与非线性Van der Pol振荡器，形成自振荡混合系统，利用双稳态过渡点（BP）的特性。

Result: 在BP附近进行NV磁力测量，信噪比提升17倍，达到170 fT/√Hz的灵敏度。

Conclusion: 非线性方法显著提升了量子传感性能，解决了EPs在传感中的长期争议。

Abstract: Phase transitions can dramatically alter system dynamics, unlocking new
behavior and improving performance. Exceptional points (EPs), where the
eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a coupled linear system coalesce,
are particularly relevant for sensing applications as they can increase sensor
response to external perturbations to a range of phenomena from optical phase
shifts to gravitational waves. However, the coalescence of eigenstates at
linear EPs amplifies noise, negating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
enhancement. Here, we overcome this limitation using nonlinearity, which
exhibits exceptional SNR around a bistable transition point (BP). We couple a
state-of-the-art diamond quantum sensor to a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator,
forming a self-oscillating hybrid system that exhibits both a single-valued and
bistable phase. The boundaries between these phases are marked by both
adiabatic and deterministic non-adiabatic transitions that enable chiral state
switching and state coalescence at the BP. Crucially, NV magnetometry performed
near the BP exhibits a 17x enhancement in SNR, achieving a record sensitivity
of 170 fT/\sqrt{Hz}. This result surpasses the sensitivity limit of an ideal,
thermally-limited electron magnetometer and resolves a long-standing debate
regarding EP-like physics in advanced quantum sensing.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated immense potential in
synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity images. However, critical questions
remain unanswered regarding how quantum principles might best enhance their
representational and computational capacity. In this paper, we investigate
hybrid quantum-classical GAN architectures supplemented by transfer learning to
systematically examine whether incorporating Variational Quantum Circuits
(VQCs) into the generator, the discriminator, or both improves performance over
a fully classical baseline. Our findings indicate that fully hybrid models,
which incorporate VQCs in both the generator and the discriminator,
consistently produce images of higher visual quality and achieve more favorable
quantitative metrics compared to their fully classical counterparts. In
particular, VQCs in the generator accelerate early feature learning, whereas
those in the discriminator, despite exhibiting slower initial convergence,
ultimately facilitate more refined synthetic outputs. Moreover, the model
sustains near-comparable performance even when the dataset size is drastically
reduced, suggesting that transfer learning and quantum enhancements mitigate
the problem of data scarcity. Overall, the results underscore that carefully
integrating quantum computing with classical adversarial training and
pretrained feature extraction can considerably enrich GAN-based image
synthesis. These insights open avenues for future work on higher-resolution
tasks, alternative quantum circuit designs, and experimentation with emerging
quantum hardware.

Abstract: Decoherence due to radiative decay remains an important consideration in
scaling superconducting quantum processors. We introduce a passive,
interference-based methodology for suppressing radiative decay using only the
intrinsic multi-mode structured environment of superconducting circuits. By
taking into account the full electromagnetic mode-mode couplings within the
device, we derive analytic conditions that enable destructive interference.
These conditions are realized by introducing controlled geometric asymmetries
-- such as localized perturbations to the transmon capacitor -- which increase
mode hybridization and activate interference between multiple decay pathways.
We validate this methodology using perturbation theory, full-wave
electromagnetic simulations, and experimental measurements of a symmetry-broken
transmon qubit with improved coherence times.

Conclusion: 该研究为弱测量在量子信息中的应用提供了新视角，特别是在状态检测和相位推断方面。

Abstract: We investigate the sequential composition of weak values in the framework of
time-symmetric quantum mechanics. Specifically, we consider a forward'' weak
measurement from a preselected state $\ket{\psi}$ to a post-selected state
$\ket{\phi}$, followed by a reverse'' weak measurement. We show that the
product of these two weak values corresponds to the normalized expectation
value of a strong, state-conditioned observable $B = A P_\psi A$, where $P_\psi
= \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the projector onto the preselected state. Analyzing
the structure of $B$, we demonstrate how it encodes interference information,
particularly when $\ket{\psi}$ is a superposition rather than an eigenstate of
$A$. This formulation extends naturally to mixed states by replacing $P_\psi$
with a generic density matrix $\rho$, linking the construction to the formalism
of generalized quantum measurements. We illustrate practical applications in
quantum information, including state-specific error witnessing in quantum
computing, and show how the phase of a weak value can be inferred via strong
measurements in the pure-state case.

Abstract: Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an essential step for
implementing quantum algorithms. For qubit-based devices, where native gates
are typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition
techniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for
decomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in
account. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing,
we develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we
introduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor
product of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into
single- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries
generated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices).
Since both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with
identity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result
also to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit
rotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the
layers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based
implementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited
to qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach
yields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based
implementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also
requiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the
routing challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited
connectivity of the devices. In particular, we generalize the Steiner-Gauss
method, originally developed to reduce CNOT counts in qubit circuit, to
optimize gate routing in qutrit-based systems.

Conclusion: 量子算法在LQG问题上实现了渐进量子加速，适用于高维系统。

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving the finite-horizon discrete-time
Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem, which integrates optimal
control and state estimation in the presence of stochastic disturbances and
noise. Classical approaches to LQG require solving a backward Riccati recursion
and a forward Kalman filter, both requiring computationally expensive matrix
operations with overall time complexity $\mathcal{O}(T n^3)$, where $n$ is the
system dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. While efficient classical solvers
exist, especially for small to medium-sized systems, their computational
complexity grows rapidly with system dimension. To address this, we reformulate
the full LQG pipeline using quantum linear algebra primitives, including
block-encoded matrix representations and quantum singular value transformation
(QSVT) techniques for matrix inversion and multiplication. We formally analyze
the time complexity of each algorithmic component. Under standard assumptions
on matrix condition numbers and encoding precision, the total runtime of the
quantum LQG algorithm scales polylogarithmically with the system dimension $n$
and linearly with the time horizon $T$, offering an asymptotic quantum speedup
over classical methods.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its
efficient and high-fidelity generation remains a challenge due to the
complexity of quantum dynamics. This paper presents a quantum optimal control
framework to maximize bipartite entanglement within a fixed time horizon, under
bounded control inputs. By leveraging Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, we derive
a set of necessary conditions that guide the design of time-dependent control
fields to steer a two-qubit system toward maximally entangled Bell states. The
entanglement is quantified using concurrence, and the control objective is
formulated as maximizing this measure at the terminal time. Our approach is
validated through numerical simulations of Liouville-von Neumann dynamics. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of switching-based control strategies in
achieving robust entanglement, offering insights into practical implementations
of quantum control for entanglement generation in quantum networks.

Abstract: We evaluated a multi-color two-photon entangled state generated in silicon
via spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) as a potential source for bosonic
integrated circuits. Spatially entangled photon states were created using a
pair of silicon waveguides that produced signal and idler photons through SFWM,
allowing us to observe quantum interference between them. Assuming that the
frequencies of the multi-color photons were nearly identical, we characterized
the generated quantum state by performing quantum state tomography on the
bosonic system using a linear optical circuit. This study demonstrates the
feasibility of using photon-pair sources generated in silicon via SFWM in
bosonic optical circuits and highlights their potential for a wide range of
applications in silicon-based optical quantum technologies.

Abstract: Paramount for performances of quantum network applications are the structure
and quality of distributed entanglement. Here we propose a scalable and
efficient approach to reveal the topological information of unknown quantum
networks, and quantify entanglement simultaneously. The scheme exploits
entropic uncertainty, an operationally meaningful measure of correlation, by
performing only two local measurements on each qubit. Moreover, when
measurement outcomes in each node are collectively evaluated, integrating
uncertainty and mutual information enables a direct count of the number of
bipartite sources between any two nodes. This surpasses what is possible via
applying either approach solely. Moreover, quantum error mitigation techniques
including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and virtual distillation (VD),
which have been widely applied to suppress biases in single expectation value,
are further incorporated to mitigate errors in entropic quantities. We find
that PEC successfully removes deviations in correlation estimations. Meanwhile,
VD extends the depolarizing noise strength that allows for valid bipartite
entanglement certification from 8.8% to 26.4%, thus substantially enhancing
robustness against bias-inducing noise in practical situations. The proposal is
applicable to a broad variety of platforms and helps to spur future studies
toward harnessing the advantages of quantum networks.

Abstract: A microwave-optical transducer of sufficiently low noise and high signal

opto-electromechanical transducer with high signal throughput, as quantified by
an efficiency-bandwidth-duty-cycle product of 7 kHz, approaching
quantum-enabled operation in upconversion as well as downconversion, with
input-referred added noise of 3 photons. In downconversion, throughput of this
magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum
channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which
quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of
improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible
improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions
membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a

as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep
neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient
measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied
to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear
properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography
tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by
our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice.
Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend
measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk
properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have
independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without
having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.

Motivation: 量子波函数的本体论地位是量子理论中最具争议的问题之一，本文旨在探讨认知解释和本体解释的优劣。

Method: 通过分析不确定性原理的普遍性和精确性，比较认知解释和本体解释的适用性，并从希尔伯特空间的数学结构推导量子不确定性。

Result: 认知解释在解释不确定性原理时存在不足，而本体解释能更一致且自然地解释量子不确定性。

Conclusion: 本体解释比认知解释更能解释量子力学中的核心特征，如不确定性原理。

Abstract: The ontological status of the quantum wavefunction remains one of the most
debated questions in quantum theory. While epistemic interpretations regard the
wavefunction as a reflection of our knowledge or beliefs, ontic interpretations
treat it as a real physical object. In this paper, we argue that epistemic
approaches struggle to explain the universality and precision of the
uncertainty principle, a core feature of quantum mechanics. By contrast,
treating the wave-function as ontic allows a consistent and natural derivation
of quantum uncertainty from the mathematical structure of Hilbert space. We
examine key interpretations on both sides and highlight why the epistemic view
falls short in addressing constraints that appear to be intrinsic to nature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于路由贝尔测试的设备无关私有量子随机信标（DIPQRB），显著降低了设备要求，使不可信设备生成随机数更实用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统设备无关量子随机数生成（DIQRNG）协议设备要求严格，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过路由贝尔测试，将设备需求分布在服务器和客户端网络中，服务器使用高性能设备，客户端使用低成本设备。

Result: DIPQRB提供了一种经济高效的方法，从不可信设备生成安全且私密的随机数。

Conclusion: DIPQRB为不可信设备生成安全随机数提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) is the gold
standard for generating truly random numbers, as it can produce certifiably
random numbers from untrusted devices. However, the stringent device
requirements of traditional DIQRNG protocols have limited their practical
applications. Here, we introduce Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness
Beacon (DIPQRB), a novel approach to generate random numbers from untrusted
devices based on routed Bell tests. This method significantly relaxes the
device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness
from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a
network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate
high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more
cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also
private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic
applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate
secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.

Conclusion: 量子力学解释偏好在过去几十年中相对稳定。

Abstract: As we approach the centennial anniversary of modern quantum mechanics this
paper revisits the foundational debates through a new poll within the research
community. Inspired by the survey by Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger at the
specialized 2011 Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality conference, we
expanded our recruitment to include a more representative sample of the broader
community of physicists with the aim to reveal potential shifts in scientists'
views and compare our findings with those from several previous polls. While
quantum foundations still lack a consensus interpretation, our results indicate
a persistent preference for the Copenhagen interpretation. This enduring
support likely reflects both the educational emphasis on the Copenhagen
interpretation and its pragmatic appeal in avoiding complex metaphysical
questions and introducing new notions (e.g., other worlds or the pilot wave).
Our findings thus underscore the relative stability of interpretational
preferences over the past decades.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for indiscernibility of
quantum states, arguing that, given a set of observables, the ``distinguishable
objects'' are the equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to the
observables. The structure of the set of distinguishable objects - called the
Holevo space - is investigated in detail, and it is shown that the observables
admit a natural lift to continuous functions on the Holevo space. The theory is
illustrated by several examples where the ``distinguishable objects'' can be
described explicitly. Among other things, the Holevo spaces and the lifted
functions are described for position measurements on a free particle and for
spin measurements in the EPR and Bell experiments.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of how quantum circuit design, specifically the
depth of the variational ansatz and the choice of quantum feature mapping,
affects the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on a causal
classification task. The architecture combines a convolutional neural network
for classical feature extraction with a parameterized quantum circuit acting as
the quantum layer. We evaluate multiple ansatz depths and nine different
feature maps. Results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions
improves generalization and training stability, though benefits tend to plateau
beyond a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is even more critical:
only encodings with multi-axis Pauli rotations enable successful learning,
while simpler maps lead to underfitting or loss of class separability.
Principal Component Analysis and silhouette scores reveal how data
distributions evolve across network stages. These findings offer practical
guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models. All source codes and
evaluation tools are publicly available.

Conclusion: 该协议为未来仲裁量子签名协议的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum digital signatures ensure unforgeable message authenticity and
integrity using quantum principles, offering unconditional security against
both classical and quantum attacks. They are crucial for secure communication
in high-stakes environments, ensuring trust and long-term protection in the
quantum era. Nowadays, the majority of arbitrated quantum signature (AQS)
protocols encrypt data qubit by qubit using the quantum one-time pad (QOTP).
Despite providing robust data encryption, QOTP is not a good fit for AQS
because of its susceptibility to many types of attacks. In this work, we
present an efficient AQS protocol to encrypt quantum message ensembles using a
distinct encryption technique, the chained controlled unitary operations. In
contrast to existing protocols, our approach successfully prevents disavowal
and forgery attacks. We hope this contributes to advancing future
investigations into the development of AQS protocols.

Abstract: The tunneling effect driven by waveform-controlled laser pulses is a
cornerstone of attosecond science and contributes decisively to its extreme
time resolution. In the spatial domain, electron tunneling through a
bias-driven junction between a nanotip and a surface enables atomic-scale
spatial resolution in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Recently, first
signatures of attosecond modulation of STM currents have shown that
simultaneous attosecond-nanometer resolution is feasible. However, while
sub-cycle attosecond dynamics are routinely controlled and determined with high
precision, controlling the direction of the currents and determining their
duration have remained elusive in STM. Here, we induce STM tunneling currents
using two-color laser pulses and dynamically control their direction, relying
solely on the sub-cycle waveform of the pulses. Projecting our measurement data
onto numerical and analytical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation reveals non-adiabatic tunneling as the underlying physical mechanism,
yielding current burst durations on the order of 900 as. Despite working under
ambient conditions but free from thermal artifacts, we achieve a lateral
spatial resolution of 2 nm and sub-angstr\"om topographic sensitivity.
Directional control of attosecond bursts in STM will enable triggering and
detecting ultrafast charge dynamics in molecular systems and defect states at
the spatio-temporal frontier of microscopy.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states are essential resources in quantum information

non-Gaussianity in many-body systems. Building on recent theoretical insights
into the self-convolution properties of bosonic pure states, we introduce
non-Gaussian entropy as a new measure to characterize non-Gaussianity in
bosonic pure states. We further propose a practical protocol for measuring
non-Gaussian entropy using three beam splitters and four copies of the input
state. In addition, we extend this framework to mixed states, providing a
general approach to quantifying non-Gaussianity. Our results offer a convenient
and efficient method for characterizing bosonic non-Gaussianity, paving the way
for its implementation on near-term experimental platforms.

Abstract: Quantum speed-ups for dynamical simulation usually demand unitary
time-evolution, whereas the large ODE/PDE systems encountered in realistic
physical models are generically non-unitary. We present a universal
moment-fulfilling dilation that embeds any linear, non-Hermitian flow $\dot x =
A x$ with $A=-iH+K$ into a strictly unitary evolution on an enlarged Hilbert
space: \[
  ( (l| \otimes I )
  \mathcal T e^{-i \int ( I_A\otimes H +i F\otimes K) dt}
  ( |r) \otimes I )
  = \mathcal T e^{\int A dt}, \] provided the triple $( F, (l|, |r) )$
satisfies the compact moment identities $(l| F^{k}|r) =1$ for all $k\ge 0$ in
the ancilla space. This algebraic criterion recovers both
\emph{Schr\"odingerization} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 230602 (2024)] and the
linear-combination-of-Hamiltonians (LCHS) scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603
(2023)], while also unveiling whole families of new dilations built from
differential, integral, pseudo-differential, and difference generators. Each
family comes with a continuous tuning parameter \emph{and} is closed under
similarity transformations that leave the moments invariant, giving rise to an
overwhelming landscape of design space that allows quantum dilations to be
co-optimized for specific applications, algorithms, and hardware.
  As concrete demonstrations, we prove that a simple finite-difference dilation
in a finite interval attains near-optimal oracle complexity. Numerical
experiments on Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation confirm the accuracy and
robustness of the approach.

Abstract: Excited states play a central role in determining the physical properties of
quantum matter, yet their accurate computation in many-body systems remains a
formidable challenge for numerical methods. While neural quantum states have
delivered outstanding results for ground-state problems, extending their
applicability to excited states has faced limitations, including instability in
dense spectra and reliance on symmetry constraints or penalty-based
formulations. In this work, we rigorously formalize the framework introduced by
Pfau et al.~\cite{pfau2024accurate} in terms of Grassmann geometry of the
Hilbert space. This allows us to generalize the Stochastic Reconfiguration
method for the simultaneous optimization of multiple variational wave
functions, and to introduce the multidimensional versions of operator variances
and overlaps. We validate our approach on the Heisenberg quantum spin model on
the square lattice, achieving highly accurate energies and physical observables
for a large number of excited states.

Abstract: We present a method to suppress crosstalk from implementing controlled-Z
gates via local addressing in neutral atom quantum computers. In these systems,
a fraction of the laser light that is applied locally to implement gates
typically leaks to other atoms. We analyze the resulting crosstalk in a setup
of two gate atoms and one neighboring third atom. We then perturbatively derive
a spin-echo-inspired gate protocol that suppresses the leading order of the
amplitude error, which dominates the crosstalk. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that our gate protocol improves the fidelity by two orders of
magnitude across a broad range of experimentally relevant parameters. To
further reduce the infidelity, we develop a circuit to cancel remaining phase
errors. Our results pave the way for using local addressing for high-fidelity
quantum gates on Rydberg-based quantum computers.

Conclusion: 该模型适用于量子密钥分发、TCSPC、LIDAR等领域，并可推广至其他死时间限制的探测器。

Abstract: Current count-rate models for single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs)
typically assume an instantaneous recovery of the quantum efficiency following
dead-time, leading to a systematic overestimation of the effective detection
efficiency for high photon flux. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
generalized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the
non-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following
dead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the
exponential-recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately
predicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming
the conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the
impinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the
model to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model
simplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum
efficiency $\eta_0$, dead-time $\tau_\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant
$\tau_\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be
achieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally
gated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key
distribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and
related areas. Furthermore, the model is readily adaptable to other types of
dead-time-limited detectors. A Python implementation is provided as
supplementary material for swift adoption.

Abstract: Classical Shadow Tomography (Huang, Kueng and Preskill, Nature Physics 2020)
is a method for creating a classical snapshot of an unknown quantum state,
which can later be used to predict the value of an a-priori unknown observable
on that state. In the short time since their introduction, classical shadows
received a lot of attention from the physics, quantum information, and quantum
computing (including cryptography) communities. In particular there has been a
major effort focused on improving the efficiency, and in particular depth, of
generating the classical snapshot.
  Existing constructions rely on a distribution of unitaries as a central
building block, and research is devoted to simplifying this family as much as
possible. We diverge from this paradigm and show that suitable distributions
over \emph{states} can be used as the building block instead. Concretely, we
create the snapshot by entangling the unknown input state with an independently
prepared auxiliary state, and measuring the resulting entangled state. This
state-based approach allows us to consider a building block with arguably
weaker properties that has not been studied so far in the context of classical
shadows. Notably, our cryptographically-inspired analysis shows that for
\emph{efficiently computable} observables, it suffices to use
\emph{pseudorandom} families of states. To the best of our knowledge,
\emph{computational} classical shadow tomography was not considered in the
literature prior to our work.
  Finally, in terms of efficiency, the online part of our method (i.e.\ the
part that depends on the input) is simply performing a measurement in the Bell
basis, which can be done in constant depth using elementary gates.

Abstract: In this work we present a comprehensive method of characterization and
optimization of laser irradiation within a confocal microscope tailored to
quantum sensing experiments using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. While confocal
microscopy is well-suited for such experiments, precise control and
understanding of several optical parameters are essential for reliable
single-emitter studies. We investigate the laser beam intensity profile,
single-photon emission statistics, fluorescence response under varying
polarization and saturation conditions, spectral characteristics, and the
temporal profiles of readout and reinitialization pulses. The beam quality is
assessed using the beam propagation factor $M^2$, determined via the razorblade
technique. Optical fluorescence spectrum is recorded to confirm NV centre
emission. To confirm single-emitter operation, we measure second-order
autocorrelation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. Saturation behaviour is analysed by
varying laser power and recording the corresponding fluorescence, while
polarization dependence is studied using a half-wave ($\lambda/2$) plate.
Temporal laser pulse profile is examined by modulating the power of an
acousto-optic modulator. After optimizing all relevant parameters, we
demonstrate the microscope's capabilities in driving spin transitions of a

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于双轨级联的CE CSS码的完整容错架构，解决了集体相干噪声对容错量子纠错的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集体相干噪声超出了传统随机噪声模型的范畴，对容错量子纠错（FTQEC）提出了挑战。CE码虽能自然避免相干噪声，但缺乏完整的容错框架。

Method: 通过双轨级联构建CE CSS码的容错架构，设计了CE保持的逻辑CNOT门和改进的Shor-和Steane型综合征提取方案。

Result: 提出了最小CE码（如[[12,1,3]]和[[14,3,3]]码），并证明[[12,1,3]]码在相干噪声下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了CE码的完整FTQEC框架，展示了其对相干噪声的鲁棒性，为相干噪声主导的量子处理器提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Collective coherent noise poses challenges for fault-tolerant quantum error
correction (FTQEC), as it falls outside the usual stochastic noise models.
While constant excitation (CE) codes can naturally avoid coherent noise, a
complete fault-tolerant framework for the use of these codes under realistic
noise models has been elusive. Here, we introduce a complete fault-tolerant
architecture for CE CSS codes based on dual-rail concatenation. After showing
that transversal CNOT gates violate CE code constraints, we introduce
CE-preserving logical CNOT gates and modified Shor- and Steane-type syndrome
extraction schemes using zero-controlled NOT gates and CE-compatible ancilla.
This enables fault-tolerant syndrome-extraction circuits fully compatible with
CE constraints. We also present an extended stabilizer simulation algorithm
that efficiently tracks both stochastic and collective coherent noise. Using
our framework, we identify minimal CE codes, including the $[[12,1,3]]$ and
$[[14,3,3]]$ codes, and demonstrate that the $[[12,1,3]]$ code achieves strong
performance under coherent noise. Our results establish the first complete
FTQEC framework for CE codes, demonstrating their robustness to coherent noise.
This highlights the potential of CE codes as a possible solution for quantum
processors dominated by collective coherent noise.

Conclusion: 该传感器在信号检测和阵列应用中具有潜在价值，如粒子轨迹探测和长基线望远镜。

Abstract: We investigate the response of a Ramsey interferometric quantum sensor based
on a frustrated, three-spin system (a Kitaev trimer) to a classical
time-dependent field (signal). The system eigenspectrum is symmetric about a
critical point, $|\vec{b}| = 0$, with four of the spectral components varying
approximately linearly with the magnetic field and four exhibiting a nonlinear
dependence. Under the adiabatic approximation and for appropriate initial
states, we show that the sensor's response to a zero-mean signal is such that
below a threshold, $|\vec{b}| < b_\mathrm{th}$, the sensor does not respond to
the signal, whereas above the threshold, the sensor acts as a detector that the
signal has occurred. This thresholded response is approximately
omnidirectional. Moreover, when deployed in an entangled multisensor
configuration, the sensor achieves sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit. Such
detectors could be useful both as standalone units for signal detection above a
noise threshold and in two- or three-dimensional arrays, analogous to a quantum
bubble chamber, for applications such as particle track detection and
long-baseline telescopy.

first introduced by Rains, and give a complete classification of the diagonal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决SK模型在计算上的困难，尤其是如何消除残余的计算差距（constant computational gap）。

Method: 采用Controlled Loosening-up (CLuP)算法，结合随机对偶理论（fl RDT）进行分析，并通过实验验证算法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，CLuP-SK算法在几千维的情况下即可达到约0.76的基态自由能，接近理论极限0.763。

Conclusion: 结论指出，CLuP-SK算法使得计算SK模型的近基态自由能成为一个实际可行的简单问题。

Abstract: We consider algorithmic determination of the $n$-dimensional
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model ground state free energy. It
corresponds to a binary maximization of an indefinite quadratic form and under
the \emph{worst case} principles of the classical NP complexity theory it is
hard to approximate within a $\log(n)^{const.}$ factor. On the other hand, the
SK's random nature allows (polynomial) spectral methods to \emph{typically}
approach the optimum within a constant factor. Naturally one is left with the
fundamental question: can the residual (constant) \emph{computational gap} be
erased?
  Following the success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP) algorithms in
planted models, we here devise a simple practical CLuP-SK algorithmic procedure
for (non-planted) SK models. To analyze the \emph{typical} success of the
algorithm we associate to it (random) CLuP-SK models. Further connecting to
recent random processes studies [94,97], we characterize the models and CLuP-SK
algorithm via fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [98]. Moreover,
running the algorithm we demonstrate that its performance is in an excellent
agrement with theoretical predictions. In particular, already for $n$ on the
order of a few thousands CLuP-SK achieves $\sim 0.76$ ground state free energy
and remarkably closely approaches theoretical $n\rightarrow\infty$ limit
$\approx 0.763$. For all practical purposes, this renders computing SK model's
near ground state free energy as a \emph{typically} easy problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非Bloch能带理论在无序系统中失效，因此需要一种新的理论框架来描述无序非Hermitian系统的谱和本征态。

Method: 通过实空间Lyapunov能带理论，建立了非Hermitian Thouless关系，并提出了拓扑判据。

Result: 发现了皮肤模和Anderson局域模的拓扑性质，揭示了皮肤-Anderson相变，并提出了单向临界态。

Conclusion: 该理论为无序非Hermitian系统提供了统一的描述，揭示了非Hermiticity、无序和拓扑之间的新联系。

Abstract: Non-Bloch band theory serves as a cornerstone for understanding intriguing
non-Hermitian phenomena, such as the skin effect and extreme spectral
sensitivity to boundary conditions. Yet this theory hinges on translational
symmetry and thus breaks down in disordered systems. Here, we develop a
real-space Lyapunov formulation of band theory that governs the spectra and
eigenstates of disordered non-Hermitian systems. This framework yields
universal non-Hermitian Thouless relations linking spectral density and
localization to Lyapunov exponents under different boundary conditions. We
further identify an exact topological criterion: skin modes and
Anderson-localized modes correspond to nonzero and zero winding numbers,
respectively, revealing the topological nature of the skin-Anderson transition.
This transition is dictated by an essential Lyapunov exponent and gives rise to
novel unidirectional critical states. Our formulation provides a unified and
exact description of spectra and localization in generic one-dimensional
non-Hermitian systems without translational symmetry, offering new insights
into the interplay among non-Hermiticity, disorder, and topology.

Result: Glauber动力学表现优于Hopfield网络，并揭示了随机波动对求解的关键作用。

Conclusion: 理论分析启发了新的确定性求解器，达到最优性能。

Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory
and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography
to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate
solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural
networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known
mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical
physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which
corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that
Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can
compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis
uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in
the absense of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins,
which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent
non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic
Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better
solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin
flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis
leads to new deterministic solvers that effectively account for such
fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of
biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could
only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a
theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of
networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By
directly analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that
all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the
classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural
activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation
function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of
threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.

Abstract: Photonic and polaritonic systems offer a fast and efficient platform for
accelerating machine learning (ML) through physics-based computing. To gain a
computational advantage, however, polaritonic systems must: (1) exploit
features that specifically favor nonlinear optical processing; (2) address
problems that are computationally hard and depend on these features; (3)
integrate photonic processing within broader ML pipelines. In this letter, we
propose a polaritonic machine learning approach for solving graph-based data
problems. We demonstrate how lattices of condensates can efficiently embed
relational and topological information from point cloud datasets. This
information is then incorporated into a pattern recognition workflow based on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leading to significantly improved
learning performance compared to physics-agnostic methods. Our extensive
benchmarking shows that photonic machine learning achieves over 90\% accuracy
for Betti number classification and clique detection tasks - a substantial
improvement over the 35\% accuracy of bare CNNs. Our study introduces a
distinct way of using photonic systems as fast tools for feature engineering,
while building on top of high-performing digital machine learning.

Abstract: The dynamics of strongly interacting quantum fluids such as Helium II are
fundamentally distinct from those of dilute, contact-interacting atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates. Most dramatically, superfluids with finite-range
interactions can support excitations with a roton-like dispersion, exhibiting a
minimum at finite wavenumber. Here we introduce a mechanism through which roton
spectra can emerge in superfluids without any nonlocal interactions, instead
resulting from the collective excitations of two counterflowing, zero-range
interacting condensates. As our mechanism relies only on the nonlinear dynamics
of classical fields, this work opens the door to the realization of roton
dynamics in the broad class of physical systems governed by coupled
nonlinear-Schr\"odinger equations.

Abstract: The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has
been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In
this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a
two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing
Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes
next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains
spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove
singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering
tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our
numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing
instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex
contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly
pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate
regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin
correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to
the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to
realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model,
from an unbiased numerical perspective.

Abstract: We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a
two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into
account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of
non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent
density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field
theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum
master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at
each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the
system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared
cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic
expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport
of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott
insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method
should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly
correlated regime.

Abstract: A central challenge in strongly interacting many-body systems is
understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we study the many-body
magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model by developing a
two-component extension of nonequilibrium bosonic dynamical mean-field theory.
Using this numerical method, we uncover rich quantum spin dynamics via
inter-species interaction quenches. A sudden ramp-up of interactions induces
slow thermalization, leading to a long-lived metastable state, whereas
quenching to weak interactions results in rapid thermal equilibrium, featuring
a two-step relaxation behavior through distinct exponential decays.
Furthermore, under periodic modulation of the inter-species interactions,
emergent Floquet dynamics drives a transition from a magnetic to an unordered
phase.

Abstract: A harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) leads to topologically
trivial compact states. Because of the long-range nonlocal dipole-dipole
interaction, a strongly dipolar BEC revealed many novel phenomena. Here we show
that in a strongly dipolar BEC one can have a hollow cylindrical
quasi-one-dimensional metastable droplet with ring topology while the system is
trapped only in the $x$-$y$ plane by a harmonic potential and a Gaussian hill
potential at the center and untrapped along the polarization $z$ axis. In this
numerical investigation we use the imaginary-time propagation of a mean-field
model where we include the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, suitably modified for
dipolar systems. Being metastable, these droplets are weakly stable and we use
real-time propagation to investigate its dynamics and establish stability.

Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed with a finite
velocity in a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied.
We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find
that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of
sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical
mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away
the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains
in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same
coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity
disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity
oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is
accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density
around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the
motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the
strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the
case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground
state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches.
We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable
slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of
motion with respect to the initial one.

Abstract: The spectrum of Markov generators encodes physical information beyond simple
decay and oscillation, which reflects irreversibility and governs the structure
of correlation functions. In this work, we prove an ellipse theorem that
provides a universal thermodynamic geometric constraint on the spectrum of
Markov rate matrices. The theorem states that all eigenvalues lie within a
specific ellipse in the complex plane. In particular, the imaginary parts of
the spectrum, which indicate oscillatory modes, are bounded by the maximum
thermodynamic force associated with individual transitions. This spectral bound
further constrains the possible values of correlation functions of two
arbitrary observables. Finally, we compare our result with a previously
proposed conjecture, which remains an open problem and warrants further

Result: 在温度界面附近不可逆性显著，提出虚拟回旋机制解释观察到的不可逆性。

Conclusion: 虚拟回旋在一维坐标上的坍缩导致无概率流，但系统仍表现出非平衡特性。

Abstract: We consider the finite-timestep Brownian dynamics of a single particle
confined in one dimension, with a nonuniform temperature profile. In such an
open-boundary scenario, one cannot observe any net probability current in the
nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). On the other hand, the nonequilibrium
nature of this system is exhibited through the asymmetry in forward and
backward transition probabilities, as is reported in this work through the
stochastic simulation analysis and theoretical arguments. The irreversibility
becomes prominent nearby the temperature interface. We propose that the
observed irreversibility can be accounted for via a virtual-gyration scenario,
while the collapse of virtual gyrations upon the one-dimensional coordinate
leads to the absence of probability current.

Conclusion: 研究为复杂或高维环境中高效搜索提供了通用框架，表明进化可能利用罕见事件动态和广泛分布的运动优化繁殖成功率。

Abstract: Finding a target in a complex environment is a fundamental challenge in
nature, from chemical reactions to sperm reaching an egg. An effective strategy
to reduce the time needed to reach a target is to deploy many searchers,
increasing the likelihood that at least one will succeed by using the
statistics of rare events. When the underlying stochastic process involves
broadly distributed step sizes, rare long jumps dominate the dynamics, making
the use of multiple searchers particularly powerful. We investigate the
statistics of extreme events for the mean first passage time in a system of $N$
independent walkers moving with jumps distributed according to a power law,
where target-reaching is governed by single, large fluctuations. We show that
the mean first passage time of the fastest walker scales as $\langle \tau_N
\rangle \sim 1/N$, representing a dramatic speed-up compared to classical
Brownian search strategies. From this, we derive a scaling law relating the
number of walkers required to reach a target within a given time to the size
$X$ of the search region. As an application, we model biological fertilization,
predicting how the optimal number of spermatozoa scales with uterus size across
species. Our predictions match empirical data, suggesting that evolution may
have exploited rare-event dynamics and broadly distributed motion to optimize
reproductive success. This theory applies broadly to any population of
searchers operating within a region of size $X$, providing a universal
framework for efficient search in disordered or high-dimensional environments.

Result: 中间平衡参数下全局有序性最高，且对密度变化更鲁棒；粒子自组织为内部对齐的子群。

Conclusion: 混合相互作用模型为生物和工程多智能体系统提供了更灵活和稳健的框架。

Abstract: From bird flocks and fish schools to migrating cell sheets, collective motion
is a ubiquitous biological phenomenon that inspires quantitative modeling
through self-propelled particle (SPP) frameworks. Conventional SPP models
prescribe either distance-based (metric) or rank-based (topological)
interactions; however, empirical studies indicate that real groups may blend
both types of interaction. Motivated by this graded perception, we introduce a
new three-dimensional SPP model in which metric and topological alignments act
simultaneously and are weighted by a single tunable mixing parameter called the
interaction parameter. Large-scale simulations spanning a wide ranges of
interaction parameters and densities revealed rich dynamics. Even when the
global order parameter is low, cluster-level analysis with HDBSCAN shows that
particles self-organize into several spatially distinct but internally
well-aligned sub-flocks, exposing a hidden layer of order. Most importantly, an
intermediate balance in which metric and topological cues contribute almost
equally maximizes the global order parameter and markedly improves robustness
to density variations. Numerical experiments supported by linear stability
analysis demonstrate that activating metric and topological interactions in
concert bridges the traditional modeling dichotomy and furnishes a more
adaptive and resilient framework for collective motion. Therefore, the proposed
model therefore provides a versatile platform for exploring mixed-interaction
effects in biological and engineered multi-agent systems.

work explores the scope of the proposed approach and investigates the
equilibrium behavior of the model under the mean-field approximation. The

exhibits strong glass-forming ability. Additionally, an upper limit for the
initial temperature is identified, beyond which quenching into the glassy state
becomes impossible.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于量子互信息（I）的距离度量d_E，并通过数值模拟验证其在1D自旋1/2 XXZ链中的表现。结果表明，在临界相中d_E表现为有效的度量空间，而在非临界相中则不符合度量空间的性质。


<details>

Motivation: 探索量子多体系统的纠缠结构是否能产生空间几何，并验证信息论定义的距离度量在量子相中的适用性。

Method: 使用密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG）模拟计算1D自旋1/2 XXZ链基态的量子互信息，并定义距离度量d_E = K_0 / sqrt(I)。

Result: 在临界相（Δ=1.0）中，互信息呈现幂律衰减，d_E表现为有效度量空间；在非临界相（Δ=2.0）中，互信息指数衰减，d_E不符合度量空间性质。

Conclusion: 信息论定义的距离度量在临界系统中能产生有效几何结构，为量子相探测提供了定量工具，并推动了对涌现空间基础的进一步研究。

Abstract: The possibility that spatial geometry may emerge from the entanglement
structure of a quantum many-body system is a subject of fundamental interest.
Here, we propose and numerically test a candidate distance metric in 1D, d_E,
defined purely from quantum mutual information (I) via the relation d_E = K_0 /
sqrt(I). Using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
simulations, we compute this emergent distance for the ground state of the 1D
spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a canonical model system. Our simulations show that in the
quantum critical phase at anisotropy $\Delta = 1.0$, the mutual information
exhibits a power-law decay consistent with the emergence of a valid metric
space. In stark contrast, within the gapped, antiferromagnetic phase ($\Delta =
2.0$), where mutual information decays exponentially, the emergent distance
grows exponentially, a behavior inconsistent with the triangle inequality.
These results provide numerical evidence that this information-theoretic
definition can yield a well-behaved geometry in critical systems, offering a
quantitative tool for probing quantum phases and motivating further analytical
investigation into the foundations of emergent space.

Result: 发现两种连通性概念在超图中表现出不同的相变行为，分别适用于开放和封闭CRN的分析。

Conclusion: 超图建模对揭示CRN复杂行为至关重要。

Abstract: Random graph models have been instrumental in characterizing complex
networks, but chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are better represented as
hypergraphs. Traditional models of random CRNs often reduce CRNs to bipartite
graphs, representing species and reactions as distinct nodes, or simpler
derived graphs, which can obscure the relationship between the statistical
properties of these representations and the physical characteristics of the
CRN. We introduce a straightforward model for generating random CRNs that
preserves their hypergraph structure as well as atomic composition, enabling
the direct study of chemically relevant features. Notably, our approach
distinguishes two notions of connectivity that are equivalent in graphs but
differ fundamentally in hypergraphs. These notions exhibit percolation-like
phase transitions, which we analyze in detail. The first type of connectivity
has relevance to steady-state synthesis and transduction, determining the
effective reactions an open CRN can perform at steady state. The second type is
suitable to identify which species can be produced from a given initial set of
species in a closed CRN. Our findings highlight the importance of
hypergraph-based modeling for uncovering the complex behaviors of CRNs.

Motivation: 理解长程相互作用下复杂相变行为，为实际材料中的相变提供理论支持。

Method: 通过有限尺寸标度分析提取临界指数，构建相图，并扩展到一维和二维海森堡模型。

Result: 在一维XY模型中，EnLRO到ReLRO的交叉点约为σ≈1.575，二维模型中约为σ≈3.2。海森堡模型中也观察到类似交叉点。

Conclusion: EnLRO和ReLRO的区分是长程相互作用连续自旋模型的普遍特征。

Abstract: Continuous spin models with long-range interactions of the form
$r^{-\sigma}$, where $r$ is the distance between two spins and $\sigma$
controls the decay of the interaction, exhibit enhanced order that competes
with thermal disturbances, leading to a richer variety of phases and types of
phase transitions. In-depth research in this area not only aids in
comprehending the complex behaviors in theoretical models but also provides
valuable insights into the diverse phase transitions observed in real
materials. Here, we identify that the true long-range ordered phase encompasses
distinct scaling regimes, which we term Enhance Long-Range Ordered (EnLRO) and
Reduce Long-Range Ordered (ReLRO) regimes. In the one-dimensional XY model, the
crossover from EnLRO to ReLRO regimes occurs around $\sigma \approx 1.575$,
while in two dimensions, the crossover happens near $\sigma \approx 3.2$.
Applying finite-size scaling analysis, we extract the critical exponents that
characterize the order-to-disorder phase transitions in the EnLRO and ReLRO
regimes, constructing comprehensive phase diagrams. The analysis is further
extended to the 1D and 2D long-range Heisenberg models, where we find the
EnLRO-ReLRO crossover at $\sigma \approx 1.575$ and $\sigma \approx 3.22$,
respectively. The similar crossover points suggest that the distinction between
EnLRO and ReLRO regimes is a generic feature in continuous spin models with
long-range interactions.

Conclusion: 大非平衡系统可能自组织以高效利用热力学资源，为MAXEP与MINEP之争提供新视角。

Abstract: Many have speculated whether nonequilibrium systems obey principles of
maximum or minimum entropy production. In this work, we use stochastic
thermodynamics to derive the condition for the minimum entropy production state
(MEPS) for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), even far from equilibrium. We
show that real nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) generally violate both the
MINEP and MAXEP principles. However, through numerical sampling of large
interconnected CTMCs, we find that as system size increases, the steady-state
entropy production tends to converge toward the minimum. This suggests that
large nonequilibrium systems may self-organize to make efficient use of
thermodynamic resources, offering a nuanced perspective on the longstanding
debate between MAXEP and MINEP.

Abstract: We analyse the transitions between established phases of the El Ni\~no
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by surveying the daily data of the Southern
Oscillation Index from an entropic viewpoint using the framework of stochastic
Statistical Physics. We evaluate the variation of entropy produced due to each
recorded path of that index during each transition as well as taking only into
consideration the beginning and the end of the change between phases and
verified both integral fluctuation relations. The statistical results show that
these entropy variations have not been extreme entropic events; only the
transition between the strong $1999-2000$ La Ni\~na to the moderate $2002-2003$
El Ni\~no is at the edge of being so. With that, the present work opens a long

Conclusion: 这一结果揭示了超统计的闭合性质，并讨论了其意义，例如在非正则稳态下，加性子系统无法实现局部热平衡（LTE）。

Abstract: Plasmas and other systems with long-range interactions are commonly found in
non-equilibrium steady states that are outside traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs
statistics, but can be described using generalized statistical mechanics
frameworks such as superstatistics, where steady states are treated as
superpositions of canonical ensembles under a temperature distribution. In this
work we solve the problem of inferring the possible steady states of a
composite system $AB$ where subsystem $A$ is described by superstatistics and
$E_{AB} = E_A + E_B$. Our result establishes a closure property of
superstatistics, namely that $A$ is described by superstatistics if and only if
$AB$ and $B$ are also superstatistical with the same temperature distribution.
Some consequences of this result are discussed, such as the impossibility of
local thermal equilibrium (LTE) for additive subsystems in non-canonical steady
states.

Conclusion: 零场分数陈绝缘体（如扭曲MoTe2）为实现强杂质条件下的任意子束缚提供了潜在平台。

Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in
strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall
(FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons
can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as
anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall
states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin
fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong
attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive
interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction
between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers
of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating
while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes
bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states
experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton
spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs
heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the
recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$
offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.

Conclusion: 该研究为费米子模拟中的无限方差问题提供了实用且稳健的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo
simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter
to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly
refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many
situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory,
and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the
algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises
as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To
remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation
method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the
infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an
exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to
the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is
straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results
establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem,
with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of
fundamental fermion simulations.

Method: 通过铝熔剂法生长单晶，结合磁性测量、热容、膨胀率和电阻率测试表征其性质。

Result: β-ErAl$_3$在5.1 K反铁磁有序，α-ErAl$_3$在5.7 K和4.6 K经历两次磁相变，表现出强各向异性和多步磁化跃迁。电阻率与磁性耦合，磁阻达60%。

Conclusion: α-ErAl$_3$的复杂磁性行为表明其存在竞争相互作用，具有Ising物理特征。

Abstract: ErAl$_3$ can form in either a trigonal ($\alpha$) or cubic ($\beta$)
polymorph and this paper investigates the physical properties of these
polymorphs through characterizations of single crystals grown in an aluminum
flux. We demonstrate that polymorph selection can be achieved based on the
nominal composition of the crystal growth. Magnetic measurements confirm that
both $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ and $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ order antiferromagnetically at low
temperatures. $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ undergoes AFM ordering at a N\'eel temperature
T$_N$ = 5.1 K, and the transition is suppressed continually with applied field.
$\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ displays more complex behavior, with successive magnetic
transitions at T$_N$ = 5.7 K and T$_2$ = 4.6 K for zero field, where heat
capacity and dilatometry measurements evidence that these transitions are
second- and first-order, respectively. Under magnetic field, strong anisotropy
is revealed in $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, with several step-like metamagnetic
transitions observed below T$_2$ for H$\parallel$c. These transitions produce
sequential magnetization plateaus near one-half of the apparent saturation
magnetization. The electrical resistivity of $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ is strongly
coupled to its magnetism. At $T$ = 2 K, we observe a positive magnetoresistance
reaching 60\%, with distinct anomalies at the metamagnetic transitions. The
results are summarized in $H$- $T$ phase diagrams that demonstrate complex
magnetic behavior for $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, suggesting an important role of
competing interactions in this metallic system that possesses characteristics
of Ising physics.

Abstract: We report an ultrafast optical spectroscopy study on the coherent phonon
dynamics in the topological semimetal CeBi and its nonmagnetic isostructural
compound LaBi, revealing profound insights into their electronic and magnetic
interactions. Both materials exhibit prominent $A_{1g}$ longitudinal optical
phonons with characteristic anharmonic temperature dependencies. However, in
CeBi, the $A_{1g}$ phonon frequency and amplitude show clear anomalies near its
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperatures ($T_{N1}$ $\simeq$ 25 K and
$T_{N2}$ $\simeq$ 12 K), which unequivocally demonstrate strong
magneto-phononic coupling. Crucially, in the AFM state at 4 K, CeBi exhibits a
pump fluence threshold of $F_C$ $\approx$ 44 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, above which the
rate of phonon softening accelerates and the amplitude increases sharply. This
unique threshold, absent in paramagnetic CeBi and LaBi, points to a
photoinduced, non-thermal quenching of the AFM order. Our findings establish
coherent phonons as highly sensitive probes of intertwined orders in heavy
fermion systems, highlighting the transformative potential of ultrafast pulses
in dynamically controlling magnetic states in correlated electron materials and
paving the way for the manipulation of emergent quantum phases.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Trigonal tr-Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_{2}$ is a well-known ferromagnetic material
that has recently drawn much attention due to the discovery of zero-field
skyrmion state, unusual anomalous Hall effect, topological Hall effect, and
topological Nernst effect. This quasi-van der Waals (vdW) layered material with
intercalated Cr atoms possesses many peculiar features that depend on the
amount of Cr intercalation, although the microscopic magnetic ground state is
still elusive. We reveal the structural and magnetic properties of
tr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$ by low-temperature x-ray diffraction, magnetization,
temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and single-crystal neutron
diffraction studies. Magnetization measurements under small applied magnetic
field indicate two successive magnetic transitions, one from a ferromagnetic
(FM) state to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state (T$_\mathrm{C}=197$ K), and
second from AFM to a paramagnetic state (T$_\mathrm{N}=211$ K). The FM
transition is sharp with a strong presence of magnetoelastic coupling, but is
not accompanied by any structural phase transition. The magnetic structure
obtained from zero-field single crystal neutron diffraction reveals that the
Cr1 and Cr2 moments are ferromagnetically aligned along the c-axis, while the
Cr3 and intercalated Cr4 atoms induce an AFM component in the ab-plane leading
to an umbrella-like spin structure which possesses a finite spin chirality. The
presence of a finite spin chirality is responsible for the observation of the

Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven
paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard
model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact
diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground
state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites.
The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$,
and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a
well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the
robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The
interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability
of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with
competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.

Abstract: We study the ground state phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model in a
half-filled 5/7 skewed ladder, which is topologically equivalent to a \{112\}
grain boundary in graphene and related systems. Using the mean-field method, we
identify various electronic and magnetic phases in the U-V plane, by
calculating the site charge and spin densities. The electronic phases include
partially charge-ordered metal or insulator, and fully charge-ordered
insulator. The different magnetic phases of the model are non-magnet, spin
density wave, spin split compensated ferrimagnet or partial antiferromagnet.
Analysis of the electronic band structure reveals that the partially
charge-ordered compensated ferrimagnetic phase exhibits spin polarisation,
which can be quite interesting for spintronics applications. We also compute
the polarisation as a function of $U$ using the Berry phase formalism and show
that the system exhibits multiferroicity with coexisting compensated
ferrimagnetic spin order alongside electronic polarisations.

Abstract: The electronic structure of the lightly hole-doped triangular-lattice moir\'e
Hubbard model is studied within cluster perturbation theory (CPT) using 13-site
clusters for a fixed doping concentration $p=1/13$ varying the Coulomb
parameter $U$ and the hopping phase parameter $\phi$ related to the
spin-orbital interaction. We have also developed a rather simple generalized
mean-field approximation (GMFA) containing the amplitude of the spin
correlations as a free parameter to fit the CPT data.The evolution of the Fermi
surface and the pseudogap with the parameters $\phi$ and $U$ is explained from
the viewpoint of the short-range magnetic order. The geometric frustration and
the additional model parameter related to the spin-orbital interaction result
in a more rich physics of the pseudogap state compared to the case of a more
conventional square lattice.

Abstract: The chiral magnetoelectric insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ hosts a rich and
anisotropic magnetic phase diagram that includes helical, conical,
field-polarized, tilted conical, and skyrmion lattice phases. Using resonant
elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), we uncover a new spiral state confined to the
surface of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. This surface-confined spiral state (SSS) displays a
real-space pitch of $\sim$120 nm, which remarkably is twice the length of the
incommensurate structures observed to-date in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The SSS phase
emerges at temperatures below 30~K when the magnetic field is applied near the
$\langle110\rangle$ crystallographic axis. Its surface localization is
demonstrated through a combination of REXS in reflection and transmission
geometries, with complementary small-angle neutron scattering measurements
suggesting its absence from the bulk. We attribute the stabilization of the SSS
to competing anisotropic interactions at the crystal surface. The discovery of
a robust, surface-confined spiral paves the way for engineering
energy-efficient, nanoscale spin-texture platforms for next-generation devices.

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron
systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide
chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a
similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to
similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a
three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using
the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic
coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate
electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective
Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is
the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth).
Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$
chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing
tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that
superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results
establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and
Fe$^{3+}$ iron chains, as well as iron ladders.

Abstract: The microscopic origin of ferromagnetism in correlated materials remains
heavily debated, particularly for the competing mechanisms governing insulating
versus metallic phases. In this work, we theoretically study the electronic
structure evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and provide a consistent
explanation to three unique features of this system, i.e. the semiconducting
ferromagnetism at low pressure, the metallic ferromagnetism at high pressure,
and the enhanced Curie temperature in the metallic phase. We propose that it is
the reduced electronic correlation and enhanced $d$-$p$ hybridization that
universally drive the continuous evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and
glue the three distinct experimental observations. Central to our discovery is
the dual role of metallicity -- it simultaneously establishes kinetically
driven exchange via $d$-$p$ hybridization and enables Stoner-type magnetic
instability, with the contribution also from the residual super-exchange. Our
analyses reveal that {\it intraband} excitations dominate the pressure-enhanced
$\omega_p^2$ and $T_c$ correlation. These findings establish $d$-$p$
hybridization and electronic correlation as the bridge between localized and
itinerant magnetism, at least, in CrGeTe$_{3}$.

Conclusion: 子晶格电流是实现奇宇称ALM的有效途径，对称性条件为其提供了理论基础，实验结果验证了其独特的物理特性。

Abstract: The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize
the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal
symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken
nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the
odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\bar{C}_2||\bar{E}]$ that
allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\bar{C}_2$ represents a
$180^\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with
the spin-space inversion, and $\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a
representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical
conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo
formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both
the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM,
and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle
direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse
optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around
the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous
Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization
$M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$
in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at
half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits
a non-monotonous behavior.

Abstract: The intertwined electron correlation and topology give birth to emergent
quantum phenomena with fractionalized phases in condensed matter physics.
Recently, Chern insulators and fractional ones with C smaller than one have
been observed in twisted MoTe2 and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moire
systems at zero magnetic fields, resembling the fractional quantum Hall phases
at high magnetic fields. Here, we target topological phases with high Chern
number C > 1 by designing a new moire system, i.e. twisted rhombohedral
trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe Chern insulators with C = 3 at both v = 1
and v = 3. In particular, quantized anomalous Hall effect with C = -3 is
observed at v = 3 for device D2. Most importantly, by fractionally filling the
high Chern number flat band, we observe evidence of a fractional Chern
insulator with C = -3/2 developing from even-denominator fractional filling v =
5/2 at zero magnetic fields, which reaches a fractionally quantized Hall effect
with C = -3/2 (a quantization accuracy of 96%) at B = 4T. We have observed
another FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, supported by the Streda formula and
anomalous Hall effects induced time reversal symmetry breakings. In addition,
we observe Chern insulators with C = 1 and 2 at even-denominator fractional
filling v = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, and strikingly, the signatures of
anomalous Hall crystal phases with high Chern numbers (C > 1) that develops
continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields
in device D1 and D3. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally
extended to other twisted graphene moire superlattices based on rhombohedral
graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern
number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond
the paradigm of the fractional phases with C < 1.

Abstract: We present results of an experimental study on single crystals of a 5d1

between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled protocols below 12 K. At magnetic
fields above 1 T the splitting is absent and the magnetic susceptibility is
featureless. A detailed specific heat study in a wide temperature range and
comprising different heat pulses did not reveal any indication of a
thermodynamic phase transition. At low temperatures we do observe specific heat
deviating from a phonon background, leading to a total electronic entropy
release of ~Rln2. Resonant and non-resonant x-ray diffraction of characteristic
Bragg peaks indicates a significant presence of disorder, potentially related
to random tilts and rotations of rigid ReO6 octahedra.

Abstract: We show that an electric field can induce nonreciprocal spin wave dispersion
in magnetic insulators with negligible spin-orbit coupling. The electric field
controls the direction and magnitude of nonreciprocity through a nonlinear
magnetoelectric effect without switching the magnetic ground state. By deriving
spin space group symmetry constraints, we find only a subset of noncoplanar
magnets exhibits this property, and identify a few candidates. For the example
of hexagonal lattice tetrahedral antiferromagnet, our effective field theory
analysis and microscopic model calculation yield results that are fully
consistent with the symmetry analysis.

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum
correlations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge
lies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal
quantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be
insufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as
superconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations,
we show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations,
occupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of
off-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at
half-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of
the superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of
particle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While
this symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it
allows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal
correlations.

Abstract: The minimal model for infinite-layer nickelates remains under debate,
particularly regarding the hybridization between itinerant interstitial-$s$ and
the correlated Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as the interaction between
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other $3d$ orbitals. Additionally, how the doped holes in
La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ are distributed among different orbitals remain
unresolved. Motivated by recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) experiments, we theoretically study the electronic structure of
infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at various doping levels. We find that,
unlike the expectation from a rigid band shift, holes are equally distributed
to Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and interstitial-$s$ orbitals. The role of
interstitial-$s$ orbital is further confirmed from the renormalization of
Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, for which the coupling between interstitial-$s$ and
Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ exerts a non-negligible impact on the orbital-selective
renormalization observed in ARPES. We also discuss the implication of our
results to the single-band model, where the interstitial-$s$ orbital in the
normal state of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ acts as charge donator enhancing the
correlation of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ by increasing its concentration close to
half-filling.

Abstract: The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant
valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore
lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to
further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when
not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices
of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite
doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron
chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA)
is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions
and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D
lattice.

Abstract: We study the phases of an exactly solvable one dimensional model with

$\Gamma-$matrix model has a large set of competing interactions and displays a
rich phase diagram with critical lines and multi-critical points. We work with
the model with certain $Z_2$ symmetries and identify the allowed symmetry
protected topological phases using the winding number as the topological
invariant. The model belongs to the CII-class of the $10-$fold classification
and allows for integer values of the winding number. We confirm that the system
also hosts localized zero energy Majorana edge modes, consistent with the
integer value of the winding number of the corresponding phase. We further
study scaling and universality behaviour of the various topological phase
transitions.

relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of
anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons
within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step
toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated
interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state,
forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact
diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of
approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of
about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional
charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized
interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a
direct optical observation of anyon-trions.

Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing
quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect
conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven
by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal
scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk
property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our
analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries,
from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high
quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This
scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface
dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium
quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the
superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set
by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for
selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum
circuits.

Conclusion: 该效应展示了高效的电荷-自旋转换，有望应用于自旋电子器件。

Abstract: We propose a tunneling spin Hall effect in a normal metal/$p$-wave
magnet/superconductor junction. It is found that the Andreev reflection in the
normal lead is spin-dependent and exhibits strong asymmetry with respect to the
transverse momentum, giving rise to a pure transverse spin Hall current with
zero net charge. The transverse spin conductance is analytically derived using
the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, revealing that the predicted spin
Hall effect is governed by the direction of the Fermi surface splitting in the
$p$-wave magnet. A finite transverse spin current with a large spin Hall angle
arises when the line connecting the centers of the spin-split Fermi surfaces is
perpendicular to the normal direction of the junction, which indicates a highly
efficient charge-to-spin conversion, suggesting potential applications in
spintronic devices.

Abstract: $\mathrm{Mn_3Sn}(0\overline{1}\overline{1}0)[0001]$ experiences a tensile
strain when grown epitaxially on $\mathrm{MgO}(110)[001]$, and thus the energy
landscape changes from six-fold symmetry to two-fold symmetry. External
magnetic field further breaks the symmetry and the \textcolor{black}{resulting
energy landscape is sensitive to} the field orientation relative to the easy
axis. \textcolor{black}{In the presence of thermal noise,} the relaxation of
the magnetic octupole moment in \textcolor{black}{a strained Mn$_3$Sn film} is
composed of four distinct escape processes involving the two saddle points and
two equilibrium states in the energy landscape. Here, we apply harmonic
transition-state theory to derive analytical expressions for the inter-well
escape time and octupole moment relaxation time, both influenced by an external
symmetry-breaking magnetic field and finite thermal noise in the
intermediate-to-high damping regime. The analytical predictions are in strong
agreement with comprehensive numerical simulations based on coupled LLG
equations. The results presented here are crucial toward realizing Mn$_3$Sn's
applications in random number generation and probabilistic computing.

Abstract: Thermal and electrical injection and transport of magnon spins in magnetic
insulators is conventionally understood by the non-equilibrium population of
magnons. However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in
noncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation
at the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is
described by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by
population -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our
quantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors
creates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins
in canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between
magnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon
correlation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes
dephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are
enhanced by magnetic fields. Spin transfer to proximity conductors can cause
extrinsic dephasing, which suppresses spin oscillations and thereby gates spin
transport.

Abstract: The quantum geometry plays a crucial role in the nonlinear transport of
quantum materials. Here, we use the Boltzmann transport formalism to study the
magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric in
two-dimensional systems with different types of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It
is shown that the nonlinear conductivity is strongly dependent on the direction
of a field and reveals significant spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the
field-direction dependent relations are distinct for different SOCs. In
addition, it is demonstrated that the contributions from the quantum metric and
Drude mechanism are distinguishable due to their opposite signs or distinct
anisotropy relations. We further derive the analytical formulas for the
anisotropic nonlinear conductivity, in exact agreement with numerical results.
Our work shines more light on the interplay between the nonlinear transport and
quantum geometry.

Abstract: Altermagnets, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent
spin splitting, have recently garnered significant attention due to their
potential applications in a variety of fields. Here, we propose a
symmetry-engineering strategy to unlock altermagnetism in two dimensional (2D)
antiferromagnetic systems via surface adsorption of atoms or molecules. By
employing spin group theory, we systematically demonstrate that selectively
breaking symmetry operations, specifically those protecting spin degeneracy in
momentum space, enables the emergence of nonrelativistic spin-split electronic
states. Meanwhile, preserving rotation or mirror symmetries connecting opposite
sublattices ensures zero net magnetization. Through a comprehensive
classification of all symmetry operations across 80 layer groups, we identify
63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups (SPGs) describing 2D materials and
further isolate 15 groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics through
surface adsorption. Exemplified with monolayer antiferromagnetic VPS_3 and
MnPSe_3, we show that oxygen adsorption on VPS_3 and NH_3 adsorption on MnPSe_3
selectively disrupt PT symmetry while retaining the [C2||m] symmetry. This
engineered symmetry reduction induces pronounced spin splitting in their band
structures without spin-orbit coupling, as confirmed by first-principles
calculations. Furthermore, adsorption energy analysis and thermal stability
phase diagrams under varying coverage regimes reveal optimal configurations for
experimental feasibility. Our work establishes a universal symmetry-engineering
framework to expand the family of altermagnetic materials, offering a versatile
pathway to tailor spin-split functionalities in two-dimensional
antiferromagnets for advanced quantum applications.

Abstract: We report charge transport measurements in a ring-shaped quadruple quantum

evaluate the interlayer energy offset. By extending this platform to triangular

isospin frustration. These results highlight the system's potential for
studying interaction-driven quantum phases.

Abstract: We predict a new class of quantum Hall phenomena in completely neutral

reveals that: (i) the singularity of line charges does not destroy topological
protection, (ii) spin-control of quantization emerges from boundary conditions
alone, and (iii) the effect persists up to 25 K, surpassing typical neutral
systems. These findings establish electric field engineering as a viable route

Abstract: Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds
significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron
tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap
of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic
configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states,
observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding
inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron
transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one
electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis
of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the
underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to
a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the
systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy
levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also
confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory
(DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of
Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.

Abstract: Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and
engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction
coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects
the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can
be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening,
leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state
friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit
solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this
work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We
formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the
resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that
this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to
efficient numerical implementation.

Abstract: Spin-orbit-torque-driven auto-oscillations in spin Hall nano-oscillators
(SHNOs) offer a transformative pathway toward energy-efficient, nanoscale
microwave devices for next-generation neuromorphic computing and high-frequency
technologies. A key requirement for achieving robust, sustained oscillations is
reducing the threshold current ($I_{\text{th}}$), strongly governed by spin
Hall efficiency ($\theta_{\text{SH}}$). However, conventional strategies to
enhance $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ face trade-offs, including high longitudinal
resistivity, interfacial effects, and symmetry-breaking torques that limit
performance. Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the bulk spin
Hall effect in PtBi alloys, achieving over a threefold increase in
$\theta_{\text{SH}}$, from 0.07 in pure Pt to 0.24 in Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$ and
0.19 in Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$, as extracted from DC-bias spin-torque
ferromagnetic resonance. The enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ originates from
bulk-dominated, extrinsic side-jump scattering across all PtBi compositions.
Correspondingly, we observe a 42\% and 32\% reduction in $I_{\text{th}}$ in 100
nm SHNOs based on Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$(4 nm)
and Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$(4 nm), respectively.
Structural characterization reveals reduced Pt crystallinity, along with
emergence of preferred crystallographic orientations upon introducing higher Bi
concentrations. Together, these results position PtBi alloys as a compelling
alternative to conventional 5$d$ transition metals, enabling enhanced
$\theta_{\text{SH}}$ and significantly lower $I_{\text{th}}$, thus opening new
avenues for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing and magnetic random access
memory.

Abstract: Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a
non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed
system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces
dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in
proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The
system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we
construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the
third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which
captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that
the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and
$\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes
(TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the
system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a
bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily
tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the
topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that
the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even
induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of
a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic
property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of
alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization
state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet can be
actively controlled. In contrast to ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode
polarization is essentially fixed, antiferromagnetic inertial modes can
continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as
the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent
critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly
polarized while its handedness reverses.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical
stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have
facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and
bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the
pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip
potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently
turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature
of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its
distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge
pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly
into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the
bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations.
Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the tip's position, intensity, and
duration on the dynamics.
