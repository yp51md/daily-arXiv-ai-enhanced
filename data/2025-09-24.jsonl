Previously identified critical states share a common\ncharacteristic: they exhibit persistent critical features in the thermodynamic\nlimit. In this Letter, we predict an exotic type of critical state, termed\nsize-dependent critical states, which exhibit a fundamentally distinct\nbehavior. Specifically, they display critical localization signatures only at\nfinite sizes, but transition to Anderson localization in the thermodynamic\nlimit. We establish that the physical origin of size-dependent critical states\nlies in the synergistic interplay between local non-reciprocal domain wall and\nNHSE. By revealing a critical phase that challenges the established paradigm of\ncritical localization, our work opens new avenues for exploring localization\nphenomena in quasiperiodic systems."}

Recent studies suggest\nthat applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure,\npotentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study,\nwe probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS\ndynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the\nstrongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric\nfield. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their\ndensities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the\nsteady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating\nbias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency\nfluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these\neffects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a\nreversible mechanism. Importantly, the intrinsic loss tangent of the LC\noscillator remains unchanged before and after the application of the\nalternating bias.

We have studied the survival probability during the\nconveyance of a particle by a trapping potential, where the particle may escape\nfrom the potential well due to quantum mechanical processes (Morita et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Research 6, 043329 (2024)). We pointed out that the escape\nmechanisms can be classified into two categories. One is an initial disturbance\ncaused by a non-analytic change of parameters at the starting point, the\nsignificance of which had been pointed out earlier by one of the authors\n(Morita, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 104001 (2007)). The other is adiabatic\ntunneling, a phenomenon that occurs due to quantum tunneling during the\nacceleration process. We have proposed a formula for the survival probability\nas a function of acceleration protocols, taking both mechanisms into account.\nIn this paper, we quantitatively examine the survival probabilities in\nconveyance processes. Surprisingly, we find that the decay behaviors under\ndifferent acceleration protocols are almost perfectly explained by the combined\neffects of the initial and final disturbances, together with an integral form\nof adiabatic tunneling throughout the transport process. Therefore, once these\ndisturbance factors and the adiabatic tunneling contribution are determined,\nthe survival probability for any acceleration protocol can be estimated without\nperforming dynamical simulations for each individual case. We also analyze the\neffects of the disturbances at the initial and final points from the\nperspective of adiabatic theory."}

Recent studies suggest\nthat applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure,\npotentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study,\nwe probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS\ndynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the\nstrongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric\nfield. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their\ndensities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the\nsteady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating\nbias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency\nfluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these\neffects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a\nreversible mechanism. Importantly, the intrinsic loss tangent of the LC\noscillator remains unchanged before and after the application of the\nalternating bias. We propose that the disappearance of the steady-state\nspectrum are caused by non-equilibrium energy build up from strain in the oxide\nfilm introduced by the pulsed voltage bias sequence.

For connectivity-constrained superconducting\narchitectures in particular, the chosen syntheses, layout, and routing\nalgorithms used to transpile a circuit drastically change the average\nutilization patterns of physical qubits.
