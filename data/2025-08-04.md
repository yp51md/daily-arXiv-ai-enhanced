Conclusion: 该方法为构造量子系统的激发态提供了通用且高效的途径。

Abstract: Excited states of many-body quantum systems play a key role in a wide range
of physical and chemical phenomena. Unlike ground states, for which many
efficient variational techniques exist, there are few ways to systematically
construct excited states of generic quantum systems on either classical or
quantum hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce a general approach
that allows us to obtain arbitrary eigenstates of quantum systems at a given
energy. By combining the shift-invert mechanism with imaginary time evolution,
we are able to avoid explicit inversion of the Hamiltonian and construct
excited eigenstates of large many-body quantum systems. We demonstrate the
technique classically by applying it to large disordered spin chains. Based on
this approach, we propose a hybrid scheme suitable for near-future quantum
hardware.

Motivation: 探索弱测量形式主义中弱值与超振荡的深层几何联系，统一理解量子力学中的测量理论与信号处理。

Method: 提出无指针的超振荡推导方法，将弱值视为几何变形比，分析其对希尔伯特空间结构的变形作用。

Result: 证明超振荡是弱值几何结构的自然结果，弱值作为变形比量化了可观测量对希尔伯特空间的相对变形。

Conclusion: 弱值与超振荡是同一几何原理的表现，为量子测量和信号处理提供了统一的几何框架。

Abstract: The formalism of weak measurement in quantum mechanics has revealed profound
connections between measurement theory, quantum foundations, and signal
processing. In this paper, we develop a pointer-free derivation of
superoscillations, demonstrating that they are a natural and necessary
consequence of the geometric structure underlying weak values. We argue that
the weak value is best understood as a ratio of geometric deformation,
quantifying how an observable transforms the structure of Hilbert space
relative to a reference provided by the standard inner product. This
deformation acts as a conceptual lens, warping the local structure of quantum
states to produce oscillations far exceeding the global Fourier bandwidth. We
formalize this by interpreting the weak value as a comparison between a
deformed sesquilinear form and the standard one, and explore its deep
connections to generalized Rayleigh quotients and the projective geometry of
quantum states. This perspective unifies weak values and superoscillations as
two facets of a single underlying geometric principle.

Abstract: Quantum Support Vector Machines face scalability challenges due to
high-dimensional quantum states and hardware limitations. We propose an
embedding-aware quantum-classical pipeline combining class-balanced k-means
distillation with pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. Our key finding:
ViT embeddings uniquely enable quantum advantage, achieving up to 8.02%
accuracy improvements over classical SVMs on Fashion-MNIST and 4.42% on MNIST,
while CNN features show performance degradation. Using 16-qubit tensor network
simulation via cuTensorNet, we provide the first systematic evidence that
quantum kernel advantage depends critically on embedding choice, revealing
fundamental synergy between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces.
This provides a practical pathway for scalable quantum machine learning that
leverages modern neural architectures.

### [4] [Casimir force between two dielectric layers: Van Kampen approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00025)
*Michael Davidovich*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 使用Van Kampen方法计算两层介电材料的Casimir力，探讨了厚度对力的影响及其模型的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Casimir力在介电层中的表现，特别是厚度对力的影响及模型的适用范围。

Method: 采用Van Kampen方法，结合Lorentz振子模型和Drude模型（金属情况），分析Casimir力的计算。

Result: Casimir力随厚度变化复杂，10 nm左右达到饱和；低厚度时力密度与厚度平方成正比，但连续模型不适用。

Conclusion: Van Kampen方法适用于任意层配置和有限温度，验证了Casimir模型与Lorentz模型的一致性。

Abstract: The Van Kampen method is used to calculate the Casimir force for two
dielectric layers. Several terms of Lorentz oscillators are used in the
permittivity model. A conductive dielectric (metal) with the Drude model is
considered as a special case. The dependence of strength on thickness has a
complex character with saturation at thicknesses of the order of 10 nm. At low
thickness, the force density is proportional to the square of the thickness,
but this is the case at low thicknesses, when the continuum model is no longer
applicable. The correspondence between the method of the Casimir model and the
Lorentz model is shown, as well as its applicability for an arbitrary
configuration of layers and for a finite temperature.

### [5] [Breakdown of Fermi's Golden Rule in 1d systems at non-zero temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00254)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究弱相互作用下1d费米子系统中准粒子寿命的标度问题，填补了传统费米黄金规则在高温下计算结果发散的理论空白。

Method: 结合数值模拟（DAOE方法）和非微扰图论重求和，预测准粒子衰减率的对数增强。

Result: 预测准粒子衰减率τ⁻¹∼Δ²logΔ⁻²，并指出这一现象广泛存在于弱相互作用量子系统中。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了准粒子衰减率的对数增强效应，并指出其在多种量子系统中的普适性。

Abstract: In interacting quantum systems, the single-particle Green's function is
expected to decay in time due to the interaction induced decoherence of
quasiparticles. In the limit of weak interaction strengths ($\Delta$), a naive
application of Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) predicts an $\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{2})$
quasiparticle decay rate. However, for 1d fermions on the lattice at $T>0$,
this calculation gives a divergent result and the scaling of the quasiparticle
lifetime with interaction strength remains an open question. In this work we
propose a solution to this question: combining numerical simulations using the
recently introduced dissipation-assisted operator evolution (DAOE) method, with
non-perturbative diagrammatic re-summations, we predict a logarithmic
enhancement of the quasiparticle decay rate $\tau^{-1} \sim \Delta^{2} \log
\Delta^{-2}$. We argue that this effect is present in a wide variety of
well-known weakly interacting quantum fermionic and bosonic systems, and even
in some classical systems, provided the non-interacting limit has
quasiparticles with a generic dispersion.

### [6] [Quantum Semi-Random Forests for Qubit-Efficient Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00027)
*Azadeh Alavi,Fatemeh Kouchmeshki,Abdolrahman Alavi,Yongli Ren,Jiayang Niu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种三阶段混合机器学习算法，通过压缩标签配置文件、在固定量子比特预算下优化特征选择，并使用仅需五个量子比特的量子半随机森林（QsRF）进行推荐评分，性能与现有方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统使用大量稀疏语义标签描述每个项目，但传统量子方法需要过多量子比特，超出当前NISQ设备能力且易受误差影响。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1）通过SVD和k-means压缩标签配置文件；2）使用QAOA在固定量子比特预算下优化特征选择；3）构建基于五个量子比特的QsRF进行推荐评分。

Result: 在ICM-150/500数据集上，100棵树的QsRF性能与全特征基线方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少量子比特需求的同时保持了推荐性能，适用于当前NISQ设备。

Abstract: Modern recommenders describe each item with hundreds of sparse semantic tags,
yet most quantum pipelines still map one qubit per tag, demanding well beyond
one hundred qubits, far out of reach for current noisy-intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices and prone to deep, error-amplifying circuits. We close
this gap with a three-stage hybrid machine learning algorithm that compresses
tag profiles, optimizes feature selection under a fixed qubit budget via QAOA,
and scores recommendations with a Quantum semi-Random Forest (QsRF) built on
just five qubits, while performing similarly to the state-of-the-art methods.
Leveraging SVD sketching and k-means, we learn a 1000-atom dictionary ($>$97 \%
variance), then solve a 2020 QUBO via depth-3 QAOA to select 5 atoms. A
100-tree QsRF trained on these codes matches full-feature baselines on
ICM-150/500.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需在算子动力学背景下细化酉设计概念，为量子优势协议提供指导，并揭示混沌多体系统的复杂性。

Abstract: Understanding how complex quantum systems emulate randomness is central to
quantum chaos, thermalization, and information theory. In one setting,
out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe
asymptotic freeness between Heisenberg operators: the non-commutative
generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct research direction,
the concept of approximate unitary designs have led to efficient constructions
of unitaries that look random according to forward-in-time protocols. Bridging
these two concepts, in this work we study the emergence of freeness from a
random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble. We prove that, with only
polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of
higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely the
observables that lead to thermal correlations in chaotic many-body systems
according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The RMPU ensemble
provably forms a unitary design, but, we argue, this does not account for
average OTOC behavior and therefore the emergence of freeness. We further
compute the ensemble's frame potential exactly to second order, showing
convergence to Haar values also with polynomial deviations, indicating that
freeness is also reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand,
to reproduce the Haar-like OTOC value for local, traceless observables, the
considered ensemble requires volume-law operator entanglement. Such
correlations therefore lie beyond the paradigm of random unitary features which
can be replicated efficiently. Our results highlight the need to refine
previous notions of unitary designs in the context of operator dynamics,
guiding us towards protocols for genuine quantum advantage while shedding light
on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.

### [8] [Hybrid Quantum Classical Surrogate for Real Time Inverse Finite Element Modeling in Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00029)
*Azadeh Alavi,Sanduni Jayasinghe,Mojtaba Mahmoodian,Sam Mazaheri,John Thangarajah,Sujeeva Setunge*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合量子经典多层感知器（QMLP）框架，用于解决大规模土木结构健康监测中的计算复杂性问题，并通过实验验证其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模土木结构的意外故障可能导致严重的经济和安全问题，而传统的有限元建模方法在实时监测中面临高计算成本和复杂性问题。

Conclusion: 量子增强方法在实时结构健康监测中具有潜力，为高效、可扩展的数字孪生提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large-scale civil structures, such as bridges, pipelines, and offshore
platforms, are vital to modern infrastructure, where unexpected failures can
cause significant economic and safety repercussions. Although finite element
(FE) modeling is widely used for real-time structural health monitoring (SHM),
its high computational cost and the complexity of inverse FE analysis, where
low dimensional sensor data must map onto high-dimensional displacement or
stress fields pose ongoing challenges. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum
classical multilayer perceptron (QMLP) framework to tackle these issues and
facilitate swift updates to digital twins across a range of structural
applications.
  Our approach embeds sensor data using symmetric positive definite (SPD)
matrices and polynomial features, yielding a representation well suited to
quantum processing. A parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) transforms these
features, and the resultant quantum outputs feed into a classical neural
network for final inference. By fusing quantum capabilities with classical
modeling, the QMLP handles large scale inverse FE mapping while preserving
computational viability.
  Through extensive experiments on a bridge, we demonstrate that the QMLP
achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0000000000316, outperforming purely
classical baselines with a large margin. These findings confirm the potential
of quantum-enhanced methods for real time SHM, establishing a pathway toward
more efficient, scalable digital twins that can robustly monitor and diagnose
structural integrity in near real time.

Conclusion: 研究结果对冷原子气体实验有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We study an out-of-equilibrium quantum system in which a state connecting two
reservoirs is also coupled by stimulated and spontaneous emission of photons to
an antitrapped state, thus implementing particle loss. After revisiting the
spontaneous emission process, we show that the proper effective description of
such a system requires one to go beyond the usual Lindbladian formalism and
includes a nonreciprocal (``non-Hermitian'') coupling to the reservoir modeling
the untrapped state. The presence of both, the reservoirs and the nonreciprocal
coupling, have observable consequences that we compute, for example, by looking
at the quantum Zeno effect in the loss current. We discuss the connection of
our findings to possible experiments in cold atomic gases.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of polynomial-depth duality transformations, which
relates two sets of operator algebras through a conjugation by a poly-depth
quantum circuit, and make use of this to construct efficient Gibbs samplers for
a variety of interesting quantum Hamiltonians as they are poly-depth dual to
classical Hamiltonians. This is for example the case for the 2D toric code,
which is demonstrated to be poly-depth dual to two decoupled classical Ising
spin chains for any system size, and we give evidence that such dualities hold
for a wide class of stabilizer Hamiltonians. Additionally, we extend the above
notion of duality to Lindbladians in order to show that mixing times and other
quantities such as the spectral gap or the modified logarithmic Sobolev
inequality are preserved under duality.

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模机器学习模型提供了一种高效的压缩和降噪解决方案。

Abstract: Schmidt decomposition of a vector can be understood as writing the singular
value decomposition (SVD) in vector form. A vector can be written as a linear
combination of tensor product of two dimensional vectors by recursively
applying Schmidt decompositions via SVD to all subsystems. Given a vector
expressed as a linear combination of tensor products, using only the $k$
principal terms yields a $k$-rank approximation of the vector. Therefore,
writing a vector in this reduced form allows to retain most important parts of
the vector while removing small noises from it, analogous to SVD-based
denoising.
  In this paper, we show that quantum circuits designed based on a value $k$
(determined from the tensor network decomposition of the mean vector of the
training sample) can approximate the reduced-form representations of entire
datasets. We then employ this circuit ansatz with a classical neural network
head to construct a hybrid machine learning model. Since the output of the
quantum circuit for an $2^n$ dimensional vector is an $n$ dimensional
probability vector, this provides an exponential compression of the input and
potentially can reduce the number of learnable parameters for training
large-scale models. We use datasets provided in the Python scikit-learn module
for the experiments. The results confirm the quantum circuit is able to
compress data successfully to provide effective $k$-rank approximations to the
classical processing component.

### [12] [Emergent Bifurcations in Quantum Circuit Stability from Hidden Parameter Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00484)
*Pilsung Kang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子电路压缩是近期量子计算的基础挑战，但电路稳定性的原理尚不明确。通过大规模数值分析，研究发现电路分为稳健和脆弱两类，其分化的根源在于门旋转参数的统计特性，而非结构。脆弱电路表现出“统计脆性”，依赖小角度门的精细调节，揭示了电路压缩中易失败的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子电路压缩的稳定性问题，探索电路在压缩过程中分化为稳健和脆弱两类的根本原因。

Method: 对300个结构均匀的量子电路（10、12、14量子比特）进行大规模数值分析，研究其门旋转参数的统计特性。

Result: 发现电路分化为稳健和脆弱两类，脆弱电路具有低参数变异性和缺乏小角度门的特征，其功能依赖小角度门的精细调节。

Conclusion: 电路稳定性由门旋转参数的微观统计特性决定，而非宏观结构，为设计稳健量子算法提供了新框架。

Abstract: The compression of quantum circuits is a foundational challenge for near-term
quantum computing, yet the principles governing circuit stability remain poorly
understood. We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical
analysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits.
Despite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally
bifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of
this emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but
is instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation
parameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of
``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a
scarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for
this phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are
counter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most
pronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why
statistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under
compression. These findings establish a new framework for engineering resilient
quantum algorithms, shifting the focus from macroscopic structure to the
microscopic statistical properties of a circuit's parameters.

Conclusion: 该变分方案为基态关联计算提供了高效且全面的方法。

Abstract: We introduce a variational scheme inspired by classical shadow tomography to
compute ground state correlations of quantum spin Hamiltonians. Shadow
tomography allows for efficient reconstruction of expectation values of
arbitrary observables from a bag of repeated, randomized measurements, called
snapshots, on copies of the state $\rho$. The prescription allows one to infer
expectation values of $M$ $k-$local observables to accuracy $\epsilon$ using
just $N \sim 3^k \text{log}M /\epsilon^2$ snapshots when measurements are
performed in locally random bases. Turning this around, a bag of snapshots can
be considered an efficient representation of the state $\rho$, particularly for
estimating low-weight observables, such as terms in a local Hamiltonian needed
to estimate the energy. Inspired by this, we consider a variational scheme
wherein a bag of $N$ parametrized snapshots is used to represent the putative
ground state of a desired local spin Hamiltonian and optimized to lower the
energy with respect to it. Additional constraints in the form of positivity of
reduced density matrices, motivated by work in quantum chemistry, are employed
to ensure compatibility of the predicted correlations with the underlying
Hilbert space. Unlike reduced density matrix approaches, learning the
underlying distribution of measurement outcomes allows one to further
correlations beyond those in the constrained density matrix. We show, with
numerical results, that the proposed variational method can be parallelized, is
efficiently simulable, and yields a more complete description of the ground
state.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将硅量子点的三维描述降维为二维包络函数理论的方法，用于电子自旋量子比特的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更高效地模拟量子比特系统，同时保留关键的静电和谷自由度信息。

Method: 通过Born-Oppenheimer启发的包络函数方法，系统地将垂直维度积分掉，得到有效的平面势。

Result: 验证了方法的准确性，优于简单的二维切片，尤其在界面粗糙度存在时。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅计算效率高，还首次从基本原理中明确引入了谷自由度，为量子比特操作提供了概念清晰的理论基础。

Abstract: We present a rigorous method to reduce the three-dimensional (3D) description
of a quantum dot in silicon to an effective two-dimensional (2D) envelope
function theory for electron spin qubits. By systematically integrating out the
strongly confined vertical dimension using a Born-Oppenheimer-inspired ansatz
at the envelope-function level, we derive an effective in-plane potential that
faithfully captures the essential electrostatics of the full 3D system.
Considering the lowest two eigenstates of the out-of-plane direction, this
reduction leads to the natural and explicit emergence of the valley degree of
freedom within a 2D formalism, which is derived here from first principles. We
validate the accuracy of the method through comparisons with full 3D
simulations and demonstrate its superiority over naive 2D slicing, particularly
in the presence of interface roughness. Crucially, the reduction in
dimensionality leads to substantial computational savings, making our approach
particularly well suited for simulating two-electron systems, e.g., for the
extraction of parameters such as the exchange coupling. Beyond its practical
utility, the rigorous 2D envelope function theory that is introduced in this
study incorporates valley physics in a physically grounded manner, offering
conceptual clarity on the role of valley states in qubit operation and
measurement.

### [15] [Are controlled unitaries helpful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00055)
*Ewin Tang,John Wright*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文证明，对于许多量子问题，使用控制量子门（cU）并不比直接使用U更有优势，并提出了一种“去控制”方法，将使用cU的电路转换为仅使用U的电路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究控制量子门（cU）是否对解决量子问题有实质性帮助，并反驳文献中关于去控制不可能的负面结论。

Method: 提出了一种“去控制”技术，将使用cU和cU†的电路转换为仅使用U和U†的电路，输出带有随机相位的结果。

Result: 证明cU仅因其包含U的全局相位信息而有帮助，去控制后的电路在忽略全局相位时仍有效。

Conclusion: 去控制技术可行且有用，为量子计算中的伪随机性提供了简单证明。

Abstract: Many quantum algorithms, to compute some property of a unitary $U$, require
access not just to $U$, but to $cU$, the unitary with a control qubit. We show
that having access to $cU$ does not help for a large class of quantum problems.
For a quantum circuit which uses $cU$ and $cU^\dagger$ and outputs
$|\psi(U)\rangle$, we show how to ``decontrol'' the circuit into one which uses
only $U$ and $U^\dagger$ and outputs $|\psi(\varphi U)\rangle$ for a uniformly
random phase $\varphi$, with a small amount of time and space overhead. When we
only care about the output state up to a global phase on $U$, then the
decontrolled circuit suffices. Stated differently, $cU$ is only helpful because
it contains global phase information about $U$.
  A version of our procedure is described in an appendix of Sheridan, Maslov,
and Mosca [SMM09]. Our goal with this work is to popularize this result by
generalizing it and investigating its implications, in order to counter
negative results in the literature which might lead one to believe that
decontrolling is not possible. As an application, we give a simple proof for
the existence of unitary ensembles which are pseudorandom under access to $U$,
$U^\dagger$, $cU$, and $cU^\dagger$.

Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of replacement-type quantum gates. This type of
gate introduces input qubits, candidate qubits, and output qubits. The
candidate qubits are prepared such, that a displacement conditional on the
input qubit results in the targeted output state. Finally, the circuit
continues with the output qubits constructed from the candidate qubits instead
of the input qubits, thus the name "replacement-type gate". We present examples
of replacement-type $X$ and $\mathrm{CNOT}$ gates realized with spin qubits and
with neutral atom qubits. By making use of the extended Hilbert space,
including the position of the particles, these gates approximately preserve the
innate noise bias of the qubits. The gate preserves the noise-bias which
motivates advanced quantum computer architectures with error correction.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了电场基截断误差的估计精度，为量子计算中的规范理论模拟提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: The encoding of lattice gauge theories onto quantum computers requires a
discretization of the gauge field's Hilbert space on each link, which presents
errors with respect to the Kogut--Susskind limit. In the electric basis,
Hilbert space fragmentation has recently been shown to limit the excitation of
large electric fields. Here, we leverage this to develop a formalism for
estimating the size of truncation errors in the electric basis. Generically,
the truncation error falls off as a factorial of the field truncation. Examples
of this formalism are applied to the Schwinger model and a pure U(1) lattice
gauge theory. For reasonable choices of parameters, we improve on previous
error estimates by a factor of 10^{306}.

Method: 研究了硬件计算结构，提出分层可中断量子电路模型，并设计可扩展算法进行验证，时间复杂度为$O(d^2 t \log (n/\delta))$。

Result: 方法显著减少验证时间，问题规模呈双对数缩放，并通过IBM量子云服务实验验证。

Conclusion: 该方法在嘈杂中等规模量子时代具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Designing quantum processors is a complex task that demands advanced
verification methods to ensure their correct functionality. However,
traditional methods of comprehensively verifying quantum devices, such as
quantum process tomography, face significant limitations because of the
exponential growth in computational resources. These limitations arise from
treating the system as a black box and ignoring its design structure.
Consequently, new testing methods must be developed considering the design
structure. In this paper, we investigate the structure of computations on the
hardware, focusing on the layered interruptible quantum circuit model and
designing a scalable algorithm to verify it comprehensively. Specifically, for
a given quantum hardware that claims to process an unknown $n$ qubit $d$ layer
circuit via a finite set of quantum gates, our method completely reconstructs
the circuits within a time complexity of $O(d^2 t \log (n/\delta))$,
guaranteeing success with a probability of at least $1-\delta$. Here, $t$
represents the maximum execution time for each circuit layer. Our approach
significantly reduces execution time for completely verifying computations in
quantum devices, achieving double logarithmic scaling in the problem size.
Furthermore, we validate our algorithm through experiments using IBM's quantum
cloud service, demonstrating its potential applicability in the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个新的度量标准——纠缠能力偏差（EPD），作为传统纠缠能力（EP）的补充，以更全面地量化量子操作的纠缠生成特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统纠缠能力（EP）无法捕捉纠缠生成的输入状态依赖性，因此需要一种新的度量标准来补充这一不足。

Method: 通过群论框架，推导出EP和EPD的闭式表达式，并分析了两量子比特门和广义受控酉操作。

Result: 研究发现增强纠缠能力会不可避免地增加对特定输入状态的敏感性，且EP相同的门可能具有显著不同的EPD值。

Conclusion: EPD与EP结合能更全面地表征纠缠结构，揭示了纠缠强度与均匀性之间的固有权衡。

Abstract: Quantifying the entangling capability of quantum operations is a fundamental
task in quantum information science. Traditionally, this capability is measured
by the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated
when a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states.
However, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of
entanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric --
entangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement
generated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted
nature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework
that yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis reveals a
fundamental and previously unexplored physics: enhancing entangling capability
inevitably increases sensitivity, or bias, toward specific input states. By
analyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical
EP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of
entanglement generation can significantly differ depending on physical
implementation. Extending our framework to a class of generalized
controlled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary
dimensions, we (re)affirm the inherent trade-off between the entangling
strength and uniformity. Moreover, we uncover a subtle
dimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone
fails to detect. These findings highlight EPD as an indispensable diagnostic
tool -- one that, alongside EP, provides a deeper and more complete
characterization of the entangling structure.

Conclusion: 多二能级系统与共同环境的相互作用显著增强非马尔可夫性，为量子技术中利用非马尔可夫性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Non-Markovian effects are often significant when the system-environment
coupling is not weak. Indeed, we find the non-Markovianity to be negligible for
a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing via interaction with a
harmonic oscillator environment. In this paper, we examine a natural extension,
namely a pure dephasing model where a collection of two-level systems interacts
with a common environment. We obtain analytically the dynamics of the
collection of the two-level systems, and then take a partial trace over all the
two-level systems except one. This remaining single two-level system is shown
to display markedly non-Markovian dynamics, even in the weak system-environment
coupling regime. This is due to the indirect interaction between two-level
systems induced by their interaction with the common environment. In fact, this
indirect interaction can not only increase the non-Markovianity by orders of
magnitude, but also display qualitatively different characteristics. For
instance, for a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing, the dynamics
are Markovian for Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments. This is markedly not the
case when we consider multiple two-level systems. We also show that the
non-Markovianity increases as we increase the number of two-level systems.
These findings provide insights into controlling decoherence in multi-qubit
quantum systems and have implications for quantum technologies where
non-Markovianity can be a resource rather than a limitation.

Abstract: The entanglement properties of mixed states are of great importance in the
study of open quantum systems and quantum information science, but commonly
used entanglement measures, such as negativity, can be difficult to apply or
connect to physical properties of the system. We introduce the Cauchy-Schwarz
Violation (CSV) Condition, which has a simple dependence on the populations and
coherences of the density operator. A sufficient condition for entanglement, it
provides a more direct connection to the physical characteristics of the system
such as its symmetries. We illustrate the often surprising insights gained from
the CSV condition by applying it to the Jaynes-Cummings Model, the Quantum Rabi
Model, and an open-system Quantum Rabi Model.

Result: 在iPEPS和pMPS等示例中，该方法提供了比标准初始化更低的初始截断误差。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升张量网络的压缩效率，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Loopy tensor networks have internal correlations that often make their
compression inefficient. We show that even local bond optimization can make
better use of the insight it has locally into relevant loop correlations. By
cutting the bond, we define a set of states whose linear dependence can be used
to truncate the bond dimension. The linear dependence is eliminated with zero
modes of the states' metric tensor. The method is illustrated by a series of
examples for the infinite pair entangled projected state (iPEPS) and for the
periodic matrix product state (pMPS) that occurs in the tensor renormalization
group (TRG) step. In all examples, it provides better initial truncation errors
than standard initialization.

Abstract: We propose an experimentally feasible optomechanical system (OMS) that is
dispersively driven and operates in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR),
where the mechanical damping rate far exceeds the cavity decay rate. We
demonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser
frequency-on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time-allows for
adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric
amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This
mechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE),
leads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that
the total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified
by a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not
only saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time
scales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in
their dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the
Kerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical
features, including sub-Poissonian statistics, negative Wigner function and
quadrature squeezing which can be controlled by adjusting the system
parameters. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the
potential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as
well as microwave quantum sensing.

Abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis is the task of decomposing a given quantum operator
into a sequence of elementary quantum gates. Since the finite target gate set
cannot exactly implement any given operator, approximation is often necessary.
Model counting, or #SAT, has recently been demonstrated as a promising new
approach for tackling core problems in quantum circuit analysis. In this work,
we show for the first time that the universal quantum circuit synthesis problem
can be reduced to maximum model counting. We formulate a #SAT encoding for
exact and approximate depth-optimal quantum circuit synthesis into the
Clifford+T gate set. We evaluate our method with an open-source implementation
that uses the maximum model counter d4Max as a backend. For this purpose, we
extended d4Max with support for complex and negative weights to represent
amplitudes. Experimental results show that existing classical tools have
potential for the quantum circuit synthesis problem.

Result: Q2模型中的攻击将时间复杂度降低了2^{4.5n}倍；Q1模型中的攻击仅需常数个明文-密文对即可恢复密钥。

Conclusion: FBC算法在量子攻击下存在显著安全漏洞，需进一步优化以应对量子威胁。

Abstract: With the advancement of quantum computing, symmetric cryptography faces new
challenges from quantum attacks. These attacks are typically classified into
two models: Q1 (classical queries) and Q2 (quantum superposition queries). In
this context, we present a comprehensive security analysis of the FBC algorithm
considering quantum adversaries with different query capabilities. In the Q2
model, we first design 4-round polynomial-time quantum distinguishers for FBC-F
and FBC-KF structures, and then perform $r(r>6)$-round quantum key-recovery
attacks. Our attacks require $O(2^{(2n(r-6)+3n)/2})$ quantum queries, reducing
the time complexity by a factor of $2^{4.5n}$ compared with quantum brute-force
search, where $n$ denotes the subkey length. Moreover, we give a new 6-round
polynomial-time quantum distinguisher for FBC-FK structure. Based on this, we
construct an $r(r>6)$-round quantum key-recovery attack with complexity
$O(2^{n(r-6)})$. Considering an adversary with classical queries and quantum
computing capabilities, we demonstrate low-data quantum key-recovery attacks on
FBC-KF/FK structures in the Q1 model. These attacks require only a constant
number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs, then use the Grover algorithm to search
the intermediate states, thereby recovering all keys in $O(2^{n/2})$ time.

Abstract: The maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree reconstruction problem is NP-hard,
presenting a computational bottleneck for classical computing and motivating
the exploration of emerging paradigms like quantum computing. To this end, we
design three optimization models compatible with both classical and quantum
solvers. Our method directly searches the complete solution space of all
possible tree topologies and ancestral states, thereby avoiding the potential
biases associated with pre-constructing candidate internal nodes. Among these
models, the branch-based model drastically reduces the number of variables and
explicit constraints through a specific variable definition, providing a novel
modeling approach effective not only for phylogenetic tree building but also
for other tree problems. The correctness of this model is validated with a
classical solver, which obtains solutions that are generally better than those
from heuristics on the GAPDH gene dataset. Moreover, our quantum simulations
successfully find the exact optimal solutions for small-scale instances with
rapid convergence, highlighting the potential of quantum computing to offer a
new avenue for solving these intractable problems in evolutionary biology.

Abstract: As physical realizations of quantum computers move closer towards practical
applications, the need for tools to analyze and verify quantum algorithms
grows. Among the algorithms and data structures used to tackle such problems,
decision diagrams (DDs) have shown much success. However, an obstacle with DDs
is their efficient parallelization, and while parallel speedups have been
obtained for DDs used in classical applications, attempts to parallelize
operations for quantum-specific DDs have yielded only limited success. In this
work, we present an efficient implementation of parallel edge-valued DDs, which
makes use of fine-grained task parallelism and lock-free hash tables.
Additionally, we use these DDs to implement two use cases: simulation and
equivalence checking of quantum circuits. In our empirical evaluation we find
that our tool, Q-Sylvan, shows a single-core performance that is competitive
with the state-of-the-art quantum DD tool MQT DDSIM on large instances, and
moreover achieves parallel speedups of up to x18 on 64 cores.

Conclusion: 结合GKP码的量子中继方案在特定参数范围内表现更优，为量子通信提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: There are various approaches to long-range quantum communication based on
conceptually different forms of quantum repeaters. Here we explore a quantum
repeater scheme that employs quantum error correction (QEC) both on the flying
(light) qubits and on the stationary (matter) qubits. The idea is to combine
the benefits of encoded one-way and two-way schemes where effective channel
transmission and loss scaling are enhanced by means of photon loss codes and
encoded quantum memories, respectively, while sacrificing some of their
advantages such as high clock rates, independent of classical communication
times (one-way), and potentially large segment lengths (two-way). More
specifically, we illustrate, propose, and analyze such a quantum repeater using
the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code which naturally enables
encoding and QEC of qudits, protecting them against transmission and memory
loss, the latter, for instance, occuring on collective spin modes of atomic
ensembles. While the encoded one-way and two-way schemes on their own either
require very high repeater link coupling efficiencies and GKP squeezing or
allow for experimentally more feasible, small values of these parameters,
respectively, we find that there are intermediate parameter regimes where the
combined repeater protocol is superior.

Motivation: 探索如何在量子行走中保持和增强量子相干性，特别是在对称或随机图中。

Method: 使用对称提升${\mathrm{HL}}'_2(G)$构造完美图，并通过量子资源理论的标准度量（如IPR、纯度等）量化相干性。

Result: 提升操作在小图中保留了周期性相干性，在随机图中引入了结构化干涉并显著提高了返回概率。

Conclusion: ${\mathrm{HL}}'_2$提升是一种可扩展且结构化的机制，能有效组织量子干涉，支持长时间的量子相干性。

Abstract: We study quantum coherence in continuous-time quantum walks on perfect graphs
generated by the symmetric lift ${\mathrm{HL}}'_2(G)$, a canonical, unweighted,
undirected construction defined as the line graph of a bipartite double cover
of $G$. This lift acts as both a coherence-preserving and coherence-inducing
transformation: it preserves and scales structured quantum interference in
highly symmetric base graphs, and induces sustained coherence in random or
weakly structured ones.
  In small graphs such as $K_4$, $K_5$, and the Petersen graph, where quantum
walks exhibit sharp revivals and high return probability, repeated
$\mathrm{HL}'_2$ lifting produces towers of perfect graphs with thousands to
tens of thousands of vertices that retain periodic or quasi-periodic coherence.
When applied to random regular or Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs with flat or
decaying return behavior, the lift introduces structured interference and
significant amplification of mean and peak return probabilities.
  To quantify these effects, we evaluate standard coherence metrics from
quantum resource theory, including inverse participation ratio (IPR), purity,
relative entropy of coherence, and the logarithmic coherence number. These
measures confirm that $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ lifting delocalizes eigenstates,
increases coherence entropy, and expands the basis support of quantum states.
These results demonstrate that $\mathrm{HL}'_2$ is a scalable and structurally
grounded mechanism for organizing quantum interference, and introduce a new
family of perfect graphs that support long-time quantum coherence without

Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a fundamental protocol in quantum information
processing that enables the distribution of entanglement between distant
quantum systems. In this work, we first extend the concept of entanglement
swapping to higher-dimensional quantum systems, specifically qudits. We then
analyze the dynamics of entanglement swapping and quantify the average swapped
entanglement in terms of concurrence and negativity. Our results demonstrate
that higher-dimensional systems offer enhanced entanglement distribution
capabilities compared to qubit-based protocols. We also discuss the application
of entangled qudits in terms of long-distance teleportation that provides the
base for quantum repeaters. Furthermore, we discuss the entanglement swapping
for a real and noisy system. The behaviors of entanglement against fidelity
with different dimensions are also discussed.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了超强耦合的物理本质，澄清了极化自能项的作用，并呼吁重新评估相关文献。

Abstract: Theoretical accounts of ultrastrongly coupled light-matter systems commonly
assume that it arises from the interaction of an emitter with propagating
photon modes supported by a structure, understanding photons as the excitations
of the transverse electromagnetic field. This description discards the Coulomb
interaction between the emitter and structure charges. Here, we show with a
general argument based on electromagnetic constraints that the emitter-photon
coupling strength is fundamentally limited. Accordingly, we conclude that the
ultrastrong coupling regime cannot be reached with photons. Instead, it must
originate from the Coulomb interactions between charges. A further corollary is
that the so-called polarization self-energy term does not need to be included.
We illustrate our claims by solving an analytical model of the paradigmatic
case of an emitter next to a metallic nanosphere. These findings shed light on
the fundamental processes underlying ultrastrong coupling, clarify the role of
the polarization self-energy term and compel a reevaluation of previous
literature.

Abstract: Magic or non-stabilizerness is a resource for quantum computing that has been
extensively studied in qudit networks. It describes the degree to which
Clifford gates cannot generate a given state, capturing the advantage of
quantum over classical computing. However, its definition in continuous
variables and general composite systems remains an open issue. We study magic
in a bipartite system, the Asymmetric Quantum Rabi model, a paradigmatic model
from quantum optics. We explore the presence of magic in the qubit-reduced
system throughout the Hamiltonian parameter space, the role of light-matter
interactions in its generation, and the manifestation of Wigner function
negativity in the corresponding bosonic degree of freedom. Finally, we discuss
our results for magic state preparation in the strong and ultra-strong coupling
regimes within the context of quantum informational systems.

Abstract: Quantum Information Networks (QIN) attract increasing interest, as they will
enable interconnection of multiple quantum devices in a distributed
organization thus enhancing intrinsic computing, sensing, and security
capabilities. The core mechanism of a QIN is quantum state swapping, based on
teleportation, which consumes quantum entanglement, and which can be seen in
this context as a new kind of network resource. The satellite is expected to
play a central role for supporting global connectivity in such novel networks
in which ground fiber links have stringent restrictions in length due to the
absorption losses in optical fibers. There is indeed fundamental limits in the
maximal fiber links distance which may not be exceeded for any unitary links.
In this paper we clarify our motivations to develop such networks with
satellites, and we discuss their associated use cases based on entanglement
distribution, and we present the future potential users. We also assess
quantitatively the ranges for which the satellite becomes mandatory in quantum
information networks.

Abstract: Periodically structured surfaces (metasurfaces), i.e., periodic light, have
evolved as a powerful tool for manipulating electromagnetic fields both in
classical and quantum regimes. However, no general approach for quantizing the
electromagnetic fields and treating quantum light-matter interactions in such
structures exists. Here, we construct an ab initio few-mode quantization scheme
for metasurface resonances based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. We use
our approach to propose a framework for strong light-matter coupling in which
collective excitations of periodic arrays of quantum emitters are strongly
coupled to the light modes supported by the metasurface, leading to the
formation of crystal polaritons. As a proof-of-principle example of their
potential, we show that interactions between crystal polaritons can lead to an
efficient and directional generation of entangled photon pairs.

Abstract: Mixed state ensembles such as the Bures-Hall and Hilbert-Schmidt measure are
probability distributions that characterise the statistical properties of
random density matrices and can be used to determine the typical features of
mixed quantum states. Here we extend this framework by considering the
properties of random states with fixed average energy, and the
ensemble-averaged density matrix is derived under this additional physical
constraint. This gives rise to a type of microcanonical ensemble for random
mixed states and we connect its properties to a statistical mechanical entropy
and temperature. Our results are illustrated using a variety of simple spin
systems, and we find that they can exhibit exotic features such as phase
transitions in the absence of interactions and finite relative energy
fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit.

Abstract: We extend the entanglement swapping protocol (ESP) to partially entangled
qudit states and analyze the process within the framework of complete
complementarity relations (CCRs). Building on previous results for qubits, we
show that the average distributed entanglement between two parties via ESP is
bounded above by the initial entanglement of one of the input pairs, and also
by the product of the initial entanglements. Notably, we find that using
initial states with vanishing local quantum coherence is sufficient to capture
the essential features of the protocol, simplifying the analysis. By exploring
the cases of qubits and qutrits, we observe that the upper bound on the average
distributed entanglement -- expressed in terms of the product of the initial
entanglements -- can be improved, and we conjecture what this tighter bound
might be. Finally, we discuss the role of quantum complementarity in the ESP
and show how local predictability constrains the entanglement that can be
operationally distributed via ESP.

Result: NQS表现出双下降现象，但第二下降发生在网络规模远大于希尔伯特空间维度时，表明NQS通常在欠参数化状态下运行。

Conclusion: NQS的设计需要结合对称性和物理知识，而非直接套用机器学习启发式方法。

Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) provide flexible wavefunction parameterizations
for numerical studies of quantum many-body physics. While inspired by deep
learning, it remains unclear to what extent NQS share characteristics with
neural networks used for standard machine learning tasks. We demonstrate that
NQS exhibit the double descent phenomenon, a key feature of modern deep
learning, where generalization worsens as network size increases before
improving again in an overparameterized regime. Notably, we find the second
descent to occur only for network sizes much larger than the Hilbert space
dimension, indicating that NQS typically operate in an underparameterized
regime, where increasing network size can degrade generalization. Our analysis
reveals that the optimal network size in this regime depends on the number of
unique training samples, highlighting the importance of sampling strategies.
These findings suggest the need for symmetry-aware, physics-informed
architecture design, rather than directly adopting machine learning heuristics.

Abstract: We investigate spin correlations in one-dimensional $SU(2)$-invariant
Heisenberg chains with exchange disorder for spin lengths $S=1/2$ and $S=1$. In
the weak-disorder regime, the eigenmodes of the spin-spin correlation matrix
are delocalized, consistent with ergodic behavior. Under strong disorder, the
system enters a quasi-localized multifractal phase characterized by
exponentially decaying, dimer-like spin correlations. Finite-size scaling of
the inverse participation ratios of the correlation-matrix eigenmodes yields a
correlation dimension, $D_2\approx 0.37-0.39$, confirming the stability of a
multifractal regime that is distinct from both the ergodic limit ($D_2=1$) and
the fully localized limit ($D_2=0$).

Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature properties of a mobile impurity immersed
in a bath of bosonic particles confined to a square lattice. We analyze the
regimes of attractive and repulsive coupling between the impurity and the bath
particles for different strengths of boson-boson interactions in the bath,
using exact large-scale quantum Monte-Carlo simulations in the grand canonical
ensemble. For weak coupling, the polaron mass ratio is found to decrease around
the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition of the bath, as predicted
by recent theory, confirming the possible use of the impurity as a probe for
the transition. For strong coupling in the MI regime, instead, the impurity is
found to modify the bath density by binding to an extra bath particle or a
hole, depending on the sign of the polaron-bath interactions. While the binding
prevent the aforementioned use of the polaron mass ratio as an MI-SF transition
probe, we show that it can be used instead as a probe of the binding itself.
Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark for comparing lattice Bose
polaron theories and are relevant for experiments with cold atoms trapped in
optical lattices, where the presence of a confining harmonic potential can be
modeled by a slowly varying local chemical potential.

the electronic excited state to reduce the size of the dressed-state basis in
which the dressed Hamiltoninan is expressed. In an application, we investigate
the feasibility of two-photon collisional shielding between two \NaK molecules,
which could be favored by the Raman resonance condition suppressing unwanted
spontaneous emission and photon scattering. We demonstrate the influence of the
laser Rabi frequencies on the dynamics through the computation of elastic,

Conclusion: 挑战了以往关于强长程相互作用量子系统中ETH违反的结论。

Abstract: Understanding the stability of integrability in many-body quantum systems is
key to controlling their dynamics and predicting thermalization. While much is
known about how integrability breaks down in short-range interacting systems,
the corresponding picture for long-range couplings remains incomplete. Yet
long-range interactions are both ubiquitous in nature and readily engineered in
modern experimental platforms. Here, we show that integrability in fully
connected models is either robust or extremely fragile depending on whether the
perturbation is non-extensive, extensive one-body, or extensive two-body. In a
finite system with short-range interactions, any of these perturbations can
induce chaos when applied with finite strength. In contrast, in fully connected
finite models, chaos is induced by extensive two-body perturbations, and they
do so even at infinitesimal strength. In this case, chaos emerges within
quasi-symmetry sectors, leading to a fragmented manifestation of the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This challenges previous claims of ETH
violation in quantum systems with strong long-range interactions.

Conclusion: NNET扩展了非平衡系统的描述能力，未来将探讨其在非线性高阶系统及振荡或尖峰行为中的应用。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, termed Nambu
Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics (NNET), which integrates reversible dynamics
governed by the Nambu bracket with irreversible dynamics driven by entropy
gradients. This framework is developed axiomatically and enables the
description of far-from-equilibrium systems in which entropy can transiently
decrease -- a regime difficult to handle within conventional approaches such as
Onsager's linear response theory, Prigogine's General Evolution Criterion
(GEC), or the GENERIC framework.
  As an illustrative example, we analyze a triangular chemical reaction system.
We demonstrate that, without assuming detailed balance or linearity, two
geometric conserved quantities naturally emerge: one associated with cyclic
symmetry in the reaction space, and another that vanishes under symmetric
reaction rates. This highlights the extended descriptive power of NNET and its
capacity to unify cyclic dynamics and dissipation within a covariant structure.
The generalization to higher-order nonlinear systems and applications to
oscillatory or spiking non-equilibrium behavior will be discussed in subsequent
papers.

Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are naturally expressed using
variables that take on more than two discrete values. To solve such problems
using Ising machines (IMs) - specialized analog or digital devices designed to
solve COPs efficiently - these multi-valued integers must be encoded using
binary spin variables. A common approach is one-hot encoding, where each
variable is represented by a group of spins constrained so that exactly one
spin is in the "up" state. However, this encoding introduces energy barriers:
changing an integer's value requires flipping two spins and passing through an
invalid intermediate state. This creates rugged energy landscapes that may
hinder optimization. We propose a higher-order Ising formulation for Max-3-Cut,
which is the smallest fundamental COP with multi-valued integer variables. Our
formulation preserves valid configurations under single-spin updates. The
resulting energy landscapes are smoother, and we show that this remains true
even when the binary variables are relaxed to continuous values, making it
well-suited for analog IMs as well. Benchmarking on such an IM, we find that
the higher-order formulation leads to significantly faster solutions than the
Ising baseline. Interestingly, we find that an empirical rescaling of some
terms in the Ising formulation - a heuristic proposed in prior work -
approaches the performance of the higher-order Ising formulation, underscoring
the importance of empirical parameter tuning in COP encodings.

Abstract: While phases and phase transitions are conventionally described by local
order parameters in real space, we present a unified framework characterizing
the phase transition through the geometry of configuration space defined by the
statistics of pairwise distances $r_H$ between configurations. Focusing on the
concrete example of Ising spins, we establish crucial analytical links between
this geometry and fundamental real-space observables, i.e., the magnetization
and two-point spin correlation functions. This link unveils the universal
scaling law in the configuration space: the standard deviation of the
normalized distances exhibits universal criticality as
$\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(r_H)}\sim L^{-2\beta/\nu}$, provided that the system
possesses zero magnetization and satisfies $4\beta/\nu < d$. Numerical
stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo simulations on the
transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) validate this scaling law: (i) It is
perfectly validated in the one-dimensional TFIM, where all theoretical criteria
are satisfied; (ii) Its robustness is confirmed in the two-dimensional TFIM,
where, despite the theoretical applicability condition being at its marginal
limit, our method robustly captures the effective scaling dominated by physical
correlations; (iii) The method's specificity is demonstrated via a critical
control experiment in the orthogonal $\hat{\sigma}^x$ basis, where no
long-range order exists, correctly reverts to a non-critical background
scaling. Moreover, the distribution probability $P(r_H)$ parameterized by the
transverse field $h$ forms a one-dimensional manifold. Information-geometric
analyses, particularly the Fisher information defined on this manifold,
successfully pinpoint the TFIM phase transition, regardless of the measuring
basis.

Abstract: Intertwining intrinsic topological order with gapless collective modes
remains a central challenge in many-body physics. We show that a quantum-Hall
trilayer at $\nu_{1}=\nu_{2}=\nu_{3}= \frac13$, tuned solely by the inter-layer
spacing $d$, realizes this goal. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) calculations and a Chern-Simons field theory analysis reveal an
intermediate ``anyon-exciton condensate'' separating the familiar
$\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=1$ exciton condensate ($d \to 0$) from three decoupled
Laughlin liquids ($d \to \infty$). In this phase, neutral bi-excitons condense
while a $\nu=\frac23$ Laughlin topological order survives, yielding a Goldstone
mode coexisting with fractionalized anyons. A Ginzburg-Landau analysis maps out
the finite-temperature phase diagram. The anyon-exciton condensate can be
experimentally verified through a vanishing double-counter-flow resistance and
a fractional layer-resolved Hall resistivity $R_{xy}=\frac{5}{2} h/e^{2}$, both
within reach of existing high-mobility trilayer devices.

Abstract: Near-term quantum processors are limited in terms of the number of qubits and
gates they can afford. They nevertheless give unprecedented access to
programmable quantum systems that can efficiently, although imperfectly,
simulate quantum time evolutions. Dynamical mean field theory, on the other
hand, maps strongly-correlated lattice models like the Hubbard model onto
simpler, yet still many-body models called impurity models. Its computational
bottleneck boils down to investigating the dynamics of the impurity upon
addition or removal of one particle. This task is notoriously difficult for
classical algorithms, which has warranted the development of specific classical
algorithms called "impurity solvers" that work well in some regimes, but still
struggle to reach some parameter regimes. In these lecture notes, we introduce
the tools and methods of quantum computing that could be used to overcome the
limitations of these classical impurity solvers, either in the long term --
with fully quantum algorithms, or in the short term -- with hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms.

Method: 使用强中红外脉冲诱导Sr2CuO3的Mott绝缘体-金属相变，并通过高次谐波光谱分析其动力学。

Result: 电场超过6 MV/cm时，谐波频率从奇数倍中红外频率偏移，表明电子结构重构。

Conclusion: 高次谐波光谱可用于揭示强关联材料中非平衡相变的亚周期动力学。

Abstract: Solids in an intense laser field show high-harmonic generation (HHG), which
can provide information on carrier dynamics and band structures in weakly
correlated systems. In strongly correlated systems, a laser field can induce a
transition between the various electronic phases formed by the entanglement of
charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom via carrier generation. The HHG
accompanying this process should contain information on the nonequilibrium
electronic-state dynamics along the oscillating field - an aspect that remains
unresolved to date. Here, we show that an intense mid-infrared (MIR) pulse
induces a Mott insulator-metal transition in a one-dimensional cuprate,
Sr2CuO3, the evolution of which is reflected by the spectral features of HHs.
When the electric-field amplitude exceeds 6 MV/cm, carriers are efficiently
generated and each harmonic frequency decreases from odd multiples of the MIR
frequency. Dynamical mean-field theory indicates that these redshifts originate
from a series of electronic-structure reconstructions in each electric-field
cycle during the melting of the Mott-insulator state, which modifies the
radiation phase from carrier recombination cycle-by-cycle. This phenomenon is
negligible in rigid-band systems. This experimental-theoretical study confirms
that HH spectroscopy research can potentially unravel the sub-cycle dynamics of
nonequilibrium phase transitions in correlated materials.

Abstract: Quantum geometry, which describes the geometry of Bloch wavefunctions in
solids, has become a cornerstone of modern quantum condensed matter physics.
The quantum geometrical tensor encodes this geometry through two fundamental
components: the quantum metric (real part) and the Berry curvature (imaginary
part). While the Berry curvature gained prominence through its manifestation in
the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, recent advances have revealed equally
significant effects arising from the quantum metric. This includes its
signatures in nonlinear transport, superfluid density of flat-band
superconductors, and nonlinear optical responses. These advances underscore how
quantum geometry is reshaping our understanding of condensed matter systems,
with far-reaching implications for future technologies. In this review, we
survey recent progress in the field, focusing on both foundational concepts and
emergent phenomena in transport and optics-with particular emphasis on the
pivotal role of the quantum metric.

Motivation: 探索Kagome金属YbV$_3$Sb$_4$中的量子现象，特别是拓扑与电子关联的相互作用。

Method: 采用密度泛函理论（DFT）结合Wannier函数分析，研究了SOC和U+SOC对电子态的影响。

Result: SOC和U+SOC显著改变Yb-4f态，V-3d态主导输运性质，费米面包含准二维圆柱形片和小口袋，dHvA频率高达70 kT。

Conclusion: YbV$_3$Sb$_4$是强拓扑金属，为研究Kagome晶格中的拓扑与电子关联提供了新平台。

Abstract: We have investigated the vanadium-based Kagome metal YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ using
density functional theory (DFT) combined with the Wannier function analysis. We
explore the electronic properties, de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect and Fermi
surface. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling SOC induces the splitting of
Yb-4f states, while its impact on the V-3d states is moderate. Furthermore, we
have incorporated SOC+U, where U being the Hubbard parameter, which drastically
changes the Yb-4f states creating additional splitting leading to three
distinct peaks in the density of states (DOS). The V-3d atoms with the Kagome
lattice contribute maximum to the transport properties, exhibits flat bands
near the EF while being protected under SOC and U+SOC. Herein, we report the
vulnerability of the Yb-4f states under SOC and U+SOC. Furthurmore, The Fermi
surface is found to comprise of quasi-2D cylindrical sheets centered at the
Gamma-point, along with smaller pockets near the Brillouin zone boundaries,
which under combined U+SOC, a small spherical pocket emerges and the
cylindrical sheet exhibits slight deformations. The dHvA frequencies reach as
high as 70 kilotesla, which increase with tilt angle, exhibiting a nearly
parabolic trend as expected for cylindrical orbits, while a low-frequency
branch remains below 1 kT. Only the U+SOC case shows noticeable modification in
both the Fermi surface and the dHvA oscillation. Crucially, the $Z_2$ invariant
calculation identifies YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ as a strong topological metal ($r_0 = 1$).
These findings not only advance our understanding of the underlying quantum
phenomena in rare-earth Kagome systems, but also establish YbV$_3$Sb$_4$ as a
compelling and promising platform for exploring intertwined topology and
electron correlations in kagome lattices, thereby offering valuable insights
for engineering quantum phases in layered materials.

Result: 证明了谱定位器与Chern和winding标记的等价性。

Conclusion: 提供了一种简化且易于理解的拓扑不变量分析方法，适用于更广泛的物理学者。

Abstract: Topological band insulators are classified using momentum-space topological
invariants, such as Chern or winding numbers, when they feature translational
symmetry. The lack of translation symmetry in disordered, quasicrystalline, or
amorphous topological systems has motivated alternative, real-space definitions
of topological invariants, including the local Chern marker and the spectral
localizer invariant.
  However, the equivalence between these invariants is so far implicit. Here,
we explicitly demonstrate their equivalence from a systematic perturbative
expansion in powers of the spectral localizer's parameter $\kappa$. By
leveraging only the Clifford algebra of the spectral localizer, we prove that
Chern and winding markers emerge as leading-order terms in the expansion. It
bypasses abstract topological machinery, offering a simple approach accessible
to a broader physics audience.

Abstract: We study the higher-order topological insulators at finite temperature based
on a generalized real-space quadrupole moment, which extends the ground state
expectations to ensemble averages. Our study reveals that chiral symmetry alone
dictates that the quadrupole moment must be quantized to two values of $0$ and
$1/2$, even at finite temperature. It is found that finite temperature can
induce a topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial. Furthermore,
we found that the anisotropic intra-cell hopping can lead to a reentrant
topological phase transition, in which the system becomes topological again
with rising temperature. This reentrant behavior is in stark contrast to the
results at zero temperature. We also investigate the effects of the
quasi-disorder hopping on the topology. It is found that the initially trivial
system can be driven into a topological phase with strong enough disorder
strength, which closely resembles the topological Anderson transition. Our work
provides an example for studying the finite temperature topology of
higher-order topological insulators.

Abstract: Quantum materials exhibiting phase transitions which can be controlled
through external stimuli, such as electric fields, are promising for future
computing technologies beyond conventional semiconductor transistors. Devices
that take advantage of structural phase transitions have inherent built-in
memory, reminiscent of synapses and neurons, and are thus natural candidates
for neuromorphic computing. Of particular interest are phase-change oxides,
which allow for control over the metal-to-insulator transition. Here, we report
X-ray nano-diffraction structural imaging of micro-devices fabricated with the
archetypal phase-change material vanadium sesquioxide (V$_2$O$_3$). The devices
contain a Ga ion-irradiated region where the metal-to-insulator transition
critical temperature is lowered, a useful feature for controlling neuron-like
spiking behavior. Results show that strain, induced by crystal lattice mismatch
between the pristine and irradiated material, leads to a suppression of the
metal-to-insulator-transition. Suppression occurs within the irradiated region
or along its edges, depending on the defect-distribution and the size of the
region. The observed self-straining effect could extend to other phase-change
oxides and dominate as device dimensions are reduced and become too small to
dissipate strain within the irradiated region. The findings are important for
phase engineering in phase-change devices and highlight the necessity to study
phase transitions at the nanoscale.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots leverage established
semiconductor infrastructure and offer a scalable path toward transformative
quantum technologies. Holes spins in silicon offer compact all-electrical
control, whilst retaining all the salient features of a quantum dot qubit
architecture. However, silicon hole spin qubits are not as advanced as
electrons, due to increased susceptibility to disorder and more complex spin
physics. Here we demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities up to 99.8% and a
two-qubit gate quality factor of 240, indicating a physical fidelity limit of
99.7%. These results represent the highest performance reported in natural
silicon to date, made possible by fast qubit control, exchange pulsing, and
industrial-grade fabrication. Notably, we achieve these results in a
near-identical device as used for highly reproducible, high-fidelity electron
spin qubits. With isotopic purification and device-level optimisations in the
future, our hole spin qubits are poised to unlock a new operation regime for
quantum CMOS architectures.

Abstract: We use the generalized Bloch theorem formalism of Alase {\it et al.} [{\it
Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 117} 076804 (2016)] to analyze simple one-dimensional
tight-binding lattice systems connected by Hermitian bonds (all with the same
hopping parameter $t$), but containing one bond impurity which can be either
Hermitian or non-Hermitian. We calculate the band structure, the bulk-boundary
correspondence indicator ($D_L(\epsilon)$) and analyze the eigenvalues of the
lattice translation operator ($z$), for each eigenstate. From the $z$ values
the generalized Brillouin zone can be reconstructed. If the impurity is
Hermitian (and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric), we find a parameter regime in which
two localized edge states separate from the tight-binding band. We then
simulate a non-Hermitian impurity by keeping hopping in one direction of the
bond impurity the same as the rest of the tight-binding system, and varying
only its reciprocal. Again, we find a region with localized edge states, but in
this case the energy eigenvalues are purely imaginary. We also find that in
this case the two zero energy eigenvectors coalesce, hence this system is an
exceptional line. We then perform an interpolative scan between the above two
scenarios and find that there is an intermediate region exhibiting a
non-Hermitian skin effect. In this region a macroscopic fraction of states
acquire complex energy eigenvalues and exhibit localization towards the
impurity. Our numerical results are supported by a detailed analysis of the
solutions of the boundary/impurity equation.

Abstract: Nonlinear optical phenomena such as parametric amplification and frequency
conversion are typically driven by external optical fields. Free electrons can
also act as electromagnetic sources, offering unmatched spatial precision.
Combining optical and electron-induced fields via the nonlinear response of
material structures therefore holds potential for revealing new physical
phenomena and enabling disruptive applications. Here, we theoretically
investigate wave mixing between external light and the evanescent fields of
free electrons, giving rise to inelastic photon scattering mediated by the
second-order nonlinear response of a specimen. Specifically, an incident photon
may be blue- or red-shifted, while the passing electron correspondingly loses
or gains energy. These processes are strongly enhanced when the frequency shift
matches an optical resonance of the specimen. We present a general theoretical
framework to quantify the photon conversion probability and demonstrate its
application by revealing far-infrared vibrational fingerprints of retinal using
only visible light. Beyond its fundamental interest, this phenomenon offers a
practical approach for spatially mapping low-frequency excitations with
nanometer resolution using visible photon energies and existing electron
microscopes.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to WSMs, but are
also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled
noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the
origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal
property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in
SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the
Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and
momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic
and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the
chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic
quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for
both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to
enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal,
but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt
in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a
magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into
weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial
directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external
magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing
the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be
tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.
