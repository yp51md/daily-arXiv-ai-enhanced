In this direction, space-time correlations between avalanches have proven to be especially difficult to access. One of the main obstacle to do so comes from taking memory effects in a systematic way along the computation. In this paper, we partially fill this gap and derive recursive relations for the particle filling and avalanche 2-points correlation function in the 1D Directed Stochastic Sandpile. These expressions allow to characterize the sign of the correlations and estimates are provided in the particle filling case. In fact, density correlations are shown to be positively correlated. This behavior is directly related to persistence of the local particle filling. On the other hand, we show that avalanches are anticorrelated in the model. This is interpreted by the fact that avalanches disrupt the system and the damage can only be fully compensated after injecting a sufficiently high number of particles. These results indicate an underlying trade off, between static and dynamic observable, for the system to sit in its stationary state. It appears that this balance is controlled by the conservation of the particle number along the avalanches."}

We introduce a model in which visible and hidden variables interact through two independently parametrized transition matrices, defining a Markov chain whose steady state is intrinsically out of equilibrium. Likelihood maximization drives this system toward nonequilibrium steady states with finite entropy production, reduced self-transition probabilities, and persistent probability currents in the latent space. These cycles are not imposed by the architecture but arise from training, and models that develop them avoid the low-log-likelihood regime associated with nearly reversible dynamics while more faithfully reproducing the empirical distribution of data classes. Compared with equilibrium approaches such as restricted Boltzmann machines, our model breaks the detailed balance between the forward and backward conditional transitions and relies on a log-likelihood gradient that depends explicitly on the last two steps of the Markov chain. Hence, this exploration of the interface between nonequilibrium statistical physics and modern machine learning suggests that introducing irreversibility into latent-variable models can enhance generative performance."}

In this work, we review its achievements up to the present moment, focusing on the practical aspects and discussing its limitations. First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems."}

For an open system described by the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF), we show that the equilibrium free energy difference between two canonical endpoints can be written as exponential averages of the HMF shift, divided by an explicit factor built from the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final system marginals. These relations hold at the endpoint level and, under an asymptotic equilibration postulate, admit trajectory representations for general driving and coupling protocols. A decomposition of the HMF increment along each trajectory separates the work-like contributions associated with changes in $λ(t)$ and $C(t)$, the heat-like exchange with the environment, and a feedback-like functional defined with respect to the initial protocol. In the frozen-driving regime with a noninteracting reference, the equalities reduce to new FEP-like expressions involving an environment functional and an explicit overlap correction, with the Zwanzig formula recovered as a limiting case. We validate the approach on an open system coupled to an environment and evolved under overdamped Langevin dynamics, where conventional Zwanzig FEP suffers from poor phase-space overlap and slow numerical convergence, while the present trajectory equality closely matches the exact free energy difference over a broad range of coupling strengths."}

Here we perform a systematic study by doping non-magnetic Mg2+ into a magnetically complicated system, Co10Ge3O16, which contains three frustrated sublattices of Co2+, e.g., triangular Co1, Kagome Co2 and Co3 sublattices. By growing crystals for (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 < x <= 30%), we observed obvious site preference of Mg2+ on Co1 and Co3 sites over the Co2 site. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the high purity of the samples and indicate systematic peak shift, consistent with the loading compositions. Although previously investigated, the magnetic structure and expected magnetic frustration in this system are not fully uncovered. Our temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that the high-temperature magnetostructural phase transition with antiferromagnetic ordering and a low-temperature broad peak are suppressed with Mg2+ doping, while two new magnetic features emerge at high Mg2+ level. Moreover, the structural phase transition from high-temperature R-3m to low-temperature C2/m space group is absent at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, as confirmed by single-crystal XRD. By analyzing the heat capacity and neutron powder diffraction results of the highest doped sample, (Co0.7Mg0.3)10Ge3O16, we speculate that the Co1 site is responsible for the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, while the other two sites are short-range correlated in addition to a Mg2+-induced spin-glass state. This study provides more insights into the complex magnetism in Co10Ge3O16 by using the non-magnetic Mg2+ as a probe. However, detailed magnetic structure requires further efforts on growing large single crystals."}

Although Shor's algorithm theoretically enables polynomial-time integer factorization, its real-world performance heavily depends on stringent conditions related to the period obtained via quantum phase estimation. Our generalized decomposition method relaxes these conditions by systematically exploiting arbitrary divisors of the obtained period, effectively broadening the applicability of each quantum execution. Extensive classical simulations were performed to empirically validate our approach, involving over one million test cases across integers ranging from 2 to 8 digits. The proposed method achieved near-perfect success rates, exceeding 99.998% for 7-digit numbers and 99.999% for 8-digit numbers, significantly surpassing traditional and recently improved variants of Shor's algorithm. Crucially, this improvement is achieved without compromising the algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and integrates seamlessly with existing quantum computational frameworks. Moreover, our method enhances the efficiency of quantum resource usage by minimizing unnecessary repetitions, making it particularly relevant for quantum cryptanalysis with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study thus provides both theoretical advancements and substantial practical benefits, contributing meaningfully to the field of quantum algorithm research and the broader field of quantum information processing."}

The magnetic field induces a linear phase gradient across the junction, generating Josephson vortices that can host low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs). We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the combined effect of the phase gradient and spin-orbit coupling stabilizes an odd-fermion parity ground state, where a single Josephson vortex binds a spinful low-energy degree of freedom that is energetically separated from the other ABSs. This low-energy degree of freedom can be exploited to define a special type of ASQ, which we dub the vortex spin qubit (VSQ). We show that single-qubit gates for VSQs can be performed via flux driving, while readout can be achieved by adapting standard circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques developed for conventional ASQs. We further outline how an entangling two-qubit gate can be performed using an ac current drive. We argue that VSQs offer prospects for a substantial reduction in device complexity and hardware overhead compared to conventional ASQ implementations, while preserving key advantages such as supercurrent-based readout, single-qubit gates, and long-range two-qubit gates."}

It also produces clear windows where the eigenstates become strongly multifractal. This shows that quasiperiodicity and geometry do not act independently rather, they reinforce one another in shaping the wavefunctions. Overall, we observe a smooth evolution of the states from extended, to multifractal, and finally to strongly localized. Our results pave the way for creating tunable quasiperiodic and geometry-driven localization effects in photonic waveguide arrays, ultracold atoms, mechanical metamaterials, and nanoscale platforms."}

This design enables independent control over the granule's effective temperature and spatial confinement. Our engine quantitatively reproduces the universal power-efficiency trade-offs of finite-time thermodynamics, achieving the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency at maximum power.

In recent years, methodological advancements led to the multiloop extension of the fRG, which systematically includes loop corrections beyond the conventional one-loop truncation and yields a quantitatively accurate description of two-dimensional lattice systems. At the same time, the single-boson exchange (SBE) decomposition of the two-particle vertex has been shown to offer both computational and interpretative advantages paving the way to more affordable approximation schemes. We here apply their combination coined as multiloop SBE fRG to the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling. After providing a detailed account of the underlying formalism in physical channels, we analyze the results for the frequency- and momentum-dependent vertex functions. We find that the SBE approximation, i.e., without calculating explicitly multi-boson exchange contributions, accurately reproduces the parquet approximation at loop convergence. The presented algorithmic improvement opens the route for the treatment of more challenging parameter regimes and more realistic models."}

We prove that there is no total algorithm that outputs this hitting time for all inputs; equivalently, the total UHTP is undecidable via a reduction from the halting problem. Operationally, we show a no-go theorem: for any fixed accuracy parameters, there is no universal finite-resource protocol that, for all computably described inputs, correctly outputs the hitting time while obeying uniform finite upper bounds on observation time and on dissipation/work. The proofs use reversible computation embedded into unitary dynamics, a fixed-target beacon construction, and a continuous-time lifting via piecewise-constant Hamiltonians. Our results target systems capable of embedding universal computation and complement prior undecidability results such as spectral-gap and quantum-control reachability.

Merging these, we generalize the notion of ideal Chern bands to the non-Hermitian realm and uncover several striking consequences both on the level of band theory and in the strongly interacting regime. Specifically, we show that the lowest band of a Kapit--Mueller lattice model with an imaginary gauge potential satisfies a generalized ideal condition with complex Berry curvature in sync with a complex quantum metric. The ideal band remains purely real and exactly flat yet all right and left eigenstates accumulate at the boundaries on a cylinder, implying a non-Hermitian skin effect without an accompanying spectral winding. The skin effect is inherited by the many-body zero modes, yielding skin-Laughlin states with an exponential profile on the lattice. Moreover, at a critical strength of non-Hermiticity there is an unconventional phase transition on the torus, which is absent on the cylinder. Our findings lead to an extension of topological order in non-Hermitian systems."}

QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order.

We employ this framework to analyze the reduced dynamics of a subsystem and to test whether local decoherence probes quantum chaos in many-body systems. Across paradigmatic spin chain models, we show that while the Choi echo captures key dynamical features, it also exhibits intrinsic limitations that, in certain regions of parameter space, restrict its ability to resolve the integrable-to-chaos transition at the level of spectral correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that local decoherence can spuriously signal quantum chaos in integrable regimes, tracing them to the inability of a strictly local probe to distinguish efficient coherent transport from genuinely scrambling dynamics. Our results show that local decoherence signals are controlled by the entanglement generated between the probe and its environment during the dynamics, rather than by spectral correlations, clarifying the practical scope of local dynamical diagnostics."}

The 2D ES is situated on a dielectric substrate near a perfectly conducting metal electrode (gate). The entire system is subjected to an external perpendicular constant magnetic field. We use Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves, while the electrons are described within the hydrodynamic approximation using Euler's equations and neglecting electromagnetic retardation effects. The incident electromagnetic wave excites magnetoplasmons in the strip. The fully screened limit is considered when all characteristic dimensions of the system, including the plasmon wavelengths, are much larger than the distance to the gate. This limit allows the linear response to be determined fully analytically. Due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic (convective) term, the excited magnetoplasmon oscillations give rise to a DC current along the strip and a voltage across it. Surprisingly, the relationship between the photocurrent and the photovoltage in resonance is exactly the same as in the classical Hall effect. The photovoltage is a monotonic function of the magnetic field. However, the photocurrent exhibits a minimum, which occurs at specific wavevector directions."}

We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order. Our findings indicate that scar subspaces can inherit -- and in inhomogeneous cases systematically modify -- the topological character of the SPT ground state, offering a new and experimentally accessible platform for probing symmetry-protected topology beyond the ground-state regime."}

We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states."}

Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials."}

CrSb belongs to a new class of altermagnetic materials, the small net magnetization is accompanied by alternating spin splitting in the k-space. In addition, CrSb reveals also topological features with Weyl surface states originating from bulk band topology. We observe, that $M(α)$ oscillates around zero value, so magnetization is positive for $M(α)$ maxima and it is negative for $M(α)$ minima. The magnetization reversal curves $M(H)$ are non-linear with low-field hysteresis, but with almost linear high-field branches. The slope of the linear branches well correlates with $M(α)$ oscillations, so it is positive for $M(α)$ maxima and negative for $M(α)$ minima. We demonstrate, that the interplay between the positive and the negative $M(H)$ slopes originates from several magnetic phases in CrSb. In particular, current-carrying topological surface states are responsible for the diamagnetic-like $M(H)$ negative slope, which dominates for the directions of full spin compensation in the bulk CrSb altermagnetic spectrum. Due to the spin-momentum locking, topological surface states are spin-polarized, which is responsible for the low-field hysteresis. Thus, we experimentally demonstrate both the altermagnetic bulk and the topological surface magnetizations for the altermagnetic candidate CrSb."}

Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations."}

We consider the ramped and periodically-driven Falicov-Kimball and Hubbard models within time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory. Although we observe that several iterative methods yield stable convergence at large propagation times, a standard forward fixed point iteration does not. We find that the number of iterations required to converge to a given accuracy with a fixed time step size scales roughly linearly with the number of time steps. This scaling is associated with the formation of a propagating front in the residual error, whose velocity is method-dependent. We identify key challenges which must be addressed in order to make global solvers competitive with time-stepping methods."}

Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems. Together, these results provide conceptual practical tools to study how bipartite correlations and entanglement are structured and where they can be found in complex Gaussian many-body systems."}

Despite these complementary advances, an integrated understanding of electronic and phononic dynamics, self-organized chiral structures, and their interplay is still lacking. Such an integrated framework is crucial both for elucidating the spontaneous formation and stabilization of chiral structures and for advancing the electronic functionalities of chiral materials. Here, we predict novel spontaneous structural phase transitions unique to chiral crystals with screw symmetry. In quasi-one-dimensional chiral crystals, the phonon frequency renormalized by the electron-phonon coupling depends on the handedness of circular polarization. Consequently, the soft mode encoding the intrinsic phonon angular momentum induces spin-selective Peierls gaps in the electronic band, entailing a helical spin density wave and chiral lattice distortion.

In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\\mathbf{q}\\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state."}

However, at ultrashort length and time scales, where quantum correlations become significant, these models inevitably break down. While numerous methods exist to simulate quantum many-body spin systems, they are often limited to near-equilibrium conditions, capture only short-time dynamics, or obscure the intuitive connection between nonlinear behavior and its geometric origin in the su(2) spin algebra. To advance nonlinear magnetism into the quantum regime, we develop a theory in which semiclassical spin correlations, rather than individual spins, serve as the fundamental dynamical variables. Defined on the bonds of a bipartite lattice, these correlations are inherently nonlocal, with dynamics following through a semiclassical mapping that preserves the original spin algebra. The resulting semiclassical theory captures nonlinear dynamics that are entirely nonclassical and naturally accommodates phenomenological damping at the level of correlations, which is typically challenging to include in quantum methods. As an application, we focus on Heisenberg antiferromagnets, which feature significant quantum effects. We predict nonlinear scaling of the mean frequency of quantum oscillations in the Néel state with the spin quantum number S. These have no classical analog and exhibit features reminiscent of nonlinear parametric resonance, fully confirmed by exact diagonalization. The predicted dynamical features are embedded in the geometric structure of the semiclassical phase space of spin correlations, making their physical origin much more transparent than in full quantum methods. With this, semiclassical spin-correlation dynamics provide a foundation for exploring nonlinear quantum magnetism."}

In the quantum regime, these reorganizations are often blurred by density-matrix averaging, and spectral indicators such as the Liouvillian gap can miss changes that unfold mainly in the transients. Here we introduce a topological graph invariant, the molecule, which captures the phase-space connectivity of fixed points and limit cycles. Transitions show up as discrete changes of this invariant, with each form marking a distinct quantum dynamical pattern (e.g. relaxation pathway). The molecule encodes the global topological constraints that govern how stationary sets and their basins can rearrange, clarifies when such rearrangements can affect the Liouvillian modes, and reveals additional transitions that remain hidden in the steady-state spectrum but stem from global changes of the flow topology.

We benchmark four approaches, Local-Global, Adiabatic, State Efficient Ansatz (SEA), and Pretrained VQE, against standard VQE on molecular systems from 4 to 14 qubits, analyzing gradient variance up to 50 layers and convergence over 1000 iterations. Our results show that the impact of gradient preservation is iteration-dependent. In the 14-qubit BeH2 system, Pretrained VQE outperforms SEA at 100 iterations despite lower gradient variance, but SEA becomes 2.2x more accurate at 1000 iterations. For smaller systems, SEA achieves near-exact energies (H2: 10^-5 Ha, LiH: 2x10^-4 Ha) with fidelities 0.999, while standard methods plateau early.

Specifically, we show that the lowest band of a Kapit--Mueller lattice model with an imaginary gauge potential satisfies a generalized ideal condition with complex Berry curvature in sync with a complex quantum metric. The ideal band remains purely real and exactly flat yet all right and left eigenstates accumulate at the boundaries on a cylinder, implying a non-Hermitian skin effect without an accompanying spectral winding. The skin effect is inherited by the many-body zero modes, yielding skin-Laughlin states with an exponential profile on the lattice. Moreover, at a critical strength of non-Hermiticity there is an unconventional phase transition on the torus, which is absent on the cylinder.

The evolution governed by the Liouville operator preserves many properties of full quantum dynamics, including the conservation of total population, energy, and purity, and has shown quantitative agreement with exact quantum results for the expectation values of many observables where direct comparisons are feasible. However, since the QCLE density matrix operator is obtained from the partial Wigner transform of the full quantum density matrix, its matrix elements can have negative values, implying that the diagonal matrix elements behave as pseudo-densities rather than densities of classical phase space. Here, we compare phase-space distributions generated by exact quantum dynamics with those produced by QCLE evolution from pure quantum initial states. We show that resonance effects in the off-diagonal matrix elements differ qualitatively, particularly for low-energy states. Furthermore, numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models reveal that the QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, a property that should hold at all times for any physical system. A perturbative analysis of a model system confirms that such violations arise generically. We also show that the violations of positivity of the marginal densities vanish as the initial energy of the system increases relative to the energy gap between subsystem states. These findings suggest that a negativity index, quantifying deviations from positivity, may provide a useful metric for assessing the validity of mixed quantum\\textendash{}classical descriptions."}

Here, we first investigate the tradeoff relations between accessible information and guessing probability in the binary case, thus disproving the claimed monotonicity of the former quantity in the latter that, if true, would have settled Shor's problem in the qubit case. Our second result is to provide a state-dependent generalization of extremality for quantum measurements, to characterize state-dependent extremality for qubit dichotomies, and to apply such results to tighten previous results on the accessible information of qubit dichotomies."}

To address this issue, techniques from the field of quantum error mitigation use information about the noise to improve measurement results. We present a novel mitigation technique for quantum sensors to efficiently reverse the effects of any noise that can be described by a completely positive trace preserving map. The method leverages the knowledge acquired by a pre-characterization step of the device to automatically adapt to the complexity of the dissipative evolution and to indicate optimal sensing times $τ$ to achieve the most accurate results.

However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($Δt$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $Δt$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $ε\\to 0$ of the error parameter $ε$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $ε\\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($ε^2$) vs O($Δt$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $ε$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $ε$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage."}

However, the practical use of the Earth's magnetic field for geo-localization hinges on an ultra-sensitive magnetometer. This work investigates how quantum magnetic sensing can be used for this purpose. We theoretically derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the estimation error of quantum sensing when using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and prove the quantum advantage over classical magnetometers. Moreover, we employ a practical distributed quantum sensing protocol to saturate CRLB. Based on the estimated magnetic field and the earth's magnetic field map, we formulate geo-localization as a map-matching problem and introduce a coarse-to-fine Mahalanobis distance search in both gradient space (local field derivatives) and corner space (raw field samples). We simulate the proposed quantum sensing-based geo-localization framework over four cities in the United States and Canada. The results report that in high-gradient regions, gradient-space Mahalanobis search achieves sub-kilometer median localization error; while in magnetically smoother areas, corner-space search provides better accuracy and a $4-8\\times$ reduction in runtime."}

We provide a no-go result showing that the cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient in the number of rounds and secure.

We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips.

By combining quantum speed limits with the mass energy equivalence of special relativity, we show that spatial localizability and temporal resolution are not independent: sharpening one inevitably blurs the other. Specifically, the internal energy coherence needed for precise timekeeping affects the center of mass dynamics, enhancing position spreading during free evolution. As a result, a single composite system cannot act as a perfect quantum reference frame for both space and time, leading to a Heisenberg like uncertainty relation between spatial and temporal intervals. After analyzing this trade off from an external perspective, we formulate it in a purely relational manner, by means of covariant observables relative to the space time quantum reference frame, uncovering an additional intrinsic uncertainty of order the Compton wavelength of the frame."}

In this paper, we explore these local encodings from the perspective of the corresponding time-evolution unitaries. Specifically, we propose a new framework for digital implementations of these qubit-encoded fermionic time-evolution unitaries based on \\emph{flow sets}, which are one-dimensional subsets of the directed fermionic interaction graph. We find that any local fermionic encoding, when restricted to a given flow set, adopts a simple structure that we can classify systematically. For each categorized flow-set form, we propose a low-depth qubit quantum circuit that implements the time evolution unitary using the stabilizer formalism. As an application of our construction, we introduce novel flow-based decompositions for known two-dimensional encodings, leading to efficient circuit decompositions of time-evolution unitaries. We generally observe a space-time trade-off, where mappings with larger qubit-to-fermion ratios yield shallower time-evolution quantum circuits."}

Under such double coupling, it is found that while the Hamiltonian of the system is clearly Hermitian the dynamics of the quadrature components of the field operators can be attributed to non-Hermicity of the system. It is manifested in an asymmetric coupling between the quadrature components which then leads to a variety of remarkable features. In particular, we identify how the emerging exceptional point controls the conversion of thermal states of the modes into single-mode classically or quantum squeezed states. Furthermore, for reservoirs being in squeezed states, we find that the two-photon correlations present in these reservoirs are responsible for unidirectional flow of populations and correlations among the modes and the flow can be controlled by appropriate tuning of the mutual orientation of the squeezed noise ellipses. In the course of analyzing these effects we find that the flow of the population creates the first-order coherence between the modes which, on the other hand rules out an enhancement of the two photon correlations responsible for entanglement between the modes. These results suggest new alternatives for the creation of single mode squeezed fields and the potential applications for controlled unidirectional transfer of population and correlations in bosonic chains."}

When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \\textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state. These results highlight the potential of continuously-coupled photonic systems to harness high-dimensional entanglement within compact architectures."}

A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems."}

Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself.

However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($Δt$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $Δt$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $ε\\to 0$ of the error parameter $ε$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $ε\\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($ε^2$) vs O($Δt$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $ε$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $ε$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage."}

Sau"], "title": "Andreev spin qubits bound to Josephson vortices in spin-orbit coupled planar Josephson junctions", "comment": null, "summary": "We propose a variant of Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) defined in planar Josephson junctions based on spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in a weak out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetic field induces a linear phase gradient across the junction, generating Josephson vortices that can host low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs). We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the combined effect of the phase gradient and spin-orbit coupling stabilizes an odd-fermion parity ground state, where a single Josephson vortex binds a spinful low-energy degree of freedom that is energetically separated from the other ABSs. This low-energy degree of freedom can be exploited to define a special type of ASQ, which we dub the vortex spin qubit (VSQ). We show that single-qubit gates for VSQs can be performed via flux driving, while readout can be achieved by adapting standard circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques developed for conventional ASQs. We further outline how an entangling two-qubit gate can be performed using an ac current drive. We argue that VSQs offer prospects for a substantial reduction in device complexity and hardware overhead compared to conventional ASQ implementations, while preserving key advantages such as supercurrent-based readout, single-qubit gates, and long-range two-qubit gates."}

Bergholtz"], "title": "Topological Order and Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Generalized Ideal Chern Bands", "comment": null, "summary": "Fractionalization in ideal Chern bands and non-Hermitian topological physics are two active but so far separate research directions. Merging these, we generalize the notion of ideal Chern bands to the non-Hermitian realm and uncover several striking consequences both on the level of band theory and in the strongly interacting regime. Specifically, we show that the lowest band of a Kapit--Mueller lattice model with an imaginary gauge potential satisfies a generalized ideal condition with complex Berry curvature in sync with a complex quantum metric. The ideal band remains purely real and exactly flat yet all right and left eigenstates accumulate at the boundaries on a cylinder, implying a non-Hermitian skin effect without an accompanying spectral winding. The skin effect is inherited by the many-body zero modes, yielding skin-Laughlin states with an exponential profile on the lattice. Moreover, at a critical strength of non-Hermiticity there is an unconventional phase transition on the torus, which is absent on the cylinder. Our findings lead to an extension of topological order in non-Hermitian systems."}

The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension."}

We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order. Our findings indicate that scar subspaces can inherit -- and in inhomogeneous cases systematically modify -- the topological character of the SPT ground state, offering a new and experimentally accessible platform for probing symmetry-protected topology beyond the ground-state regime."}

Mentink"], "title": "Spin-correlation dynamics: A semiclassical framework for nonlinear quantum magnetism", "comment": null, "summary": "Classical nonlinear theories are highly successful in describing far-from-equilibrium dynamics of magnets, encompassing phenomena such as parametric resonance, ultrafast switching, and even chaos. However, at ultrashort length and time scales, where quantum correlations become significant, these models inevitably break down. While numerous methods exist to simulate quantum many-body spin systems, they are often limited to near-equilibrium conditions, capture only short-time dynamics, or obscure the intuitive connection between nonlinear behavior and its geometric origin in the su(2) spin algebra. To advance nonlinear magnetism into the quantum regime, we develop a theory in which semiclassical spin correlations, rather than individual spins, serve as the fundamental dynamical variables. Defined on the bonds of a bipartite lattice, these correlations are inherently nonlocal, with dynamics following through a semiclassical mapping that preserves the original spin algebra. The resulting semiclassical theory captures nonlinear dynamics that are entirely nonclassical and naturally accommodates phenomenological damping at the level of correlations, which is typically challenging to include in quantum methods. As an application, we focus on Heisenberg antiferromagnets, which feature significant quantum effects. We predict nonlinear scaling of the mean frequency of quantum oscillations in the Néel state with the spin quantum number S. These have no classical analog and exhibit features reminiscent of nonlinear parametric resonance, fully confirmed by exact diagonalization. The predicted dynamical features are embedded in the geometric structure of the semiclassical phase space of spin correlations, making their physical origin much more transparent than in full quantum methods. With this, semiclassical spin-correlation dynamics provide a foundation for exploring nonlinear quantum magnetism."}
