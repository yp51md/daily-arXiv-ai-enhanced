In this way, we can\nunambiguously discriminate between transitions at minimum dissipation between\ngenuine equilibrium states, and transitions at minimum work driving a system\nfrom a genuine equilibrium to a non-equilibrium state. For underdamped dynamics\nsubject to a mechanical force, genuine equilibrium means a Maxwell-Boltzmann\nprobability distribution defining a vanishing current velocity. Transitions at\nminimum dissipation between equilibria are a model of optimal swift engineered\nequilibration. Remarkably, we show that transitions at minimum work do not\ndirectly imply explicit boundary conditions on terminal values of parameters of\nthe mechanical force and on control protocols. Thus, the problem often\ndiscussed in the literature, that optimal protocols need terminal jumps to\nsatisfy boundary conditions, completely disappears. The quantitative properties\nof optimal controls are entirely determined by the form of the penalty\nmodelling an experimental setup. More generally, we use centre manifold theory\nto analytically account for the tendency of optimal controls to exhibit a\nturnpike property: optimal protocols in the bulk of the control horizon tend to\nconverge to a universal centre manifold determined only by the running cost.\nExponential deviations from the centre manifold occur at the ends of the\ncontrol horizon in order to satisfy the boundary conditions.

Here we investigate the spatial\nstructure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\\em\nopen} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type\nand time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian\nregime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum\nsystems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the\ntime-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine\nmultipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin\ncorrelators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In\nparticular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in\nthe Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as\nalso discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to\nKitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson\nloop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory\neffects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also\nacquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian\ndynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening\navenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering."}

In a two-dimensional electronic\nsystem, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons\ncondense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This\nordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic\nscale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and\nmoire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be\nformed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying\nvoltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole\ndensity by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For\ndensities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes\nindividual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By\nincreasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi\nliquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which\nindicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be\nformed within a narrow effective density range.

Application of external magnetic\nfields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered\nphases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak\ncoupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been\nproposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to\nfeature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the\nzero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific\nfamily of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite\nvalue in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis\n(arXiv:2501.18591). Here, we predict that a confluence of external magnetic\nfields and such a non-Hermiticity can amplify the magnitude of commuting class\nmasses for subcritical strengths of interactions in Dirac liquids, an emergent\nphenomenon named non-Hermitian amplification of magnetic catalysis.

Here we investigate the\nelectronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature\nCommunications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed\nthrough molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory\n(DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with\nexponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT\nresults with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly\nconstant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with\nexperimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized\nby distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we\nanalyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the\none-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental\ndata, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in\ncarbon nanodevices."}

Romero"], "title": "Quantum gates in coupled quantum dots controlled by coupling modulation", "comment": "22 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "We studied the dynamics of a pair of single-electron double quantum dots\n(DQD) under longitudinal and transverse static magnetic fields and\ntime-dependent harmonic modulation of their interaction couplings. We propose\nto modulate the tunnel coupling between the QDs to produce one-qubit gates and\nthe exchange coupling between DQDs to generate entangling gates, the set of\noperations required for quantum computing. We developed analytical\napproximations to set the conditions to control the qubits and applied them to\nnumerical calculations to test the accuracy and robustness of the analytical\nmodel. The results shows that the unitary evolution of the two-electron state\nperforms the designed operations even under conditions shifted from the ideal\nones."}
