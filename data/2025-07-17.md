### [2] [Visualising Quantum Product Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11577)
*Tom Scruby*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了超图积（HGP）代码的图形化方法，并将其推广到提升积和平衡积，通过三维视角提供直观理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超图积代码的图形化方法虽然直观，但缺乏对提升积和平衡积的统一描述，需要一种更通用的图形化方法。

Method: 通过引入第三维度，将图形化方法推广到提升积和平衡积，分析其性质。

Result: 提供了对提升积和平衡积的直观理解，解释了其性质（如k和d的界定困难、逻辑基问题）及两者关系。

Conclusion: 三维图形化方法为理解提升积和平衡积提供了统一框架，直观且严谨。

Abstract: The hypergraph product (HGP) is a famous code construction technique with an
equally famous canonical visualisation. This visual perspective provides much
more than simply a way to build intuition: HGP codes can be defined
graphically, properties can be demonstrated graphically, and approaches to
fault-tolerant logic have been developed graphically. In recent years two
powerful generalisations of this product -- the lifted and balanced products --
have been proposed and employed to great success, but a unified graphical
approach to describing these codes has been absent. In these notes I review the
canonical approach to visualising HGP codes and then show how, via the addition
of a third dimension, it can be generalised to apply to both the lifted and the
balanced product. In the process we obtain clear intuition into various
properties of these codes such as i) why it is hard to bound $k$ and $d$ ii)
the issues with finding a canonical logical basis in the general case and iii)
how the two products are related, and how they differ. I have attempted to
structure these notes plainly and directly, so that the visual intuition can be
easily obtained by those who want it while the rigorous justification is still
available to those who demand it.

### [3] [k-Contextuality as a Heuristic for Memory Separations in Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11604)
*Mariesa H. Teo,Willers Yang,James Sud,Teague Tomesh,Frederic T. Chong,Eric R. Anschuetz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的上下文相关性度量——强k-上下文性，证明其在经典流模型中无法用少于k个隐状态表示，而量子生成模型不受此限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典机器学习模型在处理长程相关性数据时表现不佳，尤其是量子启发的序列分布。研究旨在量化这种上下文相关性，并探索量子模型的优势。

Method: 定义了强k-上下文性，并开发了高效算法来估计序列数据中的这种度量。

Result: 强k-上下文性是经典模型难以处理但量子模型可能高效解决问题的指标。

Conclusion: 强k-上下文性可作为识别经典计算困难但量子计算可能高效的问题的工具。

Abstract: Classical machine learning models struggle with learning and prediction tasks
on data sets exhibiting long-range correlations. Previously, the existence of a
long-range correlational structure known as contextuality was shown to inhibit
efficient classical machine learning representations of certain
quantum-inspired sequential distributions. Here, we define a new quantifier of
contextuality we call strong k-contextuality, and prove that any translation
task exhibiting strong k-contextuality is unable to be represented to finite
relative entropy by a classical streaming model with fewer than k latent
states. Importantly, this correlation measure does not induce a similar
resource lower bound for quantum generative models. Using this theory as
motivation, we develop efficient algorithms which estimate our new measure of
contextuality in sequential data, and empirically show that this estimate is a
good predictor for the difference in performance of resource-constrained
classical and quantum Bayesian networks in modeling the data. Strong
k-contextuality thus emerges as a measure to help identify problems that are
difficult for classical computers, but may not be for quantum computers.

### [4] [Rise and fall of nonstabilizerness via random measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11619)
*Annarita Scocco,Wai-Keong Mok,Leandro Aolita,Mario Collura,Tobias Haug*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了在随机Clifford幺正算符和局域投影测量组成的量子电路中非稳定性的动力学。发现计算基测量下非稳定性以量子化步骤衰减，而旋转非Clifford基测量下会达到稳态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子计算中非稳定性的动态行为及其与测量的关系，揭示Clifford操作对非稳定性的保护作用。

Method: 通过随机Clifford幺正算符和局域投影测量构建量子电路，分析计算基和旋转非Clifford基测量下的非稳定性动力学。

Result: 计算基测量下非稳定性需指数级测量次数才能消失；旋转非Clifford基测量下会达到稳态。Haar随机态快速平衡，稳定态则线性弛豫。

Conclusion: 揭示了粗粒度和细粒度非稳定性诊断的差异，展示了测量如何抑制和维持量子计算资源。

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in
monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local
projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive
an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it
decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to
vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the
other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases,
measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics
leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the
initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time,
whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the
stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer R\'enyi
Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover
sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness
diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain
quantum computational resources.

### [5] [Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in a Disordered XX Spin Chain: A Real-Space Renormalization Group Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11957)
*Siddharth Tiwary,Joel E. Moore*

TL;DR: 研究了带有随机测量的无序XX自旋链，提出了一种适用于开放系统的RSRG-X方法，揭示了非幺正性导致的新固定点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索随机测量与幺正动力学相互作用在无序自旋链中的新相和相变。

Method: 通过将监测链映射到具有复耦合的非厄米自旋梯子，提出RSRG-X方法。

Result: 发现了一类由非幺正性引起的强无序固定点。

Conclusion: 扩展了RSRG可访问的临界现象范围。

Abstract: Spin chains with quenched disorder exhibit rich critical behavior, often
captured by real-space renormalization group (RSRG) techniques. However, the
physics of such systems in the presence of random measurements (i.e.,
non-Hermitian dephasing) remains largely unexplored. The interplay between
measurements and unitary dynamics gives rise to novel phases and phase
transitions in monitored quantum systems. In this work, we investigate the
disordered XX spin chain subject to stochastic local measurements in the $X$
and $Y$ bases. By mapping the monitored chain to a non-Hermitian spin ladder
with complex couplings, we propose an RSRG-for-excited-states (RSRG-X) approach
for this open-system setting. Our analysis reveals a new class of strongly
disordered fixed points that emerge due to non-unitarity, broadening the
landscape of critical phenomena accessible via RSRG.

### [6] [Dynamics Simulation of Arbitrary Non-Hermitian Systems Based on Quantum Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11675)

Result: 成功应用于开放量子系统的动态模拟，取得预期结果。

Conclusion: 该算法适用性强，有望模拟多种非厄米系统。

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit unique properties and hold significant
promise for diverse applications, yet their dynamical simulation poses a
particular challenge due to intrinsic openness and non-unitary evolution. Here,
we introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm based on Quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC) for simulating the dynamics of arbitrary time-dependent non-Hermitian
systems. Notably, this approach constitutes a natural extension of the quantum
imaginary-time evolution (QITE) algorithm. This algorithm combines the
advantages of both classical and quantum computation and exhibits good
applicability and adaptability, making it promising for simulating arbitrary
non-Hermitian systems such as PT-symmetric systems, non-physical processes, and
open quantum systems. To validate the algorithm, we applied it to the dynamic
simulation of open quantum systems and achieved the desired results.

### [7] [Mobility rings in a non-Hermitian non-Abelian quasiperiodic lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12176)
*Rui-Jie Chen,Guo-Qing Zhang,Zhi Li,Dan-Wei Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究自旋1/2非互易Aubry-André链中SU(2)非阿贝尔人工规范场的局域化和拓扑性质，发现非阿贝尔情况下会出现迁移环，伴随非厄米拓扑相变。

Motivation: 探索非阿贝尔规范场对局域化和拓扑性质的影响，特别是与阿贝尔情况的差异。

Method: 结合解析和数值方法，研究迁移环的拓扑性质，并通过逆参与率、归一化参与率等指标验证。

Result: 在复能量平面上，迁移环将局域态与扩展态分离，数值结果与解析表达式一致。

Conclusion: 非阿贝尔规范场下迁移环的出现揭示了新的拓扑现象，为理解非厄米系统中的局域化提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study localization and topological properties in spin-1/2 non-reciprocal
Aubry-Andr\'{e} chain with SU(2) non-Abelian artificial gauge fields. The
results reveal that, different from the Abelian case, mobility rings, will
emerge in the non-Abelian case accompanied by the non-Hermitian topological
phase transition. As the non-Hermitian extension of mobility edges, such
mobility rings separate Anderson localized eigenstates from extended
eigenstates in the complex energy plane under the periodic boundary condition.
Based on the topological properties, we obtain the exact expression of the
mobility rings. Furthermore, the corresponding indicators such as inverse
participation rate, normalized participation ratio, winding number,
non-Hermitian spectral structures and wave functions are numerically studied.
The numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical expression,
which confirms the emergence of mobility rings.

### [8] [Notions of Adiabatic Drift in the Quantized Harper model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11696)
*Alice C. Quillen,Nathan Skerrett,Damian R. Sowinski,Abobakar Sediq Miakhel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了有限几乎Mathieu算子的量子化离散漂移版本，发现其能级间距跨越多个数量级，且参数缓慢变化时存在绝热和非绝热跃迁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索与经典谐振动力学系统相关的量子系统的能级间距和跃迁特性。

Method: 分析有限几乎Mathieu算子的能级间距和参数变化时的跃迁行为。

Result: 能级间距跨越多个数量级，参数变化时存在绝热和非绝热跃迁。

Conclusion: 这种能级间距的广泛范围可能是与经典谐振动力学系统相关的量子系统的共同特性。

Abstract: We study a quantized, discrete and drifting version of the Harper
Hamiltonian, also called the finite almost Mathieu operator, which resembles
the pendulum Hamiltonian but in phase space is confined to a torus. Spacing
between pairs of eigenvalues of the operator spans many orders of magnitude,
with nearly degenerate pairs of states at energies that are associated with
circulating orbits in the associated classical system. When parameters of the
system slowly vary, both adiabatic and diabatic transitions can take place at
drift rates that span many orders of magnitude. Only under an extremely
negligible drift rate would all transitions into superposition states be
suppressed. The wide range of energy level spacings could be a common property
of quantum systems with non-local potentials that are related to resonant
classical dynamical systems. Notions for adiabatic drift are discussed for
quantum systems that are associated with classical ones with divided phase
space.

### [9] [Time-Aware Qubit Assignment and Circuit Optimization for Distributed Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11707)
*Leo Sünkel,Jonas Stein,Maximilian Zorn,Thomas Gabor,Claudia Linnhoff-Popien*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了分布式量子计算中的通信成本优化问题，提出了两种方法：基于时间感知的算法和进化算法，以减少量子通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式量子计算是扩展量子计算规模的一种潜在解决方案，但其实现面临软件和算法方面的挑战，尤其是如何高效分配量子比特以减少通信成本。

Method: 1. 应用时间感知算法，考虑电路动态连接性和网络拓扑；2. 提出基于进化的量子电路优化算法，直接调整电路结构以减少通信开销。

Result: 两种进化算法在减少通信成本方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 论文为分布式量子计算的编译框架提供了优化思路，未来可进一步集成这些方法。

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of distributed quantum computing promises a potential
solution to scaling quantum computing to currently unfeasible dimensions. While
this approach itself is still in its infancy, and many obstacles must still be
overcome before its physical implementation, challenges from the software and
algorithmic side must also be identified and addressed. For instance, this
paradigm shift requires a new form of compiler that considers the network
constraints in general as well as phenomena arising due to the nature of
quantum communication. In distributed quantum computing, large circuits are
divided into smaller subcircuits such that they can be executed individually
and simultaneously on multiple QPUs that are connected through quantum
channels. As quantum communication, for example, in the form of teleportation,
is expensive, it must be used sparingly. We address the problem of assigning
qubits to QPUs to minimize communication costs in two different ways. First by
applying time-aware algorithms that take into account the changing connectivity
of a given circuit as well as the underlying network topology. We define the
optimization problem, use simulated annealing and an evolutionary algorithm and
compare the results to graph partitioning and sequential qubit assignment
baselines. In another approach, we propose an evolutionary-based quantum
circuit optimization algorithm that adjusts the circuit itself rather than the
schedule to reduce the overall communication cost. We evaluate the techniques
against random circuits and different network topologies. Both evolutionary
algorithms outperform the baseline in terms of communication cost reduction. We
give an outlook on how the approaches can be integrated into a compilation
framework for distributed quantum computing.

### [10] [Separation of relaxation timescales via strong system-bath coupling: Dissipative three-level system as a case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11712)
*Brett Min,Matthew Gerry,Dvira Segal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 强系统-浴耦合将耗散量子系统的弛豫动力学分为两个阶段：短时加速和长时延缓。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强耦合下量子系统的弛豫动力学特性及其潜在应用。

Method: 使用反应坐标极化子变换映射，分析弛豫时间尺度。

Result: 强耦合可自主生成并维持长寿命量子相干性。

Conclusion: 强耦合为量子态制备提供了新策略。

Abstract: We analytically demonstrate that strong system-bath coupling separates the
relaxation dynamics of a dissipative quantum system into two distinct regimes:
a short-time dynamics that, as expected, accelerates with increasing coupling
to the environment, and a slow dynamics that, counterintuitively, becomes
increasingly prolonged at sufficiently strong coupling. Using the
reaction-coordinate polaron-transform mapping, we uncover the general mechanism
behind this effect and derive accurate expressions for both relaxation
timescales. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical predictions. From a
practical perspective, our results suggest that strong coupling to a
dissipative bath can autonomously generate and sustain long-lived quantum
coherences, offering a promising strategy for bath-engineered quantum state
preparation.

Motivation: 研究Koopman经典系统与量子比特耦合的动力学行为，探索其在混合量子-经典系统中的表现及其对量子引力理论的影响。

Method: 将Koopman经典系统与两个量子比特耦合，分析其动力学行为，并验证是否违反守恒定律。

Result: 尽管系统采用全量子形式描述，但复合系统违反了守恒定律，且两个量子比特间无法产生纠缠。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了混合量子-经典系统的局限性，对半经典量子引力理论提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: We present a method for coupling a Koopmanian classical system to two quantum
bits to mediate an interaction between them. We then prove that the resulting
dynamics can never lead to entanglement between the two qubits. Even though the
total system of two qubits and the Koopmanian classical system are described
with the full quantum formalism, we show that their composite system violates
exact conservation laws as expected for a hybrid quantum-classical system. We
finally discuss the implications for semi-classical treatments of quantum
gravity.

### [12] [Non-additive measures for quantum probability?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11735)
*Gabriele Carcassi,Christine A. Aidala*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文探讨了量子力学中非加性测度的必要性及其在概率计算中的潜在应用，提出了一个开放性问题：如何扩展概率计算以包含非加性测度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子力学中的状态计数测度是非加性的，这与经典力学的加性测度不同。本文旨在探讨如何扩展概率计算以适应这种非加性测度。

Conclusion: 本文提出了量子力学中非加性测度的研究框架，希望引发相关领域的讨论，以推动概率计算的扩展。

Abstract: It is well-established that quantum probability does not follow classical
Kolmogorov probability calculus. Various approaches have been developed to
loosen the axioms, of which the use of signed measures is the most successful
(e.g. the Wigner quasiprobability distribution). As part of our larger effort
Assumptions of Physics, we have been considering the various roles of measures,
which are used in physics not only for probability, but also to quantify the
count of possible states and configurations. These measures play a crucial role
in classical mechanics, as they effectively define its geometric structure. If
one tries to construct a parallel in quantum mechanics, the measure to quantify
the count of states turns out to be non-additive. The proper extension of
probability calculus may require the use of non-additive measures, which is
something that, to our knowledge, has not yet been explored. The purpose of
this paper is to present the general idea and the open problems to an audience
that is knowledgeable of the subject of non-additive set functions, though not
necessarily in quantum physics, in the hope that it will spark helpful
discussions. We go through the motivation in simple terms, which stems from the
link between the entropy of a uniform distribution and the logarithm of the
measure associated to its support. If one extends this notion to quantum
mechanics, the associated measure is non-additive. We will explore some
properties of this "quantum measure", its reasonableness in terms of the
physics, but its peculiarity on the math side. We will explore the need for a
set of properties that can properly characterize the measure and a
generalization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative to define a properly extended
probability calculus that reduces to the standard additive one on sets of
physically distinguishable cases (i.e. orthogonal measurement outcomes).

Result: 证明了GKSL定理，给出了完全正定保迹半群的生成元形式，并推广到无限维和时间依赖情况。

Conclusion: GKSL定理为量子开放系统的动力学提供了完整的数学框架，适用于有限维和无限维系统，且可扩展至时间依赖生成元。

Abstract: The Lindblad equation embodies a fundamental paradigm of the quantum theory
of open systems, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL)
generation theorem says precisely which superoperators can appear on its
right-hand side. These are the generators of completely positive
trace-preserving (or nonincreasing) semigroups. A complete exposition of this
theorem is given. The finite-dimensional case is handled using a form of
Jamio\l{}kowski transform. The treatment requires no previous knowledge of
complete positivity and obtains the Choi-Kraus presentation along the way. The
(separable) infinite-dimensional case is handled by means of a sequence of
finite-dimensional approximations, using the finite-dimensional case as a
crucial tool. An extension to time-dependent generator is also given.

Method: 构建了一个d级开放量子系统的动力学框架，通过扩展系统研究噪声对QMPE的作用，并以三能级系统为例进行说明。

Result: 噪声可以引入新模式，显著影响系统的弛豫动力学，导致QMPE的异常减慢或消除，并发现噪声可能减缓退相干速率。

Conclusion: 噪声对QMPE具有复杂影响，可能诱导或消除该效应，甚至产生反直觉的退相干减缓现象。

Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an intriguing anomalous relaxation
phenomenon, has recently attracted significant attention. However, how various
types of noise, which are ubiquitous in real systems, may affect the QMPE
remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by constructing a general dynamical
framework for d level open quantum systems under random telegraph noise. By
investigating the dynamics of an extended system and then projecting back, we
find that noise can induce additional modes and strongly influence the
relaxation dynamics of the original system. Specially, in the limit of long
correlation time of noise, these modes cause anomalous slowdown for certain
initial states, thereby inducing or eliminating QMPE, illustrated by a
three-level example system. Interestingly, this mechanism leads to a counter
intuitive effect:the decoherence rate may be slowed down by noise.

Result: 揭示了自由状态在不同QRTs中资源性的复杂性和多样性。

Conclusion: 跨QRTs分析为理解量子资源的通用性提供了新视角。

Abstract: In the context of quantum resource theories (QRTs), free states are defined
as those which can be obtained at no cost under a certain restricted set of
conditions. However, when taking a free state from one QRT and evaluating it
through the optics of another QRT, it might well turn out that the state is now
extremely resourceful. Such realization has recently prompted numerous works
characterizing states across several QRTs. In this work we contribute to this
body of knowledge by analyzing the resourcefulness in free states for--and
across witnesses of--the QRTs of multipartite entanglement, fermionic
non-Gaussianity, imaginarity, realness, spin coherence, Clifford
non-stabilizerness, $S_n$-equivariance and non-uniform entanglement. We provide
rigorous theoretical results as well as present numerical studies that showcase
the rich and complex behavior that arises in this type of cross-examination.

Abstract: We numerically investigate the generation and dynamics of tripartite
entanglement among qubits (quantum emitters or atoms) in multimode cavity
quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Our cQED architecture features three initially
unentangled excited two-level quantum emitters confined within a
triangle-shaped multimode optical cavity, which later become entangled due to a
Jaynes-Cummings-like interaction. Using the tripartite negativity measure of
entanglement and fidelity with respect to the genuine tripartite entangled
state (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (or GHZ) state, to be precise), we analyze
the impact of the number of cavity modes, qubit locations, and losses
(spontaneous emission from qubits and photon leakage from the cavity mirrors)
on the generated entanglement. Our key results include the presence of two
kinds of retardation effects: one resulting from the time it takes for photons
to propagate from one qubit to another, and the other to complete one round
trip in the cavity. We observed these retardation effects only in multimode
cavities, with the exciting possibility of controlling the collapse and revival
patterns of tripartite entanglement by altering the qubit locations in the
cavity. Furthermore, the impact of losses on the generated entanglement and the
dependence of maximum entanglement on the total number of modes yield results
that surpass those reported for single and two excitations. With recent
advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics, these findings hold promise for
the development of entanglement-based quantum networking protocols and quantum
memories.

Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the
fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. Here, we study a
two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via
discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two
two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and
is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the
catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is
driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst
leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of
performance (COP) to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to
operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a
catalyst. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to
broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass
conventional thermodynamic performance limits.

Abstract: Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy
gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other
hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated,
we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In
this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman
amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes
light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than
3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the
Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the
quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme,
when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid
interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.

Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are a promising platform for scalable quantum computing
due to their compatibility with industrial semiconductor fabrication and the
recent scaling to multi-qubit devices. Control fidelities above the 99%
fault-tolerant threshold are routinely achieved, but extending high-fidelity
control to simultaneous multi-qubit operation remains a major challenge. We
demonstrate high-fidelity, fully parallel control of five silicon spin qubits
using a single shared microwave line. Using tailored control pulses, all qubits
achieve primitive $\pi/2$ gate fidelities well above 99.99%, with some
approaching 99.999%, exceeding previously reported fidelities in silicon spin
qubits. These fidelities are mostly preserved during simultaneous operation of
up to three qubits, and remain at the practical fault-tolerant threshold of
99.9% even during fully parallel five-qubit operation. This performance is
enabled by a calibration scheme that compensates drive-induced phase shifts
using only pairwise calibrations, scaling quadratically with qubit number and
avoiding exponential overhead. By reducing the number of impedance-controlled
microwave lines, our approach addresses a key architectural bottleneck and
offers a scalable control strategy for high-fidelity operation in large spin
qubit arrays.

Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems
makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic
coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as
the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be
accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an
optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables
the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the
currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian
distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the
fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to
realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a
series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat
states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for
the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks
and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the
photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.

Abstract: Program obfuscation aims to hide the inner workings of a program while
preserving its functionality. In the quantum setting, recent works have
obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For
instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a
quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum
programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum
programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model.
  In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first
quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum
programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model.
At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional
quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific
functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security,
and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective
linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive
Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.

Abstract: Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) is an emerging field aimed at automating
the design of quantum circuits for optimal performance. This paper introduces a
novel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with
quantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle
increasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four
state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN,
TD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for
optimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively
increases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging
parameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning
efficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are
augmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show
that quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a
2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with
~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400). In the
more complex 3-qubit setting, PERQDDQN and PERQTD3 reach success probabilities
of ~0.47, with optimal success counts of ~3,800 and ~3,600, respectively,
outperforming their classical counterparts. Additionally, we apply our QAS-QTN
approach to a classification problem, where the optimized quantum circuit
achieves an accuracy of 90.33\%, outperforming quantum models consisting of
random ansatz. This hybrid classical-quantum approach leads to faster
convergence and more efficient quantum circuit designs, demonstrating its
potential for advancing automated quantum architecture search.

Abstract: Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum
systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication
networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum
lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units.
Each unit integrates a single-mode cavity that interacts with a two-level
system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLLs. This
configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and
photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin
interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we
simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their
transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the
importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters
for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of
excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insight into
designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in
low-dimensional quantum systems.

Motivation: 多量子比特操作（如Toffoli门）在交换量子比特平台上的实现存在效率低和误差高的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 开发了JK算法，通过梯度优化设计紧凑且高保真的交换门序列。

Result: Toffoli门的交换幺正操作从216减少到92，时间步骤从162压缩到50，且误差降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: JK算法为EO架构中的多量子比特门合成提供了一种通用且可扩展的策略，有望推动半导体平台上的多量子比特算法实现。

Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a
compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by
enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While
high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis
of efficient multi-qubit operations -- such as the Toffoli gate -- remains a
key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations
lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical
deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm,
Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate
sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required
exchange unitaries from 216 (in standard decomposition) to 92, and compress the
time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity.
Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence
is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. These
results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy
for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating
realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.

Abstract: It is widely recognized that quantum computing has profound impacts on
multiple fields, including but not limited to cryptography, machine learning,
materials science, etc. To run quantum algorithms, it is essential to develop
scalable quantum hardware with low noise levels and to design efficient
fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) schemes. Currently, various FTQC
schemes have been developed for different hardware platforms. However, a
comprehensive framework for the analysis and evaluation of these schemes is
still lacking. In this work, we propose Quantum Logical Operations Per Second
(QLOPS) as a metric for assessing the performance of FTQC schemes on quantum
hardware platforms. This benchmarking framework will integrate essential
relevant factors, e.g., the code rates of quantum error-correcting codes, the
accuracy, throughput, and latency of the decoder, and reflect the practical
requirements of quantum algorithm execution. This framework will enable the
identification of bottlenecks in quantum hardware, providing potential
directions for their development. Moreover, our results will help establish a
comparative framework for evaluating FTQC designs. As this benchmarking
approach considers practical applications, it may assist in estimating the
hardware resources needed to implement quantum algorithms and offers
preliminary insights into potential timelines.

Conclusion: 资源中心任务导向的方案为量子网络管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum networks exhibit fundamental differences from their classical
counterparts. These differences necessitate novel principles when organizing,
managing, and operating them. Here we propose an unconventional approach to
organize and manage the operations of quantum network devices. Instead of a
hierarchical scheme using layers, like in classical networks and present
quantum network stack models, we propose a resource-centric task-based scheme.
In this scheme, quantum applications pose objectives, initiated by a node, to a
quantum network, such as sharing an entangled state or sending a qubit along a
path. The quantum network node initiating the objective consequently derives a
distributed workflow, referred to as saga, comprising numerous tasks operating
on resources, which completes the objective. We identify three different kinds
of resources with their own and independent topology, namely classical
messaging, quantum channels and entanglement. Sagas can either be centrally
orchestrated or performed in choreography by the network nodes. The tasks of a
saga originate from and operate on resources of the network, such as quantum
channels or entanglement, and they not only comprise operations and
measurements, but potentially also include other tasks or even entire
protocols, such as sending a qubit, distributing entanglement or performing
entanglement purification steps.

Abstract: High-quality quantum states lie at the heart of advanced quantum information
processing. The degree of photon indistinguishability is critical for
applications from photonic quantum computation to precision metrology. The
two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference effect provides a rigorous
quantification method, with its visibility serving as the ultimate benchmark
for source quality. Generally, the coherent pumping is widely regarded as
indispensable for the preparation of quantum sources. As a result, incoherent
light sources have seen limited applications in the current quantum
technologies. In this work, we generate an indistinguishable two-photon state
by incoherent light generated by frequency doubling of Amplified Spontaneous
Emission light. The theoretical analysis indicates that phase randomization of
the pumping does not affect the coincidence visibility in two-photon intensity
interference. Moreover, temporal incoherence further enhances the symmetry of
the generated spectrum in second-harmonic generation. In the experiment, the
incoherently pumped photon sources exhibit a heralding efficiency of
approximately 60\% and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 15000. The
observed HOM interference fringes show the visibility of 99.1\% without any
spectrum filtering, confirming the near-ideal indistinguishability of the
photons. Our study reveals the role of temporal coherence in second-order
nonlinear interactions, it provide a potential approach to use an easily
accessible incoherent light for engineering high-quality quantum sources.

Abstract: A simple parametrized family of quantum systems consisting of two entangled
subsystems, dubbed left and right ones, both of them featuring N qubits is
considered in the thermofield double formalism. We assume that the system
evolves in a purely geometric manner based on the parallel transport condition
due to Uhlmann. We explore the different interpretations of this evolution
relative to observers either coupled to the left or to the right subsystems.
The Uhlmann condition breaks the symmetry between left and right by regarding
one of the two possible sets of local unitary operations as gauge degrees of
freedom. Then gauging the right side we show that the geometric evolution on
the left manifests itself via certain local operations reminiscent of
non-unitary filtering measurements. On the other hand on the right the basic
evolutionary steps are organized into a sequence of unitary operations of a
holonomic quantum computation. We calculate the Uhlmann connection governing
the transport for our model which turns out to be related to higher dimensional
instantons. Then we evaluate the anholonomy of the connection for geodesic
triangles with geodesic segments defined with respect to the Bures metric. By
analysing the explicit form of the local filtering measurements showing up on
the left side we realize that they are also optimal measurements for
distinguishing two given mixed states in the statistical sense. We also point
out that by conducting an interference experiment on the right side one can
observe the physical effects of the anholonomic quantum computation. We
demonstrate this by calculating explicit examples for phase shifts and
visibility patterns arising in such interference experiments. Finally a
sequence of geodesic triangles producing the iSWAP gate via anholonomy needed
for computational universality is presented.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of
quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum
entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical
simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the
other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states
as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and
the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable
dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This
formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function
dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in
terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of
qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over
phase-space.

Abstract: Constraint handling remains a key bottleneck in quantum combinatorial
optimization. While slack-variable-based encodings are straightforward, they
significantly increase qubit counts and circuit depth, challenging the
scalability of quantum solvers. In this work, we investigate a suite of
Lagrangian-based optimization techniques including dual ascent, bundle methods,
cutting plane approaches, and augmented Lagrangian formulations for solving
constrained combinatorial problems on quantum simulators and hardware. Our
framework is applied to three representative NP-hard problems: the Travelling
Salesman Problem (TSP), the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), and the
Maximum Independent Set (MIS).
  We demonstrate that MDKP and TSP, with their inequality-based or
degree-constrained structures, allow for slack-free reformulations, leading to
significant qubit savings without compromising performance. In contrast, MIS
does not inherently benefit from slack elimination but still gains in
feasibility and objective quality from principled Lagrangian updates. We
benchmark these methods across classically hard instances, analyzing trade-offs
in qubit usage, feasibility, and optimality gaps. Our results highlight the
flexibility of Lagrangian formulations as a scalable alternative to naive QUBO
penalization, even when qubit savings are not always achievable. This work

pipelines, with applications in logistics, network design, and resource
allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为量子架构搜索提供系统化的RL算法评估框架，促进量子电路设计的进步。

Method: 提出BenchRL-QAS框架，评估9种RL代理在多种量子任务中的表现，并提出加权排名指标。

Result: RL量子分类器优于基线变分分类器，但无单一RL算法在所有任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: 量子电路设计需根据任务背景选择算法，BenchRL-QAS框架公开以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically
evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture
search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system
sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including
both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems
such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state
diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both
noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric
that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational
efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first
reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational
classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally
optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly
context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This
empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in
RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored
algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit
synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking
effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made
publicly available to support reproducibility and future research

Conclusion: 该系统适用于存储非经典态，有望加速纠缠分布速率。

Abstract: The exploitation of multimodality in different degrees of freedom is one of
the most promising ways to increase the rate of heralded entanglement between
distant quantum nodes. In this paper, we realize a spatially-multiplexed
solid-state quantum memory array with ten individually controllable spin-wave
memory cells featuring on-demand read-out and temporal multiplexing. By
combining spatial and temporal multiplexing, we store weak coherent pulses at
the single-photon level in up to 250 spatio-temporal modes, with an average
signal-to-noise ratio of 10(2). We perform a thorough characterization of the
whole system, including its multiplexing and demultiplexing stage. We verify
that the memory array exhibits low cross-talk even at the single-photon level.
The measured performance indicates readiness for storing non-classical states
and promises a speed-up in entanglement distribution rates.

Abstract: Nick Huggett, James Ladyman, and Karim Thebault (HLT) have presented a

central objective is to challenge our position on the matter-namely, that the
BOA incorporates a classical assumption incompatible with the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle. In contrast, HLT contend that the BOA involves no such
classical assumption and, as a result, supports the view that chemistry can be
reduced to physics. The purpose of this paper is to offer a critical analysis
of the HLT article and to clarify why we consider their arguments unpersuasive.

Conclusion: 高压缩参数下广义压缩态的平均光子数是非递减函数，排除了固有振荡的可能性，需谨慎处理高阶压缩态。

Abstract: A recent article [S. Ashhab and M. Ayyash, New J. Phys. 27, 054104 (2025)]
has reported unexpected oscillatory dynamics in generalized squeezed states of
order higher than two as their squeezing parameter increases. This behaviour,
observed through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and
creation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including
their average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect
a genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed
oscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical
analysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation
of the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported
by a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number,
suggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after
a finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical
proof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a
non-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic
oscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the
reported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with
high-order squeezing states.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) underpins practical fault-tolerant quantum
computing (FTQC) by addressing the fragility of quantum states and mitigating
decoherence-induced errors. As quantum devices scale, integrating robust QEC
protocols is imperative to suppress logical error rates below threshold and
ensure reliable operation, though current frameworks suffer from substantial
qubit overheads and hardware inefficiencies. Design automation in the QEC flow
is thus critical, enabling automated synthesis, transpilation, layout, and
verification of error-corrected circuits to reduce qubit footprints and push
fault-tolerance margins. This chapter presents a comprehensive treatment of
design automation in QEC, structured into four main sections. The first section
delves into the theoretical aspects of QEC, covering logical versus physical
qubit representations, stabilizer code construction, and error syndrome
extraction mechanisms. In the second section, we outline the QEC design flow,
detailing the areas highlighting the need for design automation. The third
section surveys recent advancements in design automation techniques, including
algorithmic $T$-gate optimization, modified surface code architecture to
incorporate lesser qubit overhead, and machine-learning-based decoder
automation. The final section examines near-term FTQC architectures,
integrating automated QEC pipelines into scalable hardware platforms and
discussing end-to-end verification methodologies. Each section is complemented
by case studies of recent research works, illustrating practical
implementations and performance trade-offs. Collectively, this chapter aims to
equip readers with a holistic understanding of design automation in QEC system
design in the fault-tolerant landscape of quantum computing.

Motivation: 高雷诺数湍流模拟在传统CFD工具中具有挑战性，量子计算有望提供速度优势，但非线性碰撞步骤的实现仍存在困难。

Method: 通过训练一个四量子比特电路，模拟BGK碰撞算子的物理特性，如质量和动量守恒、D8等变性和尺度等变性。

Result: 在IBM Heron处理器上验证，SQC仅需2,430个原生门，无需辅助量子比特或后选择，且深度与网格分辨率无关。

Conclusion: SQC在泰勒-格林涡旋衰减和盖驱动腔流中验证了其准确性，展示了量子并行性的潜力。

Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers
remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing
interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum
computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver
potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is
a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM.
Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step,
implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth
circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and
repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address
this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum
circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision
operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the
physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum
conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate
set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit
connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses
neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its
depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation
that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on
two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity,
demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow
recirculation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于对称量子de Finetti定理的方法，用于高效计算固定尺寸双人自由游戏在固定维度纠缠辅助下的最优值ε-加法近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分析方法在计算此类游戏的最优值时，仅能提供指数级复杂度的保证，而无法实现多项式时间的高效近似。

Method: 利用Bose对称量子de Finetti定理，设计了一种半定规划（SDP）外层次结构，并通过表示论对称性简化技术，将计算复杂度降至多项式级别。

Result: 实现了多项式时间内的ε-加法近似，并提出了基于测量的舍入方案，生成可验证的纠缠策略序列。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于特定游戏，还可能推广至量子信息理论中更广泛的约束可分性问题。

Abstract: We show that $\varepsilon$-additive approximations of the optimal value of
fixed-size two-player free games with fixed-dimensional entanglement assistance
can be computed in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$. This stands in contrast
to previous analytic approaches, which focused on scaling with the number of
questions and answers, but yielded only strict $\mathrm{exp}(1/\varepsilon)$
guarantees. Our main result is based on novel Bose-symmetric quantum de Finetti
theorems tailored for constrained quantum separability problems. These results
give rise to semidefinite programming (SDP) outer hierarchies for approximating
the entangled value of such games. By employing representation-theoretic
symmetry reduction techniques, we demonstrate that these SDPs can be formulated
and solved with computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$,
thereby enabling efficient $\varepsilon$-additive approximations. In addition,
we introduce a measurement-based rounding scheme that translates the resulting
outer bounds into certifiably good inner sequences of entangled strategies.
These strategies can, for instance, serve as warm starts for see-saw
optimization methods. We believe that our techniques are of independent
interest for broader classes of constrained separability problems in quantum
information theory.

Abstract: In this thesis, I studied a mathematical development to define and quantify
the uncertainty inherent in classical channels. This thesis starts with the
introduction and background on how to formally think about uncertainty in the
domain of classical states. The concept of probability vector majorization and
its variants, relative majorization and conditional majorization, are reviewed.
This thesis introduces three conceptually distinct approaches to formalize the
notion of uncertainty inherent in classical channels. These three approaches
define the same preordering on the domain of classical channels, leading to
characterizations from many perspectives. With the solid foundation of
uncertainty comparison, classical channel entropy is then defined to be an
additive monotone with respect to the majorization relation. The well-known
entropies in the domain of classical states are uniquely extended to the domain
of channels via the optimal extensions, providing not only a solid foundation
but also the quantifiers of uncertainty inherent in classical channels.

Abstract: Quantum devices require precisely calibrated analog signals, a process that
is complex and time-consuming. Many calibration strategies exist, and all
require careful analysis and tuning to optimize system availability. To enable
rigorous statistical evaluation of quantum calibration procedures, we leverage
statistical model checking (SMC), a technique used in fields that require
statistical guarantees. SMC allows for probabilistic evaluation of properties
of interest, such as a certain parameter's time to failure. We extend the SMC
for Processor Analysis (SPA) framework, which uses SMC for evaluation of
classical systems, to create SPA for Quantum calibration (SPAQ) enabling
simplified tuning and analysis of quantum system calibration. We focus on a
directed acyclic graph-based calibration optimization scheme and demonstrate
how to craft properties of interest for its analysis. We show how to use SPAQ
to find lower bounds of time to failure information, hidden node dependencies,
and parameter threshold values and use that information to improve simulated
quantum system availability through calibration scheme adjustments.

Abstract: We revisit the extendability-based semi-definite programming hierarchy
introduced by Berta et al. [Mathematical Programming, 1 - 49 (2021)], which
provides converging outer bounds on the optimal fidelity of approximate quantum
error correction (AQEC). As our first contribution, we introduce a
measurement-based rounding scheme that extracts inner sequences of certifiably
good encoder-decoder pairs from this outer hierarchy. To address the
computational complexity of evaluating fixed levels of the hierarchy, we
investigate the use of symmetry-based dimension reduction. In particular, we
combine noise symmetries - such as those present in multiple copies of the
qubit depolarizing channel - with the permutational symmetry arising from the
extendability of the optimization variable. This framework is illustrated
through basic, but already challenging numerical examples that showcase its
practical effectiveness. Our results contribute to narrowing the gap between
theoretical developments in quantum information theory and their practical
applications in the analysis of small-scale quantum error-correcting codes.

Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) use the inherent unpredictability of
quantum mechanics to generate true randomness, as opposed to classical random
number generators. However, ensuring the authenticity of this randomness still
requires robust verification. Self-testing QRNGs address this need by enabling
the validation of the randomness produced based on the observed data from the
experiment while requiring few assumptions. In this work, we present a
practical, self-testing QRNG designed to operate with an untrusted measurement
device and a partially characterized source, allowing the user to check the
adequate functioning of the setup in real time. Our experiment yields a rate of
certified random bits of 450kbps

Abstract: Probabilistic entangling measurements are key operations in linear-optical
quantum technologies, enabling the generation and manipulation of
high-dimensional quantum states. While prior research has focused predominantly
on specific entangled states, notably graph states and
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, broader classes of states with
variable entanglement remain underexplored. In this work, we present a
linear-optical approach for generating and fusing GHZ-like states, which
generalize standard GHZ states to include variable entanglement degrees. We
introduce two schemes based on modified fusion gates that allow flexible
control over generation efficiency and the entanglement of the output states.
These results offer a promising pathway toward resource-efficient
entangled-state generation for scalable quantum computing and communication.

Conclusion: ExcLQA是一种有效的方法，可用于识别激发态，并在实际问题中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce excited local quantum annealing (ExcLQA), a classical,
physics-inspired algorithm that extends local quantum annealing (LQA) to
identify excited states of classical Ising Hamiltonians. LQA simulates quantum
annealing while constraining the quantum state to remain in a product state and
uses a gradient-based approach to find approximate solutions to large-scale
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. ExcLQA extends this
framework by adding a penalty term in the cost function to target excited
states, with a single hyperparameter that can be tuned via binary search to set
the desired penalization level. We benchmark ExcLQA on the shortest vector
problem (SVP), a fundamental lattice problem underlying the security of many
postquantum cryptographic schemes. Solving an SVP instance can be mapped to
identifying the first excited state of a Hamiltonian, with approximate
solutions located among nearby excited states. Our results show that ExcLQA
manages to solve SVP instances up to rank 46, and outperforms the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in solved ratio, number of shots, and
approximation factor in the tested instances.

Result: 证明了编译器对所有多部分非局部游戏具有量子健全性，并构建了新的C*-代数工具。

Conclusion: 研究不仅推广了先前结果，还提出了新的C*-代数链规则，具有独立的理论意义。

Abstract: Non-local games are a powerful tool to distinguish between correlations
possible in classical and quantum worlds. Kalai et al. (STOC'23) proposed a
compiler that converts multipartite non-local games into interactive protocols
with a single prover, relying on cryptographic tools to remove the assumption
of physical separation of the players. While quantum completeness and classical
soundness of the construction have been established for all multipartite games,
quantum soundness is known only in the special case of bipartite games.
  In this paper, we prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler indeed achieves
quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled non-local games, by showing
that any correlations that can be generated in the asymptotic case correspond
to quantum commuting strategies.
  Our proof uses techniques from the theory of operator algebras, and relies on
a characterisation of sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as
quantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case, thereby
generalising several previous results. On the way, we construct universal
C*-algebras of sequential PVMs and prove a new chain rule for Radon-Nikodym
derivatives of completely positive maps on C*-algebras which may be of
independent interest.

Abstract: Two-dimensional planar ion crystals in a Penning trap are a platform for
quantum information science experiments. However, the low-frequency planar
modes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can
limit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing.
Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the
cooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical
simulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically
changing the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments.
Furthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower
temperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling
process. This result allows cooling of the planar modes to sub-millikelvin
temperatures, resulting in improved spectral resolution of the drumhead modes
at experimentally relevant rotation frequencies, which is crucial for quantum
information processing applications.

Motivation: 量子相位估计是量子模拟的核心算法，但传统方法需要大量采样。本文旨在通过压缩感知和信号分类技术，减少采样需求并提高效率。

Method: 结合离格压缩感知协议和先进的信号分类方法，利用Hadamard测试估计多个特征值，仅需少量采样。

Result: 算法在强相关和弱相关区域均达到海森堡极限，且能以短演化时间高精度估计多个特征值。

Conclusion: 该算法具有潜在量子优势，且通过改进的离格协议进一步提升了恢复速度和精度。

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is the flagship algorithm for quantum simulation on
fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate that an \emph{off-grid}
compressed sensing protocol, combined with a state-of-the-art signal
classification method, enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple
eigenvalues of a unitary matrix using the Hadamard test while sampling only a
few percent of the full autocorrelation function. Our numerical evidence
indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves the Heisenberg limit in both
strongly and weakly correlated regimes and requires very short evolution times
to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate of multiple eigenvalues at once.
  Additionally -- and of independent interest -- we develop a modified off-grid
protocol that leverages prior knowledge of the underlying signal for faster and
more accurate recovery. Finally, we argue that this algorithm may offer a
potential quantum advantage by analyzing its resilience with respect to the
quality of the initial input state.

Conclusion: 人工磁场可显著调控玻色子系统的相行为，实验结果有望验证理论预测。

Abstract: We consider effects of artificial magnetic fields on the ground state of the
two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. Using an asymmetric Bose-Hubbard model, we
demonstrate that the frustrating hopping energy localizes bosons and enlarges
insulators and supersolid borders. We show these increments in the presence of
artificial gauge fields up to a symmetric point of the field. Moreover, our
calculations exhibit the real space modulations of the superfluid and
supersolid phases. The bosonic current exhibits vortices in these phases, which
their configurations depend on the commensuration between the magnetic field
and the lattice. Although the magnetic field breaks the translational symmetry
of the square lattice explicitly, this symmetry is restored in the Mott
insulator phase. The filling factor exhibits a checkerboard pattern in the
density-wave and supersolid phases, regardless of the magnetic field strength.
We explore thermal fluctuations and demonstrate the robustness of insulators
and SS phases up to temperatures comparable to the interaction energy, which
support the feasibility of observing such phases in experiments.

Abstract: We demonstrate a reinforcement learning (RL) based control framework for
optimizing evaporative cooling in the preparation of strongly interacting
degenerate Fermi gases of Li6. Using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the
system autonomously explores a high-dimensional parameter space to learn
optimal cooling trajectories. Compared to conventional exponential ramps, our
method achieves up to 130% improvement in atomic density within a 0.5 second,
revealing non-trivial control strategies that balance fast evaporation and
thermalization. While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation
stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses
cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result
highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control
and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.

Conclusion: 簇化现象在扭曲双层光学晶格中导致复杂的基态物理行为，为研究新型量子相提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent experiments have realized ultra-cold gases in twisted-bilayer optical
lattices. We show that interacting bosons in these lattices present a highly
non-trivial ground-state physics resulting from the interplay between inter-
and intra-layer hopping and interactions. This physics is crucially determined
by site clusterization, which we properly take into account by developing a
specifically-tailored cluster Gutzwiller approach. Clusterization results in a
large variety of different Mott-like phases characterized by typically
different occupations of the clusters, and in the appearance of pockets of
sites in between which particles can freely move, but which remain disconnected
from each other. This peculiar phase, which resembles the well-known Bose glass
phase, may occur even for commensurate twist angles and is further enhanced
when the twisting is incommensurate. Moreover, in the incommensurate case, the
formation of mobility islands may occur even without inter-layer hopping solely
due to inter-layer interactions.

Conclusion: 噪声调制下纠缠动力学可通过随机准粒子图像描述，纠缠增长呈现扩散特性。

Abstract: We investigate out-of-equilibrium entanglement dynamics in a generalization
of the so-called $QSSEP$ model, which is a free-fermion chain with stochastic
in space and time hopping amplitudes. In our setup, the noisy amplitudes are
spatially-modulated satisfying a $\nu$-site translation invariance but
retaining their randomness in time. For each noise realization, the dynamics
preserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged
entanglement-related quantities. The statistics of the steady-state correlators
satisfy nontrivial relationships that are of topological nature. They reflect
the Haar invariance under multiplication with structured momentum-dependent
random $SU(\nu)$ matrices. We discuss in detail the case with $\nu=1$ and
$\nu=2$. For $\nu=1$, i.e., spatially homogeneous noise we show that the
entanglement dynamics is describable by a stochastic generalization of the
quasiparticle picture. Precisely, entanglement is propagated by pairs of
quasiparticles. The entanglement content of the pairs is the same as for the
deterministic chain. However, the trajectories of the quasiparticles are random
walks, giving rise to diffusive entanglement growth.

Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical
phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation
parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for
thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility,
and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical
temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale
invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to
fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are
constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical
expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental
data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and
capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge
between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with
implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.

Abstract: We present an alternative geometric representation for the eleven Archimedean
lattices, in which each site and bond is uniquely labeled by an ordered pair of
integers and characterized via a modular function. This structured labeling
enables efficient and systematic implementation of computational models on
these lattices, without relying on ad hoc indexing, and provides a versatile
framework for future studies on regular tilings.
  As an application, we obtain, for each Archimedean lattice, the phase
diagrams generated by monomer deposition for the site-bond percolation models
known in the literature as S \cup B and S \cap B. We show that these diagrams
are ordered in phase space according to the partial and total inclusion
relations among the lattices, as demonstrated by Parviainen et al. (2003).
  Furthermore, for the lattice pairs (3.6.3.6)/(3.4.6.4) and
(3^3.4^2)/(3^2.4.3.4), we observe an inversion between the pure site and bond
percolation thresholds. We show that this phenomenon is linked to the crossing
of their respective phase diagrams, highlighting the sensitivity of critical
behavior to lattice topology.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of an athermal inertial run-and-tumble particle moving
in a shear-thickening medium in $d=1$. The viscosity of the medium is
represented by a nonlinear function $f(v)\sim\tan(v)$, while a symmetric
dichotomous noise of strength $\Sigma$ and flipping rate $\lambda$ models the
activity of the particle. Starting from the Fokker-Planck~(FP) equation for the
time-dependent probability distribution $W_{\pm\Sigma}(v, t)$ of the particle's
velocity $v$ at time $t$ and the active force is $\pm\Sigma$, we analytically
derive the steady-state velocity distribution function $W_s(v)$ and a
quadrature expression for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$.
For a fixed $\Sigma$, $W_s(v)$ undergoes multiple transitions with varying
$\lambda$, and we have identified the corresponding transition points. We then
numerically compute $W_s(v)$, the mean-squared velocity $\langle
v^2\rangle(t)$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$, all of which show
excellent agreement with the analytical results in the steady-state. Finally,
we test the robustness of the transitions in $W_s(v)$ by considering an
alternative $f(v)$ function that also capture the shear-thickening behavior of
the medium.

Conclusion: 矩阵加权网络（MWNs）为多维动态过程的同步分析提供了有效框架，相干性是实现全局同步的关键。

Abstract: Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding
collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such
systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many
real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To
address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced
as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that
encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work,
we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization in MWNs by
studying coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators-an archetypal model of nonlinear
dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. We derive a generalized Master Stability
Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient
conditions for synchronization to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept
of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent
transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to achieve global
synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing
multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.

Abstract: We study the zero-temperature quasi-statically driven dynamics of the random
field Blume-Emery-Griffiths model (RFBEGM) as a prototype for disordered
systems with competing interactions. While the random field Ising model is
known to obey the no-passing rule we show that this property is generically
violated in the RFBEGM. By exploring the full parameter space, we identify the
precise conditions under which no-passing is broken, particularly in the regime
where a repulsive biquadratic coupling introduces frustration. Here, we find
that this violation leaves a clear fingerprint in the form of a discontinuity
in the distribution of the field increments between successive avalanches. We
provide analytical arguments that locate the onset of this discontinuity, in
excellent agreement with numerical simulations.

Abstract: The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same
interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective
excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such
intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition
between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we
introduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the
measurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact
(trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all
within a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the
collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator
(TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22
THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted
behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs
mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz
exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode
intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking
suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the
splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via
parametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two
photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason
competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies
reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective
excitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast
phenomena.

Abstract: In the multichannel Kondo effect, overscreening of a magnetic impurity by
conduction electrons leads to a frustrated exotic ground state. It has been
proposed that multichannel topological Kondo (MCTK) model involving topological
Cooper pair boxes with $M$ Majorana modes [SO($M$) "spin"] and $N$ spinless
electron channels exhibits an exotic intermediate coupling fixed point. This
intermediate fixed point has been analyzed through large-$N$ perturbative
calculations, which gives a zero-temperature conductance decaying as $1/N^2$ in
the large-$N$ limit. However, the conductance at this intermediate fixed point
has not been calculated for generic $N$. Using representation theory, we verify
the existence of this intermediate-coupling fixed point and find the
strong-coupling effective Hamiltonian for the case $M=4$. Using conformal field
theory techniques for SO($M$), we generalize the notion of overscreening and
conclude that the MCTK model is an overscreened Kondo model. We find the
fixed-point finite-size energy spectrum and the leading irrelevant operator
(LIO). We express the fixed-point conductance in terms of the modular S-matrix
of SO($M$) for general $N$, confirming the previous large-$N$ result. We
describe the finite-temperature corrections to the conductance by the LIO and
find that they are qualitatively different for the cases $N=1$ and $N\geq2$ due
to the different fusion outcomes with the current operator. We also compare the
multichannel topological Kondo model to the topological symplectic Kondo model.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of quantum magnetism in two spatial dimensions are
often constrained by the area law of entanglement entropy, which heavily limits
the accessible system sizes in tensor network methods. In this work, we
investigate how the choice of mapping from a two-dimensional lattice to a
one-dimensional path affects the accuracy of the two-dimensional Density Matrix
Renormalization Group algorithm. We systematically evaluate all mappings
corresponding to a subset of the Hamiltonian paths of the $N \cross N$ grid
graphs up to $N=8$ and demonstrate that the fractal space-filling curves
generally lead to faster convergence in ground state searches compared to the
commonly used ``snake" path. To explain this performance gain, we analyze
various locality metrics and propose a scalable method for constructing
high-performing paths on larger lattices by tiling smaller optimal paths. Our
results show that such paths consistently improve simulation convergence, with
the advantage increasing with system size.

Abstract: Trillium lattices, where magnetic ions form a three-dimensional chiral
network of corner-sharing equilateral triangular motifs, offer a prominent
platform to explore exotic quantum states. In this work, we report ground-state
properties of the $S$ = 5/2 trillium lattice compound
K$_{2}$FeSn(PO$_{4}$)$_{3}$ through thermodynamic, electron spin resonance
(ESR), and muon spin relaxation (${\mu}$SR) experiments. Thermodynamic and ESR
measurements reveal the two-step evolution of magnetic correlations across
$T^{*}$ = 11 K, which results from an interplay between dominant
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions and subleading interactions. Below
$T^{*}$, \textit{dc} and \textit{ac} magnetic susceptibilities indicate weak
\textcolor{black}{magnetic ordering} at $T_{\rm N} \approx 2$ K under low
fields, which is suppressed for $\mu_{0}H \geq 2$ T, consistent with a
power-law dependence of magnetic specific heat at low temperatures. $\mu$SR
experiments confirm the dominance of persistent spin dynamics and the absence
of conventional spin freezing, supporting the subtle nature of weak magnetic
ordering coexisting with spin-liquid-like fluctuations. These findings
underscore the potential for realizing a classical spin-liquid ground state
with exotic excitations in high-spin trillium lattice systems.

Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) domain wall of 2D $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological
orders is studied theoretically. The Ising domain wall model is shown to have
an emergent SU(2)$_{1}$ conformal symmetry because of a hidden nonsymmorphic
octahedral symmetry. While a weak magnetic field is an irrelevant perturbation
to the bulk topological orders, it induces a domain wall transition from the
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to a ferromagnetic order, which spontaneously breaks
the anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry and the time-reversal symmetry on the
domain wall. Moreover, the gapless domain wall state also realizes a 1D
topological quantum critical point between a
$\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{T}$-symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase,
thus demonstrating the holographic construction of topological transitions.

Conclusion: 研究为自旋-声子杂化效应的实验观测提供了理论基础，并讨论了平衡与非平衡条件下的可能性。

Abstract: CuGeO$_3$ has long been studied as a prototypical example of the spin-Peierls
transition in a $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg chain. Despite intensive investigation of
this quasi-one-dimensional material, systematic measurements and calculations
of the phonon excitations in the dimerized phase have not to date been
possible, leaving certain aspects of the spin-Peierls phenomenon unresolved. We
perform state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
compute the electronic structure and phonon dynamics in the low-temperature
dimerized phase. We also perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy to
measure the full phonon spectrum over multiple Brillouin zones. We find
excellent agreement between our numerical and experimental results that extend
to all measurement temperatures. Notable features of our phonon spectra include
a number of steeply dispersive modes, nonmonotonic dispersion features, and
specific phonon anticrossings, which we relate to the mode eigenvectors. By
calculating the magnetic interactions within DFT and studying the effects of
different phonon modes on the superexchange paths, we discuss the possibility
of observing spin-phonon hybridization effects in experiments performed both in
and out of equilibrium.

Conclusion: 高温下CDW波动的研究为理解量子相变中电子与晶格自由度的复杂相互作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: 1T-TiSe$_2$ exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition below 200 K,
which is believed to be driven by a hybrid exciton-phonon mechanism, making it
a versatile platform for investigating the interplay between electronic and
lattice degrees of freedom. Although the corresponding band structure
modifications below the CDW transition temperature are well established, only a
few reports discuss the occurrence of the CDW fluctuating phase and its
spectral features well above the transition temperature. Here, we report the
direct observation of spectral features associated with CDW fluctuations at 295
K, using time-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy. We investigated
the transient melting and recovery of CDW fluctuations upon nonresonant
ultrafast photoexcitation. Surprisingly, our results reveal that the coherent
amplitude mode modulating the ultrafast CDW recovery persists at these elevated
temperatures. The time-, energy- and momentum-resolved photoemission data
supported by density functional perturbation theory further confirm that CDW
fluctuations at these elevated temperatures are dominated by electron-phonon
interaction. The analysis of these very localized microscopic fluctuations
consequently provides new insights into the complex interplay between the
electronic and lattice degrees of freedom at elevated temperatures and,
therefore, on the nature of this quantum phase transition.

Conclusion: 多通道Dyson方程在精确性和适用性上优于传统方法，为多体问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We have recently presented the multichannel Dyson equation as an alternative
to the standard single-channel Dyson equation. While the latter involves a
single many-body Green's function, the former uses a multichannel Green's
function in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled.
Quasiparticles and satellites are thus naturally treated on equal footing in
the multichannel Dyson equation. To assess the accuracy of our approach we
apply it here to the ground- and excited-state properties of the extended
Hubbard dimer, an exactly solvable model for $H_2$. In particular, we focus on
the potential energy surface as well as the corresponding spectral functions
and HOMO-LUMO gaps, which are well-known challenges for many-body
approximations such as second Born and $GW$. We show that the multichannel
Dyson equation gives overall very good results for all properties considered
and outperforms both $GW$ and second Born. In particular, the multichannel
Dyson equation yields the correct ground-state energy and HOMO-LUMO gap in the
dissociation limit contrary to $GW$.

Abstract: Controlling magnetic interactions at the level of individual spins is
relevant for a variety of quantum applications, such as qubits, memory and
sensor functionality. Finding ways to exert electrical control over spin
interactions, with minimal energy dissipation, is a key objective in this
endeavour. We show here that spin lattices and magnon gaps can be controlled
with a supercurrent. Remarkably, a spin-polarized supercurrent makes the
interaction between magnetic adatoms placed on the surface of a superconductor
depend not only on their relative distance, but also on their absolute position
in space. This property permits electric control over the interaction not only
between two individual spins, but in fact over an entire spin lattice, allowing
for non-collinear ground states and a practical arena to study the properties
of different spin Hamiltonians. Moreover, we show that a supercurrent controls
the magnon gap in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic insulators. These results
provide an accessible way to realize electrically controlled spin switching and
magnon gaps without dissipative currents.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a model with electrons and holes whose Fermi
surfaces are perfectly nested. The fermions are assumed to be interacting, both
with each other and with the lattice. To suppress inhomogeneous states, a
sufficiently strong long-range Coulomb repulsion is included into the model.
Using the mean field approximation, one can demonstrate that in the absence of
doping, the ground state of such a model is insulating and possesses a
density-wave order, either SDW, or CDW. Upon doping, a finite ferromagnetic
polarization emerges. It is argued that the mechanism driving the
ferromagnetism is not of the Stoner type. A phase diagram of the model is
constructed, and various properties of the ordered phases are studied.

Abstract: Understanding the generation, transport and capture of charge carriers in
semiconductors is of fundamental technological importance. However, the
ensemble measurement techniques ubiquitous in electronics offer limited insight
into the nanoscale environment that is crucial to the operation of modern
quantum-electronic devices. Here, we combine widefield optical microscopy with
precision spectroscopy to examine the capture of photogenerated holes by
negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond. Simultaneous
single-shot charge readout over hundreds of individual NVs allows us to resolve
the roles of ionized impurities, reveal the formation of space charges fields,
and monitor the thermalization of hot photo-carriers during diffusion. We
measure effective NV- hole capture radii in excess of 0.2 um, a value
approaching the Onsager limit and made possible here thanks to the
near-complete neutralization of coexisting charge traps. These results
establish a new platform for resolving charge dynamics beyond ensemble
averages, with direct relevance to nanoscale electronics and quantum devices.

Abstract: Spatial localization of quantum states is one of the focal points in
condensed matter physics and quantum simulations, as it signatures profound
physics such as nontrivial band topology and non-reciprocal non-Hermiticity.
Yet, in higher dimensions, characterizing state localization becomes elusive
due to the sophisticated interplay between different localization mechanisms
and spacial geometries. In this work, we unveil an exotic type of localization
phenomenon in higher-dimensional non-Hermitian systems, termed
anisotropic-scaling localization (ASL), where localization lengths follow
distinct size-dependent scaling rules in an anisotropic manner. Assisted with
both analytical solution and numerical simulation, we find that ASL can emerge
from two different mechanisms of effective bulk couplings or one-dimensional
junction between different 1D edges, depending on how non-reciprocity is
introduced to the system. The competition between ASL states and edge
non-Hermitian skin states are further identified by their complex and real
eigenenergies, respectively. Our results resolve the subtle co-existence of
loop-like spectrum and skin-like localization of boundary states in
contemporary literature, and provide a framework to classify the intricate
higher-order non- Hermitian localization regarding their localization profiles.

microwave-driven spin pumping induces a valley-selective spin excitation, a
direct consequence of the valley-asymmetric Landau levels in the TMDC
conduction band. This process generates a pure valley current which, as our
central finding, exhibits pronounced quantum oscillations as a function of
chemical potential. These oscillations provide a definitive experimental
signature of the quantized valley states and establish a new pathway to

Abstract: The propagation of transverse impact energy in a multilayer packing (in an
array) of parallel single-walled carbon nanotubes has been simulated. It has
been shown that such nanotube arrays are effective shock absorbers. The
depreciation effect is most pronounced for packings of nanotubes with a
diameter of 2.7-3.9 nm. Here, part of the impact energy is absorbed due to the
transfer of the packing to a higher energy stationary state, in which part of
the nanotubes is in a collapsed state. The impact impulse reaches the other
edge of the packing most weakened and distributed over time. For nanotubes with
a smaller diameter, the compression of the array occurs elastically without
energy accumulation, and for nanotubes with a larger diameter - with energy
release.

Abstract: In this work we present a systematic in-depth study of how we can alter the
magneto-transport properties of magnetic topological insulator thin films by
tuning the parameters of the molecular beam epitaxy. First, we show how a
varying substrate temperature changes the surface morphology and when chosen
properly leads to a high crystal quality. Next, the effect of the chromium
concentration on the film roughness and crystal quality is investigated.
Finally, both the substrate temperature and the chromium concentration are
investigated with respect to their effect on the magneto-transport properties
of the magnetic topological insulator thin films. It becomes apparent that the
substrate temperature and the chromium concentration can be used to tune the
Fermi level of the film which allows to make the material intrinsically charge
neutral. A very low chromium concentration furthermore allows to tune the
magnetic topological insulator into a regime where strong superconducting
correlations can be expected when combining the material with a superconductor.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate hole spins confined in a gate-defined quantum
dot (QD) embedded in GeSn/Ge/GeSn quantum well (QW) structure. Owing to the
tensile strain in the Ge layer, the system effectively realizes a light-hole
qubit. We systematically study how various morphological parameters influence
the energy spectrum, g-factors, and the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin
bath. The simulations are carried out using a realistic, fully atomic
sp$^3$d$^5$s$^*$ tight-binding model. We also perform complementary DFT
calculations of wave functions near the atomic cores and use them to
parameterize the hyperfine-interaction Hamiltonian. We evaluate the Overhauser
field fluctuations and demonstrate that the strength of the hyperfine coupling
for the lowest hole doublet crucially depends on the Sn content in the barrier.
We highlight the conduction-valence band mixing, which leads to considerable
$s$-type admixtures to the hole states, providing the dominant channel of
hyperfine coupling due to the Fermi contact interaction.

Abstract: The interplay between localized magnetic moments and itinerant electrons
gives rise to exotic quantum states in condensed matter systems.
Two-dimensional moire superlattices offer a powerful platform for engineering
heavy fermion states beyond conventional rare-earth intermetallic compounds.
While localized and itinerant carriers have been observed in twisted graphene
moire systems, direct evidence of their strong coupling--leading to artificial
heavy fermion states--has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate electrically
tunable heavy fermion in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, achieved by
controlling the Kondo hybridization between localized flatband electrons and
itinerant Dirac electrons via a displacement field. Our results reveal a
continuous quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic semimetal to a
paramagnetic heavy fermion metal, evidenced by a crossover from logarithmic to
quadratic temperature-dependent resistivity, a dramatic enhancement of
quasiparticle effective mass, and Fermi surface reconstruction near quantum
critical point. This highly tunable platform offers unprecedented control over
heavy fermion physics, establishing moire heterostructures as a versatile arena
for exploring correlated quantum phases--including potential unconventional
superconductivity--in two-dimensional materials.
