A promising candidate recently\nproposed is through randomly generated peaked circuits. In this work, we study\nan explicit construction for random peaked circuits: first selecting a random\ncircuit $C$ of polynomial size, which forms a $k$-design. Subsequently, a\nsecond random circuit $C'$ is chosen from the same architecture, subject to a\npostselection criterion: $C'$ must exhibit a high overlap with $C$ in one of\ntheir rows. Utilizing unitary design properties, we demonstrate that the\ncircuits generated by this method are non-trivial; specifically, $C'$ is\nprovably far from $C^\\dagger$. Indeed, with overwhelmingly high probability, a\nrandom peaked circuit generated this way is non-compressible and is of circuit\ncomplexity $\\tilde \\Omega(nk)$.

Observations of electron-paramagnetic resonance and direct systematic\nmeasurements of T2 has seen an anomaly where T2 increases with increasing\ntemperature. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that cause the T2\ntemperature anomaly.

As temperatures reach 120 - 160K,\nthe energy barrier gets high enough to slow the polaron hopping. At this point\nthe Larmor precession dominates, leading to decoherence. Our calculated\ntemperature-dependent coherence agrees with what has been seen experimentally,\ngiving a full theoretical framework for the mechanisms that cause the T2\ntemperature anomaly of increasing T2 with increasing temperature.

Yet, a\ntheoretical modeling of the decay dynamics of the interacting nuclear ensemble\nafter the impulsive excitation is still an open challenge. Here, we derive a\nset of nonlinear equations which is capable of efficiently modeling large\nnuclear ensembles for arbitrary degrees of excitation. As key signature for\nhigher excitation, we identify a non-linear time-evolution of the nuclear\ndipole phase, which can be tuned via the scattering geometry, and\ninterferometrically be measured. Furthermore, we identify interesting\nfinite-size effects in the nuclear dynamics of small ensembles. Our results\nprovide important guidance for future experiments aiming at the non-linear\nexcitation of nuclei. We further envision the exploration of finite\nsize-effects in M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy with highest spatial resolution, i.e.,\nsmall sample volumes."}

In this work, we introduce flexible catalysis, a generalization in\nwhich the catalyst is allowed to transform into a different auxiliary state,\nprovided it remains a valid catalyst. We show that this framework subsumes both\nstandard catalytic and multicopy transformations, and we analyze its advantages\nacross several classes of free operations. In particular, we prove that when\nthe free operations are local unitaries or permutation matrices, flexible\ncatalysis enables state extractions that are unattainable with standard\ncatalysis alone."}

While entanglement typically builds over\ntime when evolving a quantum system initialized in a product state, freezing\nthat information at any given instant requires quenching to a Hamiltonian with\nthe time-evolved state as an eigenstate, a concept we realize via an Emergent\nHamiltonian framework. While the Emergent Hamiltonian is generically non-local\nand may lack a closed form, we show examples where it is exact and local,\nthereby enabling, in principle, indefinite state storage limited only by\nexperimental imperfections. Unlike other phenomena, such as many-body\nlocalization, our method preserves both local and global properties of the\nquantum state. In some of our examples, we demonstrate that this protocol can\nbe used to store maximally entangled multi-qubit states, such as tensor\nproducts of Bell states, or fragile, globally distributed entangled states, in\nthe form of GHZ states, which are often challenging to initialize in actual\ndevices."}

In one\nformulation, each proposition is assigned a triplet $(t,f,u)$ indicating its\nstatus as true, false, or unsayable within a given context, with paraconsistent\nrules blocking triviality. In another, contexts are explicitly formalized\nthrough quantified conditionals, aligning directly with Bohr's view that\nmeaning derives from experimental arrangements.

Imposing symmetries and locality results in novel\nphenomena absent in ordinary quantum mechanical systems.

For the two-body problem, the Hamiltonian is perfectly described by\nSturm--Liouville (SL) theory. The effective two-body Hamiltonian is an SL\noperator on $(-1,1)$ whose spectral type is set by the edge behavior of the\npair inertia function $K(x)\\sim \\lvert x -x_\\mathrm{edge} \\rvert^{\\theta}$. We\nidentify a sharp transition at $\\theta=2$: for $\\theta<2$ the spectrum is\ndiscrete and wavepackets reflect from the edges, whereas for $\\theta>2$ the\nspectrum is continuous and wavepackets slow down and, dominantly, squeeze into\nasymptotically narrow regions at the edges. For three particles, the\ndifferential operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian is piecewise defined,\nrequiring several \"matching conditions\" which cannot be analyzed as easily. We\nproceed with a lattice regularization that preserves dipole conservation, and\nimplicitly selects a particular continuum Hamiltonian that we analyze\nnumerically.
