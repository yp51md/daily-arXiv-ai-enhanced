In this work, we study a broad class of renewal processes where a\nvariable's value changes according to a prescribed Probability Density Function\n(PDF), $p(\\xi)$, after random waiting times $\\theta$. This model is relevant\nacross many fields, including classical chaos, nonlinear hydrodynamics, quantum\ndots, cold atom dynamics, biological motion, foraging, and finance. We derive a\ngeneral analytical expression for the $n$-time correlation function by\naveraging over process realizations. Our analysis identifies the conditions for\nstationarity, aging, and long-range correlations based on the waiting time and\njump distributions. Among the many consequences of our analysis, two new key\nresults emerge. First, for Poissonian waiting times, the correlation function\nquickly approaches that of telegraphic noise. Second, for power-law waiting\ntimes with $\\mu>2$, , \\emph{any $n$-time correlation function asymptotically\nreduces to the two-time correlation evaluated at the earliest and latest time\npoints}. This second result reveals a universal long-time behavior where the\nsystem's full statistical structure becomes effectively two-time reducible.\nFurthermore, if the jump PDF $p(\\xi)$ has fat tails, this convergence becomes\nindependent of the waiting time PDF and is significantly accelerated, requiring\nonly modest increases in either the number of realizations or the trajectory\nlengths.

The prevailing understanding is\nthat the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long\nmean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size,\nthereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat\neffectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann\ntransport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture\nmode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon\npopulations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near\nNHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of\nlong-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons\nheat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient\nnear the NH and thereby enhancing TR.

Available\nthreshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and\nlimited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the\nnegative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the\nstatistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical\ncircuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a\ntransversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate.

As an application we study the non-unitary dynamics of a\nlossy or driven-dissipative BCS superconductors, evolving in presence of\ntwo-body losses and two-body pumps. We show that the non-Hermitian limit acts\nas a singular limit of the hybrid dissipative dynamics, leading to a sharp\nmodification of the universal approach to the driven-dissipative steady-states.\nBy considering the dissipative dynamics with pair losses, we show that, as the\nnon-Hermitian limit is approached, the density dynamics sharply evolves from a\nuniversal power-law to exponential decay that converges towards a quasi-steady\nplateau characterized by the freezing of the particle depletion due to pair\nlosses. The reached quasi-stationary density increases as a function of the\ndissipation rate highlighting the emergence of a non-Hermitian Zeno effect in\nthe lossy dynamics. For the driven-dissipative case, we show that, in the\nnon-Hermitian limit, the system gets trapped into an effective negative\ntemperature state, thus skipping the infinite temperature steady-state reached\nin the presence of finite contribution of the quantum jumps. We rationalize\nthese findings in terms of the conservation of the length of the pseudospins\nwhich, in the non-Hermitian limit, suppresses the effective single-particle\nlosses and pumps acting on the non-condensed particles."}

Deterministic non-resonant models are found, including spin systems\nin strong incommensurate lattice potentials. Consequently, quantum dynamics in\nnon-resonant potentials is asymptotically easier to simulate on both classical\nor quantum computers, compared to a generic many-body system."}

We present a numerically efficient\nframework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a\nmulti-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary\nshape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is\nbased on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the\nGreen's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within\na few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without\nrequiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the\nfull numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located\nin the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is\neasily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities."}

Typically, the answer to this question is\nsought in quantum correlations. In the present work, we show that quantum Otto\nengines that operate with nonlinear qubits significantly outperform linear\nengines. To this end, we develop a comprehensive thermodynamic description of\nnonlinear qubits starting with identifying the proper thermodynamic equilibrium\nstate. We then show that for ideal cycles as well as at maximum power the\nefficiency of the nonlinear engine is significantly higher. Interestingly,\nnonlinear dynamics can be thought of as an effective description of a\ncorrelated, complex quantum many body system. Hence, our findings corroborate\ncommon wisdom, while at the same time propose a new design of more efficient\nquantum engines."}

Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion\nof the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We\nfirst demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature\nafter the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For\na thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate\nequilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of\nadditional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy\nof necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical\nensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric\ninterpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner\nproduct: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench\nHamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal\ncomplement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results\nnumerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable\nmodels."}
