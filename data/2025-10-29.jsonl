However, signal attenuation,\nmolecular absorption, and severe propagation losses in THz channels pose\nsignificant challenges to reliable quantum state transmission and entanglement\ndistribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless QN architecture that\nleverages adaptive RIS elements capable of switching between active and passive\nmodes based on the incident signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These dynamic RIS\nelements enhance beamforming control over amplitude and phase, enabling robust\nredirection and compensation for THz-specific impairments. We develop a\ndetailed analytical model that incorporates key physical layer phenomena in THz\nquantum links, including path loss, fading, thermal noise, and alignment\nvariations. A secure optimization framework is formulated to jointly determine\nRIS placement and entanglement generation rate (EGR) allocation, while\nsatisfying fidelity, security, and fairness constraints under diverse quality\nof service (QoS) demands.

However, their working principle, based on Coriolis effects,\nhas become increasingly ineffective for addressing modern sensing challenges in\ncomplex scenarios. Fortunately, recent advancements in quantized SAWs offer a\npromising solution: SAWs operating at extremely low pump powers (approximately\nat the single-phonon level) can exhibit substantial quantum coherence, enabling\ninvestigations into the fundamental limits of SAW gyroscopes as constrained by\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty relation. In particular, when multiple SAWs couple\nto a common waveguide at distinct locations, the nonlocality arising from the\nspatial separation among coupling points induces directional coupling between\nthe SAWs. To elucidate this directionality, we propose a quantum gyroscope\ncharacterized by multiplepoint couplings. Unlike traditional single-point\ncoupling designs, our gyroscope exhibits distinctive time-delayed dynamics that\ndepend on the system's topologies. We emphasize that these dynamics invalidate\nthe Markovian approximation, even when the time delay is relatively small.\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of all possible topologies, we observe that\nthe directional coupling implies an inherent nonreciprocal transfer. This\nnonreciprocity confers signiffcant advantages to our gyroscope compared to\ntraditional designs, notably enhancing both the signal-to-noise ratio and\nsensitivity.

The\noptimization is carried out on the product-of-spheres normalization manifold\nand combines a manifold-preserving analytic line search, derived from a\nsecond-order energy expansion and validated along the exact normalized path,\nwith complementary Fourier-space kinetic and real-space diagonal\n(Hessian-inspired) preconditioners. The method enforces monotonic energy\ndescent and exhibits robust convergence across droplet, stripe, and supersolid\nregimes while retaining spectrally accurate discretizations and FFT-based\nevaluation of the dipolar term. In head-to-head benchmarks against\nimaginary-time evolution on matched grids and tolerances, the solver reduces\niteration counts by one to two orders of magnitude and overall\ntime-to-solution, and it typically attains slightly lower energies, indicating\nimproved resilience to metastability. We reproduce representative textures and\ndroplet-stability windows reported for dipolar mixtures. These results\nestablish a reliable and efficient tool for large-scale parameter scans and\nphase-boundary mapping, and for quantitatively linking numerically obtained\nmetastable branches to experimentally accessible states."}

We look for\nthe presence of this highly counterintuitive effect in the relaxation dynamics\nof the operators within the open quantum system setting. Since the operators\nevolve under a non-trace preserving map, the trace distance of an operator is\nnot a monotonically decaying function of time, unlike its quantum state\ncounterpart. Consequently, the trace distance can not serve as a reliable\nmeasure for detecting the Mpemba effect in operator dynamics. We circumvent\nthis problem by defining a \\textit{dressed} distance between operators that\ndecays monotonically with time, enabling a generalized framework to explore the\nMpemba-like effect for operators. Applying the formalism to various open\nquantum system settings, we find that, interestingly, in the single qubit case,\nonly accelerated relaxation of operators is possible, while genuine Mpemba-like\neffects emerge in higher-dimensional systems such as qutrits and beyond.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the existence of Mpemba-like effects in nonlocal,\nnon-equilibrium operators, such as current, in a double-quantum-dot setup. Our\nresults, besides offering fundamental insight about the occurrence of the\nMpemba-like effect under non-trace preserving dynamics, open avenues for new\nexperimental studies where quicker relaxation of observables could be of\nsignificant interest."}

Focusing on the Heisenberg chain in a deterministic\nAubry-Andr\\'{e} potential, we complement standard diagnostics by analyzing the\nstructure of long-distance pairwise correlations at high energy. Contrary to\nthe expectation that the ergodic-MBL transition in quasiperiodic systems should\nbe sharper due to the absence of Griffiths regions, we uncover a broad\nunconventional regime at strong quasiperiodic potential, characterized by\nfat-tailed distributions of longitudinal correlations at long distance. This\nreveals the presence of atypical eigenstates with strong long-range\ncorrelations in a regime where standard diagnostics indicate stable MBL. We\nfurther identify these anomalous eigenstates as quasi-degenerate pairs of\nresonant cat states, which exhibit entanglement at long distance. These\nfindings advance the understanding of quasiperiodic MBL and identify\ndensity-correlation measurements in ultracold atomic systems as a probe of\nlong-range resonances."}
