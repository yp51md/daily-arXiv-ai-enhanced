This circuit has a measurement-induced phase transition at $p=p_c$, separating a phase in which the entanglement entropy scales with the system size (a volume law state) and one in which it scales with the boundary (an area law state). We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases. The power law exponent is 1 in the volume law phase ($p < p_c$) and continuously decreases to 0 as $p \\to 1$ in the area law phase. We explain this behavior by studying the spatial distribution of entangled clusters. We find that the largest cluster of entangled qubits in these states has a fractal dimension between 0 and 1 and appears to be self-similar. Away from the critical point, this fractal dimension matches the entanglement depth power law exponent."}

This result thus extends the previous result that a discontinuous transition arises only when a link is added using the information of the cluster sizes attached to an infinite number of link candidates (global information) in the absence of rewiring."}

Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\\nabla T_y / \\nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios."}

We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms."}

In this paper, we introduce a variant of QAOA called dynamic depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DDQAOA) that resolves the challenge of pre selecting a fixed circuit depth. Our method adaptively expands circuit depth, starting from p = 1 and progressing up to p = 10, by transferring learned parameters to deeper circuits based on convergence criteria. We tested this approach on 100 instances of the Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP) at 10 qubit and 16 qubit scales. Our DDQAOA achieved superior approximation ratios and success probabilities with fewer CNOT gate evaluations than the standard QAOA for p = 3, 5, 10, and 15. In particular, while standard QAOA at p = 15 achieved results close to our approach, it used 217% and 159.3% more CNOT gates for 10 qubit and 16 qubit instances, respectively. This demonstrates the performance and practical applicability of DDQAOA to solve combinatorial optimization problems on near term devices."}

The formation of a nano-sized gap at a grain boundary facilitated a precisely controllable mechanical bending of the device by application of differential heating currents.

B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed."}

Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). The nearly linear and correlated temperature dependence of both parameters suggests a common underlying mechanism, namely, the orbital Hall effect in the light-metal layer, which governs both the generation of orbital current and its subsequent influence on the ferromagnet through orbital torque and orbital magnetoresistance."}

Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem."}

To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude. Quantitative agreement with measurements at all magnetic fields is restored by introducing a magnetic field noise model to describe lattice nuclear spins, with field-dependent noise amplitude in the range $δB\\sim 10\\,μ{\\rm T}- 1\\,{\\rm mT}$ for the copper porphyrin system. We show that while $T_1$ scales as $1/B$ experimentally due to a combination of spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, $T_2$ scales strictly as $ 1/B^2$ due to low-frequency dephasing processes associated with magnetic field noise. Our work demonstrates the potential of dynamical methods for modeling the open quantum system dynamics of molecular spin qubits."}

At small bias voltages, the tunneling occurs with conservation of energy and momentum at the points of intersection between two relatively shifted Fermi circles. Here, we experimentally found and theoretically described signatures of electron-hole asymmetric band structure of BLG: since holes are heavier, the tunneling conductance is enhanced at the hole doping due to the higher density of states. Another key feature of BLG that we explore is gap opening in a vertical electric field with a strong polarization of electron wave function at van Hove singularities near the gap edges. This polarization, by shifting electron wave function in one BLG closer to or father from the other BLG, gives rise to asymmetric tunneling resonances in the conductance around charge neutrality points, which result in strong sensitivity of the tunneling current to minor changes of the gate voltages. The observed phenomena are reproduced by our theoretical model taking into account electrostatics of the dual-gated structure, quantum capacitance effects, and self-consistent gap openings in both BLGs."}

Categorizing these displacements into a few groups based on their initial and final position allows us to measure irreversibility precisely without the need to know the forces and magnitude of the fluctuations acting on the system. Our model-free estimate of irreversibility is related to entropy production by a conditional fluctuation theorem and provides a lower bound to the average entropy production. We validate the method on single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments of proteins subject to force ramps. We show that irreversibility is sensitive to detailed features of the energy landscape underlying the protein folding dynamics and suggest how our methods can be employed to unveil key properties of protein folding processes."}

The defect is modeled by assigning complex-valued hopping amplitudes to the edges that connect the site corresponding to the mean position of the initial delocalized state to its nearest neighbors. We find that this single defective site is sufficient to enhance the ballistic spreading of an initially Gaussian wave packet. Extending these results, we implement a time-dependent alternation protocol between two distinct defect configurations, each individually yielding poor propagation of the state. The combination of these two unfavorable configurations improves the transport efficiency of the quantum walker, revealing a manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in CTQWs with delocalized initial states. This study provides new insights into the role of complex-phase defects and time-dependent protocols in CTQWs, demonstrating that the interplay between quantum interference and graph engineering can effectively enhance quantum transport in discrete lattices."}

[Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed."}

Heating is accelerated at intermediate driving frequencies, and the system eventually heats up to an infinite-temperature state. However, the heating time is extremely sensitive to different initial-state realizations and also follows a long-tailed power-law distribution. We show that a drive-induced short-range attractive interaction between monopoles is responsible for the long-tailed distributions observed in both monopole and heating dynamics."}

Since this equation involves an integrated history of past velocities, considerable efforts have been made to approximate this dynamics by data-driven Markov models, where auxiliary variables are used to compensate for the memory term. In recent works we have developed two algorithms which can be used for this purpose, provided the dynamics in question are scalar processes. Here we extend these algorithms to vector-valued processes. As a physical test bed we consider an S-shaped particle sliding on a planar substrate, which gives rise to a truly two-dimensional velocity process. The two algorithms provide Markov approximations of this process with 10-20 auxiliary variables and a very accurate fit of the given autocorrelation data over the entire time interval where these data are non-negligible."}

The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sample the positive P phase-space representation by analog complex-valued dynamical variables that are linked to the quantum operators. Statistical average over the stochastic trajectories yields the evolution of the quantum mechanical expectation values. However, numerical implementation of these SDEs for the TCM indicates divergent solutions, also known from other phase-space methods. This limits the applicability of the framework to finite propagation times, that are strongly dependent on the physical parameters and initial conditions of the system. We outline the underlying mathematical reason for these divergences and show that their contribution to the averages are, however, essential. To attempt to regularize the divergences, we transform the SDEs to an equivalent set of SDEs with different noise realisations, thereby pushing the valid time boundary. Quantum collapse and revival of the TCM, however, cannot be recovered by the stochastic trajectory approach, pointing to the general difficulty of the applicability of stochastic phase-space sampling methods to systems with strong quantum features."}

Resource requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) are daunting, and hence, compilation techniques must be designed to ensure resource efficiency. There is a growing need for compilation strategies tailored to the early FTQC regime, which refers to the first generation of fault-tolerant machines operating under stringent resource constraints of fewer physical qubits and limited distillation capacity. Present-day compilation techniques are largely focused on overprovisioning of routing paths and make liberal assumptions regarding the availability of distillation factories. Our work develops compilation techniques that are tailored to the needs of early FTQC systems, including distillation-adaptive qubit layouts and routing techniques. In particular, we show that simple greedy heuristics are extremely effective for this problem, offering up to 60% reduction in the number of qubits compared to prior works. Our techniques offer results with an average overhead of 1.2X in execution time for a 53% reduction in qubits against the theoretical lower bounds.

However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization."}

Heating is accelerated at intermediate driving frequencies, and the system eventually heats up to an infinite-temperature state.

First, using motility-induced phase separation as a paradigmatic example, we show how complex geometric features of clusters, captured by spatial cluster tomography, can be used to measure critical exponents in active systems without explicitly introducing system-specific order parameters. Second, we introduce temporal cluster tomography, an analogous cluster-based measurement that characterizes the dynamical behavior of active systems. We show that cluster dynamics can be captured by a generalization of burstiness analysis in complex temporal networks. Both spatial and temporal cluster tomography are easy to implement yet powerful approaches to study non-equilibrium systems, making them useful additions to the standard toolbox of statistical physics."}

Quantum teleportation offers a \"disembodied\" way of transferring particles through a virtual channel--quantum entanglement--which, in principle, could overcome the photon transmission loss. Experimentally, however, no previous quantum teleportation of single photons has shown a higher survival probability than using direct transmission. To overcome this challenge, here we first propose and demonstrate an all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons. Through an effective 15-dB channel loss, we realize a heralding efficiency of 82% for event-ready entangled photons. Based on the prior distributed entanglement, we demonstrate that teleportation-based transmission efficiency offers a 2.95-fold enhancement, compared to using direct transmission through the same channel, therefore establishing an unconditional teleportational advantage."}

We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases. The power law exponent is 1 in the volume law phase ($p < p_c$) and continuously decreases to 0 as $p \\to 1$ in the area law phase.

Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem."}

However, multipolar effects manifest strongly at coupling distances less than the nanoparticle size, while nonlocal optical effects stem from a size-induced dielectric response. We investigated these two important effects in the generation of two-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmonic coupling. A cavity quantum electrodynamic approach is employed, where the induced plasmonic effects lead to modified transition rates in the dynamics of the coupled quantum dot qubits.

In this work, we utilize a suite of techniques to construct compact and noise-resilient Fermion-to-qubit mappings suitable for general molecular Hamiltonians. Building on the Generalized Superfast Encoding (GSE) and other similar works, we demonstrate that it outperforms prior encodings in both accuracy and hardware efficiency for molecular simulations. Our improvements include path optimization within the Hamiltonian's interaction graph to minimize operator weight, introduction of multi-edge graph structures for enhanced error detection without added circuit depth, and a stabilizer measurement framework that directly maps logical terms and stabilizers to the Z-basis using Clifford simulation. Applying these methods to simulations of $(H_2)_2$ and $(H_2)_3$ systems yields significantly improved absolute and correlation energy estimates under realistic hardware noise, with further accuracy gains achieved by increasing code distance.

Brown"], "title": "Adaptive Estimation of Drifting Noise in Quantum Error Correction", "comment": "20 pages, 12 figures", "summary": "Advancing quantum information processors and building fault-tolerant architectures rely on the ability to accurately characterize the noise sources and suppress their impact on quantum devices. In practice, noise often drifts over time, whereas conventional noise characterization and decoding methods typically assume stationarity or provide only a time-average behavior of the noise. This treatment can result in suboptimal decoding performance. In this work, we present a rigorous analytical framework to capture time-dependent Pauli noise, by exploiting the syndrome statistics of quantum error correction experiments. We propose a sliding-window estimation method which allows us to recover the frequency components of the noise, by using optimal window sizes that we derive analytically. We prove the noise-filtering behavior of sliding windows, linking window size to spectral cutoff frequencies, and provide an iterative algorithm that captures multiple drift frequencies. We further introduce an overlapping window algorithm that enables us to capture rapid multi-frequency noise drifts in a single-pass fashion. Simulations for both phenomenological and circuit-level noise models validate our framework, demonstrating robust tracking of multi-frequency drift. The logical error rate obtained from our estimated models consistently align with the ground-truth logical error rate, and we find suppression of logical errors compared to static error models. Our window-based estimation methods and adaptive decoding offer new insights into noise spectroscopy and decoder optimization under drift using only syndrome data."}

To do so, we introduce a primitive notion of splitting maps within dagger symmetric monoidal categories. Splitting maps give rise to subsystems that admit comparison via a preorder called comprehension, and support an adaptation of the usual categorical trace. We show that the comprehension preorder precisely captures the inclusion partial order between Von Neumann algebras, and that the splitting map trace captures the natural notion of Von Neumann algebra trace. As a consequence of the development of these diagrammatic tools, we prove that the known equivalence between semi-causality and semi-localisability for factor subsystems extends to all (including non-factor) subsystems."}

However, only such strong quantum correlations enable quantum technologies, including quantum computing or communication, while revealing the limits of our classical worldview by violating local realism. Given its importance in modern quantum science, we present this tutorial addressing the questions: What is entanglement, how does it differ from classical correlations, and how can it be experimentally verified? Using celebrated examples, such as Schrödinger's cat, we highlight the distinction between classical and quantum correlations and illustrate the definition of entangled and separable states. We review entanglement criteria by discussing Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations for continuous variables and the CHSH inequality for discrete systems. Focusing on concepts of quantum correlations and operational entanglement witnesses, we provide accessible tools and illustrative examples aimed at demystifying entanglement for a broad readership."}

In this setting, quantum gates are realized by sequences of elementary braids of quasiparticles with exotic fractional statistics in certain two-dimensional topological condensed matter systems, described by effective topological quantum field theories. We specifically focus on a non-semisimple version of topological field theory, which provides a foundation for an extended theory of Ising anyons and which has recently been shown by Iulianelli et al., Nature Communications {\\bf 16}, 6408 (2025), to permit universal quantum computation. While the proofs of this pioneering result are existential in nature, the mixed integer programming provides an approach to explicitly construct quantum gates in topological systems. We demonstrate this by focusing specifically on the entangling controlled-NOT operation, and its local equivalence class, using braiding operations in the non-semisimple Ising system. This illustrates the utility of the Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming for topological quantum compilation."}

The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a \"Forrelation\" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.\n  Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a \"use once\" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel \"second quantization\" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof."}

However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets."}

To support this claim, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum $O(n)$ models on a lattice. In doing so, we also revisit two puzzling results in the literature on quantum $O(n)$ models, concerning universal scaling and equilibration, and demonstrate how these apparent contradictions can be resolved by properly accounting for lattice effects."}

The reflecting matter wave can interfere with the incident wave to form a detectable pattern, and this pattern contains information about atom-surface interactions at micrometer scales. We discuss how such an interferometer could be used to probe for anomalous short-range forces that are predicted by some beyond-standard model theories. We compare a simple analytical model for the anomalous phase to numerical solution of both the linear and non-linear Schrodinger equations, finding good agreement. With interactions, the phase does depend on the atomic density, which can be a source of noise. We nonetheless predict that under realistic conditions, the reflection technique can reach sensitivities approaching those obtained with macroscopic objects, and significantly improve the limits on anomalous coupling to atoms."}

Following the seminal work that reduced classical random matrix ensembles to a tridiagonal form, several efforts have aimed to generalize this framework to non-Hermitian extensions of the so-called \\b{eta}-ensembles. In particular, while the transition of eigenvalues from the real axis to the complex plane has been well characterized for the \\b{eta}-Hermite ensemble under symmetry breaking, the behavior of the \\b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble in a similar non-Hermitian setting remains\n  less understood. In this work, we investigate an ensemble of unstable matrices isospectral to the \\b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble. Introducing a small non-Hermitian perturbation breaks the symmetry and drives the eigenvalues into the complex plane. We derive analytical expressions for the loci of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs, which organize into a balloon-like structure in the complex plane, followed by a discrete finite line of real eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of these eigenvalues is analyzed in the large matrix-size limit, and our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations."}

[Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \\textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \\textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed."}
