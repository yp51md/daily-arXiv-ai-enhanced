Firstly,\nexploration is hindered over sharp minima, decreasing learning performance.\nSecondly, the steady gradient descent results in more stable and predictable\nmodel transmissions over wireless channels, making the model more susceptible\nto attacks from adversarial entities. Additionally, the local QFL model is\nvulnerable to noise produced by the quantum device's intermediate noise states,\nsince it requires the use of quantum gates and circuits for training. This\nlocal noise becomes intertwined with learning parameters during training,\nimpairing model precision and convergence rate. To address these issues, we\npropose a new QFL technique that incorporates differential privacy and\nintroduces a dedicated noise estimation strategy to quantify and mitigate the\nimpact of intermediate quantum noise. Furthermore, we design an adaptive noise\ngeneration scheme to alleviate privacy threats associated with the vanishing\ngradient variance phenomenon of QNN and enhance robustness against device\nnoise. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively balances\nconvergence, reduces communication costs, and mitigates the adverse effects of\nintermediate quantum noise while maintaining strong privacy protection.

The\nthree-body Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic\nrepresentation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is\nobtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate\ncoefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength\nwhere the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the\nthreshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally\naveraged $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence.

Preprocessing images from LPBF, riddled with\ndefects, presents challenges in training machine learning (ML) algorithms.\nDetecting defects is critical for predicting production quality and identifying\ncrucial points in artificial or natural structures. This paper introduces a\ndeep learning-based approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to\nautomatically detect and segment surface defects like cracks, spatter, holes,\nand pinholes on production surfaces. In contrast to traditional machine\nlearning techniques requiring extensive processing time and manual feature\ncrafting, deep learning proves more accurate. The proposed architecture\nundergoes training and testing on 14,982 labeled images annotated using the\nLabelImg tool. Each object in the images is manually annotated with bounding\nboxes and segmented masks. The trained CNN, coupled with OpenCV preprocessing\ntechniques, achieves an impressive 99.54% accuracy on the dataset with\nresolutions of 1536 x 1103 pixels.

However, for a small number of highly non-local observables, or\nwhen classical post-processing power is limited, the classical shadow method is\nnot always the most efficient choice. Here, we address this issue\nquantitatively by performing a full-stack resource analysis that compares\nclassical shadows with ``quantum footage,\" which refers to direct quantum\nmeasurement. Under certain assumptions, our analysis illustrates a boundary of\ndownload efficiency between classical shadows and quantum footage. For\nobservables expressed as linear combinations of Pauli matrices, the classical\nshadow method outperforms direct measurement when the number of observables is\nlarge and the Pauli weight is small. For observables in the form of large\nHermitian sparse matrices, the classical shadow method shows an advantage when\nthe number of observables, the sparsity of the matrix, and the number of qubits\nfall within a certain range. The key parameters influencing this behavior\ninclude the number of qubits $n$, observables $M$, sparsity $k$, Pauli weight\n$w$, accuracy requirement $\\epsilon$, and failure tolerance $\\delta$. We also\ncompare the resource consumption of the two methods on different types of\nquantum computers and identify break-even points where the classical shadow\nmethod becomes more efficient, which vary depending on the hardware.

In this work, we propose a robust and cost-effective\nquantum network using the Kramers-Kronig receiver. We first propose a\ncontinuous-variable QKD protocol based on direct detection without\ninterference, which achieves the recovery of quadrature components through the\nKramers-Kronig relation. Subsequently, we have extended this protocol to\ncontinuous-variable quantum access networks, further highlighting the\nrobustness and cost advantages of interference-free detection. The experimental\nresults show that each user can achieve a secret key rate at 55 kbit/s within\nthe access network range by using only one photodetector without interference\nstructures. This scheme opens up new possibilities in establishing a robust and\ncost-effective quantum network, serving as a foundational element in the\nprogress toward establishing a large-scale quantum internet."}

While decoding is a classical\npost-processing task, its effectiveness depends on accurately modeling quantum\nnoise, which is hardware-dependent. In particular, correlated bit-flip ($X$)\nand phase-flip ($Z$) errors often arise under circuit-level noise. We introduce\nthe Iterative Reweighting Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (IRMWPM) decoder,\nwhich systematically incorporates such correlations to enhance quantum error\ncorrection. Our method leverages fault-detection patterns to guide reweighting:\ncorrelated $X$ and $Z$ detection events are identified, and their conditional\nprobabilities update weights on the primal and dual lattices. This iterative\nprocedure improves handling of realistic error propagation in a\nhardware-agnostic yet noise-aware manner. We prove that IRMWPM converges in\nfinite time while preserving the distance guarantee of MWPM. Numerical results\nunder circuit-level noise show substantial improvements.
