This instability is captured by a quasi-universal\nspectral diagram, parameterized solely by the Gilbert damping, that predicts\nthe onset of deviations from rigid-wall behavior.

However, the advent of\nquantum electrodynamics (QED) and its remarkable success in describing\nlight-matter interactions at the microscopic level invites us to reconsider\nwhether interference-like effects could arise even when the waves do not\nphysically overlap. In this work, we extend the notion of wave interference to\na novel and unconventional regime. Building upon the fundamental description of\ninterference in terms of the interaction with the observer [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n134, 133603 (2025)], we demonstrate that interference-like phenomena can emerge\nwhen two independent fields interact with a single detector at different\nlocations in Minkowski space. We begin by developing a theoretical model in\nwhich a spatially extended atom simultaneously couples to two distant fields.\nWe then propose an experimentally feasible implementation using superconducting\ncircuits, where a giant artificial atom interacts with two independent\nresonators.
