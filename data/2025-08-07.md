### [1] [The Cost of Nonlocality: A Dynamical Performance Equation of Energy-Entanglement-Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03781)
*HongZheng Liu,YiNuo Tian,Zhiyue Wu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文通过结合量子速度极限和Lieb-Robinson界限，提出了一个“能量-纠缠性能方程”，用于量化局部相互作用系统中生成非局域纠缠的物理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是量化局部相互作用系统中生成非局域纠缠的物理成本，并连接理论计算复杂性与实验可观测性。

Method: 通过统一量子速度极限和Lieb-Robinson界限，建立“能量-纠缠性能方程”，引入可测量的复杂性代理。

Result: 揭示了“能量方差-纠缠乘积”、局部相互作用强度与动态效率之间的性能权衡，并定义了受理论界限约束的“性能前沿”。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅为实验基准提供了工具，还为识别过程性能瓶颈提供了新的诊断方法。

Abstract: This work aims to quantify the physical cost of generating non-local
entanglement in systems governed by local interactions. By unifying the quantum
speed limit and Lieb-Robinson bounds, we establish an "energy-entanglement
performance equation." This framework connects theoretical computational
complexity with experimental observables by introducing a measurable proxy for
complexity, thereby revealing a performance trade-off among the "energy
variance-entanglement product," the strength of local interactions, and
dynamical efficiency. Our work not only defines a "performance
frontier"-constrained by theoretical bounds and amenable to experimental
benchmarking-but also provides a novel diagnostic tool for identifying the
performance bottlenecks of a process.

### [2] [Do GNN-based QEC Decoders Require Classical Knowledge? Evaluating the Efficacy of Knowledge Distillation from MWPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03782)
*Ryota Ikeda*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 比较了两种基于GAT架构的量子纠错解码器模型，发现知识蒸馏并未显著提升性能，表明GNN能直接从硬件数据中高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证知识蒸馏是否能为GNN在量子纠错解码器中带来性能提升。

Method: 使用GAT架构，比较纯数据驱动模型与结合MWPM理论知识的蒸馏模型。

Result: 蒸馏模型与基线模型测试精度相近，但训练更慢且耗时增加五倍。

Conclusion: 现代GNN可直接从硬件数据中高效学习，无需依赖理论模型指导。

Abstract: The performance of decoders in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to
realizing practical quantum computers. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies
are not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring
theoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect
Matching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can
effectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT)
architecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first
is a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels,
while the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the
theoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from
Google, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the
knowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training
loss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of
approximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess
a high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from
real hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models.

### [3] [Probing and Enhancing the Robustness of GNN-based QEC Decoders with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03783)
*Ryota Ikeda*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用强化学习（RL）代理系统性地探测图神经网络（GNN）解码器在量子纠错（QEC）中的脆弱性的框架，并通过对抗训练提升其鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GNN解码器在对抗性扰动下的鲁棒性，以提升量子计算中神经解码器的可靠性。

Method: 使用RL代理作为对手，寻找最小化综合征修改以导致解码器误分类，并应用于实验表面码数据。

Result: RL代理成功识别关键漏洞，攻击成功率高；对抗训练显著提升解码器鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 自动化漏洞发现与针对性再训练为开发更可靠的神经解码器提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach
for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise
characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these
decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open
question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the
vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The
RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome
modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code
data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can
successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high
attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through
adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples
generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability
discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for
developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant
quantum computing.

*Harshvardhan K. Babla,James D. Teoh,Jahan Claes,Daniel K. Weiss,Shraddha Singh,Robert J. Schoelkopf,Shruti Puri*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于四腿猫码和XZZX码的平面容错架构，通过融合纠错实现，显著降低了硬件复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决玻色模式中的单光子损失问题，并首次实现超越盈亏平衡点的量子纠错。

Method: 将四腿猫码与XZZX码通过融合纠错进行级联，利用标准电路-QED技术实现资源态制备和贝尔测量。

Result: 硬件级纠错有效抑制了主要错误，外部的XZZX码只需处理二次抑制的残余错误，从而加倍容错距离。

Conclusion: 该架构显著降低了实现四腿猫码容错所需的硬件复杂度，且不受非线性限制。

Abstract: The four-legged cat code is a quantum error-correcting code designed to
address the predominant error in bosonic modes: single-photon loss. It was the
first such code to surpass the break-even point, thereby demonstrating the
practical utility of quantum error correction. In this work, we propose a
planar fault-tolerant architecture for this code by concatenating it with the
XZZX code via fusion-based error-correction. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first 2D nearest-neighbor architecture for fault-tolerant fusion-based
error-correction. We demonstrate how all the required operations, namely
resource state preparation and Bell measurements, can be carried out using
standard circuit-QED techniques, such as intercavity beam-splitter coupling,
cavity displacements, cavity-transmon dispersive coupling, and transmon drives.
We show analytically and numerically that all dominant hardware errors in the
bosonic modes and control ancillae are corrected, to first-order, at the
hardware level. Consequently, the outer XZZX code only needs to address smaller
residual errors, which are quadratically suppressed, effectively doubling the
architecture's fault-distance. Moreover, the performance of our architecture is
not limited by unwanted nonlinearities such as cavity self-Kerr, and it avoids
demanding coupling techniques like $\chi$-matching or high-order coupling.
Overall, our architecture substantially reduces the hardware complexity needed
to achieve fault tolerance with the four-legged cat code.

### [5] [QPing: a Quantum Ping Primitive for Quantum Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03806)
*Jorge Miguel-Ramiro,Jessica Illiano,Francesco Mazza,Alexander Pirker,Julia Freund,Angela Sara Cacciapuoti,Marcello Caleffi,Wolfgang Dür*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子Ping（QPing）是一种用于未来量子网络的诊断原语，用于评估节点间能否高效建立量子纠缠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子网络的连通性依赖于共享纠缠的可用性和质量，需要一种类似经典Ping的量子诊断工具。

Method: 开发了QPing的正式框架，利用序贯假设检验等方法，提出主动（路径和分段）和被动（预共享纠缠）策略。

Result: QPing可作为量子网络的灵活诊断模块，适应不同架构和协议设计。

Conclusion: QPing是量子网络的重要诊断工具，具有高效性和适应性。

Abstract: We introduce the concept of Quantum Ping (QPing) as a diagnostic primitive
for future quantum networks, designed to assess whether two or more end nodes
can establish practical quantum entanglement with efficient resource
consumption, limited overhead, and time-adaptive fidelity thresholds. Unlike
classical ping, which probes network-layer connectivity through ICMP messages,
our proposed quantum version is adapted to the unique features of quantum
networks, where connectivity depends on the availability and quality of shared
entanglement. We develop a formal framework for QPing and leverage different
tools such as sequential hypothesis testing to probe quantum connectivity. We
present several strategies, including active strategies, with path-based and
segment-based variants, and passive strategies that utilize pre-shared
entangled resources. QPing can serve as a flexible diagnostic building block
for quantum networks, designed to work alongside fundamental network
operations, while remaining suitable to different architectural and protocol
design approaches.

### [6] [One-dimensional quantum droplets under linear gravitational-like trap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03825)
*Saurab Das,Jayanta Bera,Ajay Nath*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了一维量子液滴在恒定和时变线性引力势下的行为，发现液滴下落速度仅与引力势强度相关，时变势会导致轨迹偏差，适用于精密重力测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子液滴在引力势下的动力学特性及其在量子传感中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用扩展的GPE模型，结合EMF和BMF修正，分析液滴波函数及有效相互作用。

Result: 液滴下落速度与引力势强度相关，时变势引起轨迹偏差；熵和Wigner分布揭示了相干性特征。

Conclusion: 研究为超稀量子流体在量子传感和计量学中的应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate the influence of a constant and time-dependent linear
gravitational-like potential on one-dimensional quantum droplets (QDs),
governed by an extended GPE incorporating a repulsive cubic effective
mean-field (EMF) term and an attractive quadratic beyond-mean-field (BMF)
correction. Within a tailored external confinement, we analytically
characterize the QDs wavefunction and derive the effective interaction
contributions. Analogous to classical Newtonian dynamics, the falling velocity
of the droplet within a finite domain is found to depend solely on the strength
of the linear gravitational like potential, remaining independent of both the
total atom number and the magnitude of EMF nonlinearity. When the linear
potential is temporally modulated, deviations in the trajectory of the droplet
emerge relative to the static case, indicating potential applicability in
precision gravimetry. To further probe the dynamical coherence properties, we
compute the Shannon entropy and the Wigner quasi-probability distribution. Both
measures reveal distinct signatures of the constant and time varying linear
potential, with the modulation strength directly influencing the phase-space
localization and coherence structure of the droplet. Numerical simulations
substantiate the stability of the analytical solutions, demonstrating their
robustness. These findings suggest promising implications for quantum sensing
and metrological applications using ultradilute quantum fluids.

### [7] [The Covariant Relativistic Derivation of De Broglie Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03908)
*Samuel Bueno Soltau*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文追溯了德布罗意关系的历史发展，从普朗克和爱因斯坦的量子假说到其协变相对论推导，重点通过四动量形式从狭义相对论原理直接推导德布罗意关系。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨德布罗意关系的历史背景和理论基础，强调相对论力学在波粒二象性中的一致性。

Method: 通过历史回顾和四动量形式从狭义相对论原理直接推导德布罗意关系，并与启发式方法进行比较。

Result: 相对论方法展现了德布罗意关系的普遍性和概念一致性。

Conclusion: 相对论力学为波粒二象性提供了更一致的基础，量子场论视角进一步强化了这一结论。

Abstract: This paper provides an examination of the de Broglie relation, tracing its
historical development from the quantum hypotheses proposed by Planck and
Einstein to its covariant relativistic derivation. The discussion begins by
situating de Broglie's seminal insight within the early framework of quantum
theory. We then reconstruct his original heuristic derivation. The primary
focus of this work, however, is the derivation of the de Broglie relation
directly from the principles of special relativity, employing the four-momentum
formalism. A comparative analysis between the heuristic and relativistic
approaches underscores the universality and conceptual coherence of the latter.
The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of relativistic mechanics
in establishing a consistent foundation for wave-particle duality, further
reinforcing this through a quantum field theoretical perspective.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对量子纠错电路的编译方案，显著提升了执行速度和逻辑错误率。

Conclusion: 专用编译方案能显著优化量子纠错电路的性能，适用于模块化离子阱系统。

Abstract: One of the most promising paths towards large scale fault tolerant quantum
computation is the use of quantum error correcting stabilizer codes. Just like
every other quantum circuit, these codes must be compiled to hardware in a way
to minimize the total physical error introduced into the system, for example
either due to high latency execution or excessive gates to meet connectivity
limitations of the target hardware. However, unlike arbitrary quantum circuits,
all syndrome extraction circuits have several common properties, for example
they have a bipartite connectivity graph, consist only of commuting
subcircuits, among other properties. For the most part, compilation methods
have aimed at being generic, able to map any input circuit into executables on
the hardware, and therefore cannot appropriately exploit these properties and
result in executables which have higher physical error. In the case of modular
trapped ion systems, specifically QCCDs, this corresponds to the insertion of
excessive shuttling operations necessary to realize arbitrary qubit
interactions. We propose a compilation scheme explicitly tailored for the
structural regularity of QEC circuits based on several key observations: 1.
only ancilla or data (but not both) should be shuttled, 2. stabilizers can be
executed in any order meaning we can dynamically modify circuit execution on a
per-cycle basis 3. ancilla are indistinguishable meaning any can be selected to
begin a stabilizer measurement and retain a fixed-point mapping between cycles,
and 4. QCCD hardware limits the number of parallel operations equal to the
number traps in the system, meaning fewer ancilla are necessary and can be
reused. Our resulting compiler, leads to QEC circuits which are on average
3.38x faster to execute, and lead to up to two orders of magnitude of
improvement in logical error rates with realistic physical error rates.

Result: 证明了该原理的普适性，并展示了其在热力学和复杂多体系统之外的潜在应用。

Conclusion: 最大通道熵原理为量子动力学建模提供了新方法，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: A many-body system, whether in contact with a large environment or evolving
under complex dynamics, can typically be modeled as occupying the thermal state
singled out by Jaynes' maximum entropy principle. Here, we find analogous
fundamental principles identifying a noisy quantum channel $\mathcal{T}$ to
model the system's dynamics, going beyond the study of its final equilibrium
state. Our maximum channel entropy principle states that $\mathcal{T}$ should
maximize the channel's entropy, suitably defined, subject to any available
macroscopic constraints. These may correlate input and outputs, and may lead to
restricted or partial thermalizing dynamics including thermalization with
average energy conservation. This principle is reinforced by an independent
extension of the microcanonical derivation of the thermal state to channels,
which leads to the same $\mathcal{T}$. Our technical contributions include a
derivation of the general mathematical structure of $\mathcal{T}$, a custom
postselection theorem relating an arbitrary permutation-invariant channel to
nearby i.i.d. channels, as well as novel typicality results for quantum
channels for noncommuting constraints and arbitrary input states. We propose a
learning algorithm for quantum channels based on the maximum channel entropy
principle, demonstrating the broader relevance of $\mathcal{T}$ beyond
thermodynamics and complex many-body systems.

Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and
unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an
important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a
pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised
machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a
bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two
theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path
planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change
and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections,
fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are
more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed
kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum
phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's
toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their
superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow
kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived
and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key
concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and
machine learning of topological quantum order.

Conclusion: 该方法为三维固体的量子化学计算提供了可行替代方案，并可无缝整合现有原子和分子量子化学方法。

Abstract: We present a general theory to treat periodic solids with quantum-chemistry
methods. It relies on two main developments: 1) the modeling of a solid as a
Clifford torus which is a torus that is both periodic and flat and 2) the
introduction of a periodic gaussian basis set that is compatible with the
topology of the Clifford torus. We illustrate our approach by calculating the
ground-state energy of a periodic chain of hydrogen atoms within both
Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster theory. We demonstrate that our approach
yields the correct ground-state energy in the thermodynamic limit by comparing
it to the ground-state energy of a ring of hydrogen atoms in the same limit.
Since equivalent ring-like calculations for three-dimensional solids are
impossible, our approach is an excellent alternative to perform
quantum-chemistry calculations of solids. Our Clifford formalism can be
seamlessly combined with current implementations of quantum-chemistry methods
designed for atoms and molecules to make them applicable to solids.

Result: 证明了热通道的指数形式，并展示了其在量子通道学习中的应用。

Conclusion: 热通道的概念在多个领域具有潜在应用价值，为量子通道的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The thermal state plays a number of significant roles throughout physics,
information theory, quantum computing, and machine learning. It arises from
Jaynes' maximum-entropy principle as the maximally entropic state subject to
linear constraints, and is also the reduced state of the microcanonical state
on the system and a large environment. We formulate a maximum-channel-entropy
principle, defining a thermal channel as one that maximizes a channel entropy
measure subject to linear constraints on the channel. We prove that thermal
channels exhibit an exponential form reminiscent of thermal states. We study
examples including thermalizing channels that conserve a state's average
energy, as well as Pauli-covariant and classical channels. We propose a quantum
channel learning algorithm based on maximum channel entropy methods that
mirrors a similar learning algorithm for quantum states. We then demonstrate
the thermodynamic relevance of the maximum-channel-entropy channel by proving
that it resembles the action on a single system of a microcanonical channel
acting on many copies of the system. Here, the microcanonical channel is
defined by requiring that the linear constraints obey sharp statistics for any
i.i.d. input state, including for noncommuting constraint operators. Our
techniques involve convex optimization methods to optimize recently introduced
channel entropy measures, typicality techniques involving noncommuting
operators, a custom channel postselection technique, as well as Schur-Weyl
duality. As a result of potential independent interest, we prove a constrained
postselection theorem for quantum channels. The widespread relevance of the
thermal state throughout physics, information theory, machine learning, and
quantum computing, inspires promising applications for the analogous concept
for quantum channels.

Conclusion: 该算法具有可扩展性，适用于大分子系统，且仅需固定数量的光学组件。

Abstract: Accurately simulating molecular vibronic spectra remains computationally
challenging due to the exponential scaling of required calculations. Here, we
show that employing the linear coupling model within the gaussian boson
sampling framework effectively addresses this limitation. We implement the
algorithm for simulating the pentacene molecule through three distinct
approaches, using numerical simulation on a classical computer and
experimentally using two optical setups equipped with different photon
detectors (SNSPD and SPAD). High fidelity $(F>0.999)$ was achieved between the
simulated Franck-Condon profiles and analytically calculated profiles obtained
by enumerating all possible transitions within the linear coupling model.
Furthermore, simulations were performed for larger molecular systems using 48
vibrational modes of naphthalene and 64 vibrational modes of anthracene.
Comparison with experimental data confirms that the simulated spectra
accurately reproduce both the positions and shapes of the measured spectral
bands. A notable advantage of our algorithm is its scalability, requiring only
a fixed minimal set of optical components irrespective of the size of the
studied system.

Abstract: Quantum transport plays a central role in both fundamental physics and the
development of quantum technologies. While significant progress has been made
in understanding transport phenomena in quantum systems, methods for optimizing
transport properties remain limited, particularly in complex quantum networks.
Building on recent advances in classical network optimization via the
generalized Doob transform, we introduce a novel method that extends this
approach to quantum networks. Our framework leverages a single diagonalization
of the system generator to efficiently tailor both the Hamiltonian and
dissipative contributions, optimizing transport observables such as currents
and activities. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through extensive
numerical explorations, showing that optimal performance arises from
non-trivial modifications to both coherent and incoherent dynamics. We also
assess the robustness of the optimization under constraints that preserve
specific physical features, such as fixed dissipative structures and
input-output interactions. Finally, we discuss the connection between optimized
transport and centrosymmetry, highlighting the relevance of this property for
enhanced transport efficiency in quantum systems.

Abstract: Nonreciprocity-the ability to transmit signals in one direction while
blocking them in the reverse-has become a powerful resource in quantum
technologies, enabling directional amplification, routing of quantum
information, and topologically protected quantum states. Recent experimental
advances have demonstrated nonreciprocal behavior in low-loss, fully integrated
devices operating with weak or no magnetic bias, enabled by synthetic gauge
fields, optomechanical interactions, and chiral light-matter coupling. These
achievements overcome the limitations of more traditional approaches, making
nonreciprocity compatible with superconducting circuits and scalable quantum
photonic architectures as well as an integral part of the next generation of
modular quantum computers, distributed quantum networks, and precision
metrology. Here we highlight the key concepts for engineering nonreciprocity in
quantum systems and describe how this functionality can be employed for
high-fidelity qubit readout, robust quantum state transfer, and boosting the
sensitivity of quantum sensors.

Abstract: We introduce a graphical calculus, consisting of a set of fermionic tensors
with tensor-network equations, which can be used to perform various
computations in fermionic many-body physics purely diagrammatically. The
indices of our tensors primarily correspond to fermionic modes, but also
include qubits and fixed odd-parity states. Our graphical calculus extends the
ZX calculus for systems involving qubits. We apply the calculus in order to
represent various objects, operations, and computations in physics, including
fermionic Gaussian states, the partial trace of Majorana modes, purification
protocols, fermionization and bosonization maps, and the construction of
fermionic codes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管transmon量子比特通常被认为对电荷噪声不敏感，但局部电荷环境会影响其退相干时间。通过实验发现，电荷偏移与退相干时间波动相关，且奇偶性切换事件会进一步影响退相干时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索transmon量子比特退相干时间波动的原因，尤其是局部电荷环境的影响，以改进量子计算设备的性能。

Method: 采用单次测量方法检测奇偶性切换事件，并将其嵌入Ramsey测量中，分析退相干时间与电荷偏移的关系。

Result: 实验表明，保持相同奇偶性状态的事件具有更高的退相干时间，且transmon量子比特可能受电荷噪声限制。

Conclusion: 奇偶性切换速率应作为设备表征的重要指标，transmon量子比特的性能优化需考虑电荷噪声的影响。

Abstract: Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their
engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation
times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in
dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same
device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise.
However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of
dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations
in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While
charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to
the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement
a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which
are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in
the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both
parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even
with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must
be considered as a device characterization metric.

Conclusion: 新方法资源效率显著优于现有方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The ability to efficiently state-prepare Gaussian distributions is critical
to the success of numerous quantum algorithms. The most popular algorithm for
this subroutine (Kitaev-Webb) has favorable polynomial resource scaling,
however it faces enormous resource overheads making it functionally
impractical. In this paper, we present a new, more intuitive method which uses
exactly $n-1$ rotations, $(n-1)(n-2)/2$ two-qubit controlled rotations, and
$\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor$ ancilla to state-prepare an $n$-qubit Gaussian state.
We then apply optimizations to the circuit to render it linear in T-depth. This
method can be extended to state-preparations of complex functions with
polynomial phase.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a promising framework in high-energy physics, in

to querying directed acyclic graphs in graph theory. In this paper, we present
the Minimum Clique-optimised quantum Algorithm (MCA), an automated quantum
algorithm designed to efficiently query the causal structures within the
Loop-Tree Duality. The MCA quantum algorithm is optimised by exploiting graph
theory techniques, specifically, by analogy with the Minimum Clique Partition
problem. The evaluation of the MCA quantum algorithm is exhibited by analysing
the transpiled quantum circuit depth and quantum circuit area.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models are designed for performing learning tasks.
Some quantum classifier models are proposed to assign classes of inputs based
on fidelity measurements. Quantum Hadamard test is a well-known quantum
algorithm for computing these fidelities. However, the basic requirement for
deploying the quantum Hadamard test maps input space to L2-normalize vector
space. Consequently, computed fidelities correspond to cosine similarities in
mapped input space. We propose a quantum Hadamard test with the additional
capability to compute the inner product in bounded input space, which refers to
the Generalized Quantum Hadamard test. It incorporates not only
L2-normalization of input space but also other standardization methods, such as
Min-max normalization. This capability is raised due to different quantum
feature mapping and unitary evolution of the mapped quantum state. We discuss
the quantum circuital implementation of our algorithm and establish this
circuit design through numerical simulation. Our circuital architecture is
efficient in terms of computational complexities. We show the application of
our algorithm by integrating it with two classical machine learning models:
Logistic regression binary classifier and Centroid-based binary classifier and
solve four classification problems over two public-benchmark datasets and two
artificial datasets.

Conclusion: 惰性重合成技术不仅提升了基于表格的量子电路优化算法的质量和性能，还表现出比其他方法更高的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum circuit optimization (QCO) algorithms for T-count
reduction often lead to a substantial increase in two-qubit gate count
(2Q-count) -- a drawback that existing 2Q-count optimization techniques
struggle to address effectively. In this work, we propose a novel lazy
resynthesis approach for modern tableau-based QCO flows that significantly
mitigates the 2Q-gate surges commonly introduced during T-count optimization in
Clifford+T circuits. Experimental results show that our approach reduces
2Q-count overhead by 54.8%, 15.3%, and 68.0% compared to tableau-based,
ZX-calculus-based, and path-sum-based QCO algorithms, respectively. In terms of
runtime, our method achieves speedups of 1.81$\times$ and 13.1$\times$ over the
tableau-based and ZX-calculus-based methods, while performing comparably to the
path-sum-based approach. In summary, the proposed lazy resynthesis technique
not only enhances the quality and performance of tableau-based QCO algorithms
but also demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability compared to
alternative QCO approaches such as ZX-calculus and path-sum-based techniques.

Abstract: Independent control of numerous electrodes in quantum charge-coupled device
architectures presents a significant challenge for wiring and hardware
scalability. To address this issue, we demonstrate a voltage control method
based on time-division multiplexing (TDM). This approach utilizes a single
high-update-rate digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to sequentially generate
control signals for multiple electrodes, thereby reducing both the number of
required DACs and associated wiring. We experimentally validate this concept by
developing a 10-channel system that operates with only two DACs. The developed
TDM-based voltage control system is applied to a surface-electrode trap, where
we successfully trap a single $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion. This approach offers a
resource-efficient and scalable solution for advanced quantum computing systems
based on trapped ions.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are
still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques
remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the
meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum
circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical
processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor
executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and
expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant
message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid
quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties
of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the
message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations
driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature
structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings
demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could
deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative,
suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials
modeling.

Abstract: We conducted a systematic survey of emerging quantum-HPC platforms, which

through co-location. Currently, it remains unclear whether such platforms
provide tangible benefits for near-future industrial applications. To address
this, we examined the impact of co-location on latency reduction, bandwidth

Abstract: The integration of quantum computers within classical High-Performance

However, combining HPC and quantum computers presents significant technical
challenges, including resource allocation. This paper presents a novel

Result: 静态优化器无法解决简单的4节点最短路径问题，QRL在动态8节点环境中表现与随机行为无异。

Conclusion: 当前量子算法面临优化复杂性和学习不稳定性等关键障碍，需进一步研究以解决这些问题。

Abstract: Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic
satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum
computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major
approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for
offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for
online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these
algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are
unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the
complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on
policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic
8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative
findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum
algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the
underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning
instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.

Abstract: The discard ZX-calculus is known to be complete and universal for mixed-state
quantum mechanics, allowing for both quantum and classical processes. However,
if the quantum aspects of ZX-calculus have been explored in depth, little work
has been done on the classical side. In this paper, we investigate a fragment
of discard ZX-calculus obtained by decohering the usual generators of
ZX-calculus. We show that this calculus is universal and complete for affinely
supported probability distributions over $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$. To do so, we
exhibit a normal form, mixing ideas from the graphical linear algebra program
and diagrammatic Fourier transforms. Our results both clarify how to handle
hybrid classical-quantum processes in the discard ZX-calculus and pave the way
to the picturing of more general random variables and probabilistic processes.

Abstract: While cavity-magnon hybridization offers intriguing physics, its practical
implementation is hindered by intrinsic damping in both cavity and magnon
modes, leading to short coherence times and constrained applications. Recently,
with the emergence of tunable external gain at the macroscopic scale, the
research focus has shifted from purely lossy systems to gain-loss balanced
non-Hermitian systems. Here, we propose a pseudo-Hermitian model with two
magnon and two cavity modes coupled via phase-dependent interaction. We link
the energy spectrum to phase transitions, observing exceptional points when
pseudo-Hermitian symmetry breaks. We also observed level attraction and level
repulsion. The former corresponds to four phase transitions and manifests as a
double Z-shaped energy spectrum, the latter corresponds to two phase
transitions, with the repulsive gap depending on the coupling phase. In the
phase diagram defined by non-Hermiticity and coupling phase, we reveal a
distinctive correspondence: pseudo-Hermitian symmetry breaking is intrinsically
linked to coupling mode transitions, enabling new strategies for controlling
hybrid quantum states in spintronic systems.

Abstract: We establish a sharp quantum advantage in determining the parity (even/odd)
of an unknown permutation applied to any number $n \ge 3$ of particles.
Classically, this is impossible with fewer than~$n$ labels, being the success
limited to random guessing. Quantum mechanics does it with certainty with as
few as $\lceil \sqrt{n}\, \rceil$ distinguishable states per particle, thanks
to entanglement. Below this threshold, not even quantum mechanics helps: both
classical and quantum success are limited to random guessing. For small $n$, we
provide explicit expressions for states that ensure perfect parity
identification. We also assess the minimum entanglement these states need to
carry, finding it to be close to maximal, and even maximal in some cases. The
task requires no oracles or contrived setups and provides a simple, rigorous
example of genuine quantum advantage.

Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas beam sources have become an essential tool for
experiments requiring cold molecular beams with low forward velocities.
Although recent experimental advances have led to significant progress in
source optimization, numerical studies remain limited due to the challenges
posed by the large parameter ranges required to describe both the dense buffer
gas and the dilute seed molecules. In this work, we report a numerical
evaluation of cryogenic buffer gas beam cells operating in the hydrodynamic
extraction regime. While most prior studies focused on box-like or cylindrical
cells, we investigated hydrodynamic effects including vortex formation in a
spherical cell and assessed whether these could be utilized to enhance the
performance in molecule cooling and extraction. To achieve this, we performed
steady-state slip-flow simulations for helium buffer gas and employed a
direct-simulation Monte Carlo diffusion routine to track particle trajectories.
We compared the performance of the source across different buffer gas
throughputs and injection angles and identified parameter regimes where vortex
formation enhances molecule extraction. From the simulations, we extracted
experimental observables, which allow these effects to be verified through
velocity or time-of-flight measurements on the molecular beam.

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing represents at present one of the most promising
approaches to scaling quantum processors. Current implementations typically
partition circuits into multiple cores, each composed of several qubits, with
inter-core connectivity playing a central role in ensuring scalability.
Identifying the optimal configuration -- defined as the arrangement that
maximizes circuit complexity with minimal depth -- thus constitutes a
fundamental design challenge. In this work, we demonstrate, both analytically
and numerically, the existence of a universal optimal configuration for
distributing single and two qubit gates across arbitrary intercore
communication topologies in variational distributed circuits. Our proof is
based on a complexity measure based on Markov matrices, which quantifies the
convergence rate toward the Haar measure, as introduced by Weinstein et al.
Finally, we validate our predictions through numerical comparisons with the
well established majorization criterion proposed in Ref 2.

Abstract: The effects of noise are one of the most important factors to consider when
it comes to quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing
(NISQ) era that we are currently in. Therefore, it is important not only to
gain more knowledge about the noise sources appearing in current quantum
computing hardware in order to suppress and mitigate their contributions, but
also to evaluate whether a given quantum algorithm can achieve reasonable
results on a given hardware. To accomplish this, we need noise models that can
describe the real hardware with sufficient accuracy. Here, we present a noise
model that has been evaluated on superconducting hardware platforms and could
be adapted to other common architectures such as trapped-ion or neutral atom
devices. We then benchmark our model by simulating a 20-qubit superconducting

Motivation: 研究旨在比较经典和量子启发的序列模型在预测短信活动时间序列中的性能，探索量子模块的适用性。

Method: 使用五种模型（LSTM、QLSTM、QASA、QRWKV、QFWP）在不同输入序列长度下预测短信活动，比较其表现。

Result: 不同模型对序列长度的敏感性不同，量子增强并非普遍有效，效果取决于具体任务和架构设计。

Conclusion: 量子模块的有效性依赖于任务和设计，需权衡模型大小、参数策略和时间建模能力。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired
sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS
activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to
data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for
each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM
(QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted
Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying
input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to
predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values
within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models
exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum
enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of
quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural
design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization
strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.

Conclusion: 宽量子神经网络在经典算法下可被高效模拟，无法超越经典计算能力。

Abstract: We propose an efficient classical algorithm to estimate the Neural Tangent
Kernel (NTK) associated with a broad class of quantum neural networks. These
networks consist of arbitrary unitary operators belonging to the Clifford group
interleaved with parametric gates given by the time evolution generated by an
arbitrary Hamiltonian belonging to the Pauli group. The proposed algorithm
leverages a key insight: the average over the distribution of initialization
parameters in the NTK definition can be exactly replaced by an average over
just four discrete values, chosen such that the corresponding parametric gates
are Clifford operations. This reduction enables an efficient classical
simulation of the circuit. Combined with recent results establishing the
equivalence between wide quantum neural networks and Gaussian processes
[Girardi \emph{et al.}, Comm. Math. Phys. 406, 92 (2025); Melchor Hernandez
\emph{et al.}, arXiv:2412.03182], our method enables efficient computation of
the expected output of wide, trained quantum neural networks, and therefore
shows that such networks cannot achieve quantum advantage.

Result: 检测到均匀的压缩效果（-6.5至-7 dB），表明OPA在光谱多模压缩检测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了OPA在光谱域的应用，推动了基于光谱模式的高维光子量子技术的发展。

Abstract: Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional photonic
quantum technologies, enabling applications in quantum-enhanced sensing,
quantum communication, and quantum computing. Efficient detection of such a
multimode squeezed state is essential for unlocking its full potential. Optical
parametric amplification (OPA) has recently gained attention as a powerful
technique offering loss-tolerant, direct broadband detection, and multimode
operation. While OPA has been used to characterize spatially multimode
squeezing, its application to spectrally multimode squeezing has not yet been
demonstrated. Here, we report on the first experimental demonstration of
spectrally multimode squeezing detection using OPA. We achieve simultaneous
detection of squeezing across more than 60 spectral modes of a broadband
squeezed vacuum state. The observed squeezing is nearly uniform, ranging from
-6.5 to -7 dB, which makes the source particularly suitable for constructing
continuous-variable cluster states, and indicates the multimode capability of
the OPA. The results extend the capabilities of OPA detection into the spectral
domain, advancing spectral-mode-based high-dimensional photonic quantum
technologies.

Abstract: The entanglement swapping protocol (ESP) is a fundamental primitive for
distributing quantum correlations across distant nodes in a quantum network.
Recent studies have demonstrated that even when the involved qubit pairs are
only partially entangled, it is still possible to concentrate and transmit
entanglement via Bell-basis measurements. In this work, we extend these ideas
to quantum networks with various topologies - including linear, star, and
hybrid configurations - by analyzing the application of the ESP to initially
partially entangled states. We investigate how entanglement evolves under such
protocols by examining the transformations of the initial states and evaluating
the success probabilities for generating maximally entangled states at the
output. Our results offer new insights into the dynamics of the entanglement
distribution in quantum networks and provide practical guidelines for designing
robust quantum communication strategies under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Advancements in photonic platforms have enabled the precise control of
light's spectral and temporal degrees of freedom, a capability crucial for the
development of scalable quantum information systems. In this work, we address
the challenge of implementing spectro-temporal mode-selective non-Gaussian
quantum operations, specifically single-photon subtraction (SPS) and addition
(SPA), in the telecom wavelength regime. Building on prior experimental
demonstrations of mode-selective near-infrared SPS, we present the first design
framework for achieving mode-selective SPA and SPS using thin-film lithium
niobate nonlinear waveguide platforms. We introduce an inverse-design
optimization scheme by modeling the quantum-optical response via the Joint
Spectral Amplitude and Transfer Function, in order to identify optimal
waveguide and pump parameters that maximize mode selectivity and state purity.
This approach is first tested on a metallic waveguide design. We then exploit
the dispersion engineering capabilities of thin-film waveguides, which offer
enhanced nonlinear interactions through tighter light confinement. Our findings
demonstrate that tailored nonlinear processes, particularly parametric
down-conversion and frequency up-conversion, can support high-fidelity
non-Gaussian operations essential for next-generation quantum photonic
networks.

Result: 实验观察到因果不等式被违反24个标准差，证明了设备无关的因果顺序不确定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解因果顺序不确定性及其在量子信息处理中的应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding the physical world fundamentally relies on the assumption that
events are temporally ordered, with past events serving as causes for future
ones. However, quantum mechanics permits events to occur in a superposition of
causal orders, providing new types of quantum resources for quantum information
tasks. Previous demonstrations of indefinite causal order have relied on a
process known as quantum switch and depended on specific assumptions about the
devices used in the laboratory. Recently, a theoretical scheme for the
certification of indefinite causal order in the quantum switch has been
obtained solely from the output statistics of the devices, analogous to the
device-independent proofs of nonlocality through violations of the Bell
inequality. Here, we report an experimental verification of the causal
inequality using spacelike-separated entangled photons, where one photon
functions as the control qubit in a quantum switch and the other serves as an
additional observer. Through local measurement statistics, we observe a
violation of the causal inequality by 24 standard deviations. This work
provides evidence for a device-independent certification of indefinite causal
order, relying solely on observed correlations without requiring device
characterization. Our results pave the way toward a complete understanding of
indefinite causal order and its potential applications in quantum information
processing.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了QKD实现攻击分析方法与经典网络安全研究之间的差距，提升了QKD产品的实际安全性。

Abstract: Practical implementations of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) often deviate
from the theoretical protocols, exposing the implementations to various attacks
even when the underlying (ideal) protocol is proven secure. We present new
analysis tools and methodologies for quantum cybersecurity, adapting the
concepts of vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, and exploits from classical
cybersecurity to QKD implementation attacks. We present three additional
concepts, derived from the connection between classical and quantum
cybersecurity: "Quantum Fuzzing", which is the first tool for black-box
vulnerability research on QKD implementations; "Reversed-Space Attacks", which
are a generic exploit method using the attack surface of imperfect receivers;
and a concrete quantum-mechanical definition of "Quantum Side-Channel Attacks",
meaningfully distinguishing them from other types of attacks. Using our tools,
we analyze multiple existing QKD attacks and show that the "Bright
Illumination" attack could have been fully constructed even with minimal
knowledge of the device implementation. This work begins to bridge the gap
between current analysis methods for experimental attacks on QKD
implementations and the decades-long research in the field of classical
cybersecurity, improving the practical security of QKD products and enhancing
their usefulness in real-world systems.

Abstract: We present a probabilistic quantum algorithm for preparing mixed states
which, in expectation, are proportional to the solutions of Lyapunov equations
-- linear matrix equations ubiquitous in the analysis of classical and quantum
dynamical systems. Building on previous results by Zhang et al.,
arXiv:2304.04526, at each step the algorithm either returns the current state,
applies a trace non-increasing completely positive map, or restarts depending
on the outcomes of a biased coin flip and an ancilla measurement. We introduce
a deterministic stopping rule which leads to an efficient algorithm with a
bounded expected number of calls to a block-encoding and a state preparation
circuit representing the two input matrices of the Lyapunov equations. We also
consider approximating the normalized inverse of a positive definite matrix $A$
with condition number $\kappa$ up to trace distance error $\epsilon$. For this
special case the algorithm requires, in expectation, at most $\lceil
\kappa\ln(1/\epsilon) \rceil+1$ calls to a block-encoding of $\sqrt{A/\|A\|}$.
This matches the optimal query complexity in $\kappa$ and $\epsilon$ of the
related, but distinct, quantum linear system solvers. In its most general form,
the algorithm generates mixed states which approximate matrix-valued weighted
sums and integrals.

Abstract: We systematically investigate the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium quench
dynamics of three-dimensional disordered quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensates.
Within the Bogoliubov-Huang-Meng approximation, we show that the combined
effect of quenched interactions, disorder and excitations may modify the static

developed approach is accurately established. By quenching the interaction
strength, we reveal that the quantum depletion and the deformation condensate
induced by disorder are enhanced in the asymptotic steady state compared to the
corresponding equilibrium values. The time evolution of the condensate
deformation is accompanied by damped oscillations with amplitudes strongly
depend on the disorder correlation length and on the relative quadrupolar
interaction.

Abstract: Cortical activity in-vivo displays relaxational time scales much longer than
the membrane time constant of the neurons or the deactivation time of
ionotropic synaptic conductances. The mechanisms responsible for such slow
dynamics are not understood. Here, we show that slow dynamics naturally and
robustly emerges in dynamically-balanced networks of spiking neurons. This
requires only partial symmetry in the synaptic connectivity, a feature of local
cortical networks observed in experiments. The symmetry generates an effective,
excitatory self-coupling of the neurons that leads to long-lived fluctuations
in the network activity, without destroying the dynamical balance. When the
excitatory self-coupling is suitably strong, the same mechanism leads to
multiple equilibrium states of the network dynamics. Our results reveal a novel
dynamical regime of the collective activity in spiking networks, where the
memory of the initial state persists for very long times and ergodicity is
broken.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localization transition and quantum
criticality {in the ground state of the} disordered Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper
(AAH) model, where a quasiperiodic potential is hybridized with a disordered
potential. In the clean limit, the AAH model undergoes a localization
transition from an extended phase to a localized phase via an intermediate
critical phase as the strength of the quasiperiodic potential is varied. While
the staggered potential merely shifts the critical point to a lower value,
Fibonacci and Thue-Morse potentials induce immediate localization. This
contrast reveals the sensitivity of localization behavior to the structural
complexity of the potential, with the onset of localization correlating with
the sequence's complexity. More specifically, the system follows a hierarchy
defined by the complexity measures of the applied potentials. In addition, the
typical fidelity susceptibility exhibits a power-law scaling behavior at the
localization transition, enabling reliable extraction of the critical exponent.
We focus on the AAH model with the Fibonacci potential due to its minimal
finite-size effects compared to other cases. For the disordered AAH model with
the Fibonacci potential, we determine critical exponents that differ from those
of the AAH model without disorder and the Anderson model. Moreover, despite
differences in localization behavior, we find that the disordered AAH models
with the staggered potential and the Fibonacci potential share the same
correlation-length critical exponent. These findings provide a unified
framework for understanding localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems
and are amenable to experimental validation using emerging techniques.

Conclusion: 超流稳定性是阻碍相互作用BEC产生几何挤压态的关键因素，动态方法为高效挤压提供了新途径。

Abstract: When the rotating frequency of a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) confined in a weak anisotropic harmonic potential is suddenly quenched to
its trapping frequency, the condensate evolves from its ground state to a
single-mode squeezed state with exponentially growing quantum fluctuation
anisotropy. Such a squeezed state is called the geometrically squeezed state.
However, for interacting BECs with two-body collisions, a similar quench only
results in quantum fluctuations oscillating periodically without squeezing. In
this work, we identify superfluid stability as the key factor behind this
non-squeezing phenomenon, with the periodic oscillations arising from
collective excitations of a stable collective excitation mode. By strategically
breaking the stability criteria, we propose a dynamical approach for generating
squeezing that can exponentially suppress quantum fluctuations in a relatively
short time, surpassing the efficiency of existing experimental preparation
schemes.

Abstract: Multi-mode squeezing and entanglement are important resources in quantum
metrology and sensing. For spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensates subject to
spin-orbit coupling (SOC), previous studies on spin squeezing have been limited
to two-mode systems. In this work, we demonstrate that such a system can
naturally construct a four-mode model spanning an $\mathfrak{su}(4)$ algebra
with six SU(2) subspaces. Using spin squeezing parameters and quantum Fisher
information matrices, we analyze the dynamical evolution of coherent spin
states. The results show that, beyond two-mode models, the SOC-induced
four-mode couplings give rise to richer entanglement-enhanced sensing
approaching the Heisenberg limit across various SU(2) subspaces. Additionally,
by tuning a single system parameter (the Raman Rabi frequency), one can
selectively control the optimal measurement directions across different
subspaces.

Abstract: We show that two-component Bose-Einstein condensed mixtures, in presence of a
persistent current, exhibit a non trivial Doppler shift of the sound
velocities. The peculiarity is due to the inter-species interaction and the
possibility of generating a counter-flow persistent current. Analytic
predictions are derived by using superfluid hydrodynamics. While the existence
of anomalous Doppler shifts at finite temperature has been discussed a long
time ago in the case of superfluid Helium-4, an experimental verification of
the effect is still missing. For this reason, we also propose a protocol for
the measurement of the Doppler shifts, based on the density-density response
function. The dynamical protocol is simulated by means of coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations.

Abstract: Topological phases of matter are known to be unstable against strong onsite
disorder in one dimension. In this work, however, we propose that in the case
of a topological ladder, an onsite quasiperiodic disorder under proper
conditions, first destroys the initial topological phase and subsequently,
induces another topological phase through a gap-closing point. Remarkably, by
allowing a staggered flux piercing through the plaquettes of the ladder, the
gapless point bifurcates into two gapless critical lines, resulting in a
trivial gapped phase sandwiched between the two topological phases. This
results in a scenario where the system first undergoes a transition from one
topological phase to a trivial phase and then to the other topological phase as
a function of the quasiperiodic disorder strength. Such disorder induced
re-entrant topological phase transition reveals a phenomenon of direction
reversal in the topological transport, which we identify through Thouless
charge pumping.

Abstract: As engineering advances toward the nanoscale, understanding design principles
for molecular motors becomes increasingly valuable. Many molecular motors
consist of coupled components transducing one free-energy source into another.
Here, we study the performance of coupled rotary molecular motors with
different rotational symmetries under constant and scaling driving forces.
Under constant driving and strong coupling, symmetry match between the motors
decreases the output power. In contrast, under a scaling driving force, the
output power is not sensitive to symmetries. However, driving the upstream
motor too strongly reduces the downstream motor's output power, leading to a
perhaps counterintuitive phenomenon we term disruption, in which the two motors
become disconnected. Across both driving schemes, output power peaks at
intermediate coupling, confirming the value of flexible coupling. Beyond
providing insights into biological motors, these findings could inform the
future design of synthetic nanomotors and structure-based drugs.

Abstract: In this thesis, we develop analytical methods to study out-of-equilibrium
stochastic processes driven by colored noise, i.e., noise with temporal
correlations. These non-Markovian processes pose significant analytical
challenges compared to processes driven by white noise, such as Brownian
motion. A primary focus is on active particle systems, specifically the
run-and-tumble particle subjected to an arbitrary force. We derive exact
expressions for its mean first-passage time (MFPT) and exit probability from an
interval using the backward Fokker-Planck equation. Remarkably, we find that
the MFPT can be optimized as a function of the tumbling rate. Additionally, we
investigate stochastic resetting and switching diffusion models. For switching
diffusion models which are examples of "Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusions",
we use a renewal approach and large deviation theory to derive exact results
for various observables. These include the distribution of the position of the
particle and its moments, but also its cumulants which are key observables to
characterize non-Gaussian fluctuations. Notably, we uncover an unexpected
connection between this model and free cumulants. We also examine these models
in the presence of a harmonic potential by using Kesten variables. This
approach enables us to write an integral equation for the steady-state
distribution, which we solve in specific cases. Furthermore, we extend Siegmund
duality - a concept that is not widely known in the physics literature - to
active particles, random diffusion models, stochastic resetting, and
continuous-time random walks. This duality establishes a direct relation
between first passage observables and the spatial properties of a dual process,
which we explicitly construct.

Abstract: This article proposes a self-consistent methodology for determining the work
involved in an adiabatic process where the dynamics of a Brownian particle is
trapped in an optical tweezers. Instead of varying the frequency of the trap,
it is displaced through a defined protocol. Assuming the dynamics follow a
modified generalized Langevin equation previously proposed by the author, it is
found that the external adiabatic driving is uniquely derived in terms of the
system's dynamical properties, and unlike isothermal processes, does not
require optimization. There is no need to include other parameters than those
characterizing the model.

Abstract: Path-wise observables--functionals of stochastic trajectories--are at the
heart of time-average statistical mechanics and are central to thermodynamic
inequalities such as uncertainty relations, speed limits, and
correlation-bounds. They provide a means of thermodynamic inference in the
typical situation, when not all dissipative degrees of freedom in a system are
experimentally accessible. So far, theories focusing on path-wise observables
have been developing in two major directions, diffusion processes and
Markov-jump dynamics, in a virtually disjoint manner. Moreover, even the
respective results for diffusion and jump dynamics were derived with a
patchwork of different approaches that are predominantly indirect. Stochastic
calculus was recently shown to provide a direct approach to path-wise
observables of diffusion processes, while a corresponding framework for jump
dynamics remained elusive. In our work we develop, in an exact parallelism with
continuous-space diffusion, a complete stochastic calculus for path-wise
observables of Markov-jump processes. We formulate a "Langevin equation" for
jump processes, define general path-wise observables, and establish their
covariation structure, whereby we fully account for transients and
time-inhomogeneous dynamics. We prove the known kinds of thermodynamic
inequalities in their most general form and discus saturation conditions. We
determine the response of path-wise observables to general (incl. thermal)
perturbations and carry out the continuum limit to achieve the complete
unification of diffusion and jump dynamics. Our results open new avenues in the
direction of discrete-state analogs of generative diffusion models and the
learning of stochastic thermodynamics from fluctuating trajectories.

Abstract: Longitudinal magnons are a novel class of multipolar quantum excitations in
magnetic materials with large spins $S\ge 1$ and strong easy-axis anisotropy.
These excitations have angular momentum $S^z = \pm 2S$ and can be viewed as
propagating spin reversals. We study a simple model for longitudinal magnons: a
square lattice of spins $S$ coupled by the neareast-neighbor exchange, ferro-
or antiferromagnetic, in the presence of a single-ion anisotropy. We calculate
the excitation spectra in the large-$D$ limit by using a strong-coupling
expansion. In the specific case of $S=1$ we compare the results for several
analytical approaches that include the linked-cluster expansion, the multiboson
representation of spin operators, and also, for a ferromagnetic ground state,
the exact solution of the two-particle bound states. Among these different
approaches, the multiboson theory gives the decay rate of longitudinal magnons
and describes the evolution of the excitation spectra from strong to moderate
and weak anisotropy.

Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory of the stability of fractional Chern
insulators based on the dipole picture of composite fermions (CFs). We
construct CFs by binding vortices to Bloch electrons and derive a CF
single-particle Hamiltonian that describes a Hofstadter problem in the enlarged
CF Hilbert space, with the well-known trace condition emerging naturally in the
small-$q$ limit. Applied to twisted MoTe$_2$, the calculated CF phase diagram
matches closely with that from exact diagonalization, and the projected
many-body wavefunctions achieve exceptionally high overlaps with the latter.
Our theory provides both a microscopic understanding and a computationally
efficient tool for identifying fractional Chern insulators.

Conclusion: 多带系统的自能分析需考虑矩阵性质，传统单带方法不适用，且不同耦合模型（如Holstein和Peierls）的自能矩阵特性不同。

Abstract: We use a simple one-dimensional two-band model with electron-phonon coupling
to illustrate some of the complications that arise in multi-band systems when
trying to extract a self-energy using the typical approach used for single-band
systems when analyzing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data.
The underlying reason is that in multi-band models the self-energy is a matrix,
not a scalar, and the result obtained from the ARPES analysis is a complicated
function of all these self-energy matrix elements, weighted by different dipole
matrix elements of the relevant Wannier orbitals. We contrast the results for
Holstein and Peierls electron-phonon couplings to further illustrate
differences between models with a local versus non-local self-energy matrix.

Abstract: Similar to transitions in a range of correlated quantum materials, the
valence transition exhibits a strong coupling to the crystal lattice, rendering
it highly sensitive to stress tuning. In the present work, we determine the
effect of uniaxial stress, which breaks the lattice symmetry, on the valence
transition temperature and its crossover temperature in pure and Ag-substituted
YbInCu$_4$. Our key result is that hydrostatic stress is more effective in
tuning this transition than uniaxial stress. Based on a symmetry decomposition
of the stress-induced strains, we argue that this observation can be
quantitatively understood, given that the valence transition is mostly
sensitive to symmetric strains and thus volume changes of the lattice. These
results support the notion that the valence transition can give rise to
critical elasticity close to its critical endpoint.

Abstract: A thorough study of the wide-range (40-35000 cm-1) dynamic conductivity and
permittivity spectra of the archetypal heavy fermion metal CeB6 and
unconventional superconductor ZrB12 was carried out at room temperature. Both
the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations were separated and
analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 was attributed
to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the boron complexes in CeB6 and
ZrB12. It was shown that nonequilibrium electrons participating in the
formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and fraction
of Drude-type electrons does not exceed 37% in CeB6 and 23% in ZrB12. We
discuss also the additional Drude-type component in ZrB12 in terms of
far-infrared conductivity from the sliding charge density wave, and suggest the
localized mode scenario reconciles the strong difference between the number of
conduction electrons obtained from the Hall effect and optical sum rule
analysis in CeB6.

Abstract: Topology and anomalies lead to edge modes that can interact with critical
bulk fluctuations. To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we
consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between
a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott
insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator,
the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger
liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an
emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point.
The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which
electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the
DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued
to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale
auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations.We also carry out calculations
for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary
and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.

Abstract: Twistronics, harnessing interlayer rotation to tailor electronic states in
van der Waals materials, has predominantly focused on small-angle regime. Here,
we unveil the pivotal role of intervalley Umklapp scattering in large-angle
twisted bilayer graphene, which governs low-energy physics and drives
unconventional band topology. By constructing symmetry-constrained effective
$k\cdot p$ models for $\pm 21.8^{\circ}$-twisted bilayers, we demonstrate how
structural chirality imprints distinct electronic responses. The $D_6$
configuration exhibits a gapped spectrum with chiral interlayer coupling, while
$D_3$ symmetric stacking configuration displays semimetallic behavior.
Crucially, chirality inversion creates topological domain-wall states, which
manifest as counterpropagating pseudospin modes at interfaces between
oppositely twisted regions. These states, absent in untwisted bilayers, emerge
from a Jackiw-Rebbi-like mechanism tied to chirality reversal. Atomistic
simulations confirm these topological states and demonstrate their robustness
against symmetry-breaking perturbations. The interplay between twist-induced
chirality and topology opens new pathways for engineering domain-wall states in
twisted materials.

Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem that generic quadratic open fermionic systems,
governed by Lindblad master equations, cannot host dissipation-free topological
edge states. Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors,
we map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes
the band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly
dissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a
topologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s
rigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property. Thus, there is no robust
dissipation-free edge modes protected by the bulk topology in quadratic open
fermions, under any unitary or anti-unitary symmetries. Our result applies to
generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians, requiring only gapped bulk and
bounded spectrum for technical convenience. Our result establish a definitive
boundary for the existence of robust topological phenomena in open fermionic
systems.

Abstract: Arrays of hybrid metal-semiconductor islands offer a new approach to quantum
simulation, with key advantages over arrays of conventional quantum dots.
Because the metallic component of these hybrid islands has a quasi-continuous
level spectrum, each site in an array can be effectively electronically
identical; in contrast, each conventional semiconductor quantum dot has its own
spectral fingerprint. Meanwhile, the semiconductor component retains
gate-tunability of intersite coupling. This combination creates a scalable
platform for simulating correlated ground states driven by Coulomb
interactions. We report the fabrication and characterization of hybrid
metal-semiconductor islands, featuring a submicron metallic component
transparently contacting a gate-confined region of an InAs quantum well with
tunable couplings to macroscopic leads. Tuning to the weak-coupling limit forms
a single-electron transistor with highly-uniform Coulomb peaks, with no
resolvable excitation spectrum in the Coulomb diamonds. Upon increasing the
transmissions toward the ballistic regime we observe an evolution to dynamical
Coulomb blockade.

Abstract: The crystallographic orientation of anisotropic 2D materials plays a crucial
role in their physical properties and device performance. However, standard
orientation techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or X-ray
diffraction (XRD) can be complex and less accessible for routine
characterization. In this study, we investigate the orientation of black
phosphorus (BP) from bulk crystals to thin layers using angle-resolved
polarized Raman spectroscopy (ARPRS) with a single-wavelength (514 nm) Raman
setup. By incorporating thickness-dependent interference effects and
anisotropic optical indices, this approach provides a reliable framework for
orientation determination across different BP thicknesses. The method is
validated through direct orientation measurements using TEM and Electron
Backscattering Diffraction (EBSD), confirming its applicability to both thick
and ultrathin samples. Given its simplicity and compatibility with widely
available Raman setups, this approach offers a practical solution for
characterizing BP orientation without requiring advanced structural
characterization techniques.

The phonondrag term dominates at low temperature in the Seebeck coefficient
This study examines the temperaturedependent screening effect on the
phonondraginduced Seebeck coefficient S^g in a bilayer graphene-
BLG-AlGaAs-quasi-twodimensional electron gas (q2DEG) system at the temperature
below 50 K. The BLG layer interacts with both deformation potential acoustic
phonons and stronger piezoelectric field acoustic phonons from AlGaAs/GaAs. We
compare the electronphonon interactions in BLG with and without screening by
q2DEG. The screening effect reduces particularly at low temperatures and shows
a strong dependence on the carrier density in the BLG layer. The doublelayer
screening function increases with layer separation d paralleling the monolayer
screening at large d. Additionally varying the GaAs quantum well width reveals
that increases with width less than 100 \AA under doublelayer screening but
remains unchanged beyond this threshold while monolayer screening decreases as
the width increases. Both screening functions enhance when the BLG carrier
density is lower than that of q2DEG though the magnitude difference between
them is minimal

Motivation: 探索无序静电势下量子态局域化的机制，弥补传统半经典方法在特定能量区域的不足。

Method: 采用连续薛定谔模型，通过定义包含磁效应的修正景观函数（MLL）来分析局域化特征。

Result: MLL有效势能揭示空间局域区域并预测本征态能量，数值模拟显示低能态局域于势能极小值，高能态则聚集于极大值。

Conclusion: MLL为理解无序量子霍尔系统中的输运和局域化提供了新框架，并将景观理论扩展至磁性系统。

Abstract: We investigate the localization of electronic states in the Integer Quantum
Hall Effect (IQHE) using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By
studying a continuum Schr\"odinger model with disordered electrostatic
potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape
function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state
localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement
regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in
regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical
simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of
the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge
effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between
semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust
framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall
systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.

Abstract: We discuss a theoretical description of the inelastic electron tunneling
spectra (IETS) of a magnetic nanosystem (an atom or a molecule) adsorbed on a
solid surface measured in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). We represent
the nanosystem by means of a cluster Hubbard model, which allows us to study
scenarios when the tunneling electrons sequentially interact with several
magnetic centers inside the nanosystem or when the magnetic centers are made
out of heavy atoms with a strong spin-orbit coupling and large orbital moments.
The sequential tunneling through multiple centers is illustrated on an adatom
probed by an STM tip with a nickelocene molecule attached to it. For atoms with
a large orbital moment, we find the transitions accessible by IETS to be
governed by the selection rule $\Delta J_z\leq 2\ell+1$, where $J_z$ is the
projection of the total angular momentum of the atom to the quantization axis
and $\ell$ is the orbital momentum quantum number of the partially filled
atomic shell carrying the magnetic moment. For atoms with magnetic moments
dominated by spin, the spectra are naturally dominated by transitions
fulfilling the traditional selection rule $\Delta J_z\leq 1$.

Abstract: Due to their chiral structure, carbon nanosprings possess unique properties
that are promising for nanotechnology applications. The structural
transformations of carbon nanosprings in the form of spiral macromolecules
derived from planar coronene and kekulene molecules (graphene helicoids and
spiral nanoribbons) are analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations. While
the tension/compression of such nanosprings has been analyzed in the
literature, this study investigates other modes of deformation, including
bending and twisting. Depending on the geometric characteristics of the carbon
nanosprings, the formation of structural and helix reversal defects is
described. It is found that nanosprings demonstrate a significantly higher
coefficient of axial thermal expansion than many metals and alloys. These
results are useful for designing nanosensors that operate over a wide
temperature range.

Abstract: Topological quantum computing typically relies on topological Andreev bound
states (ABSs) engineered in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices, where
gate control offers key advantages. While strong Zeeman fields can induce such
states, an alternative approach emerges through Andreev molecules -- closely
spaced, coupled ABSs, also key building-block for Kitaev chain -- that enable
topological behavior without high magnetic fields. However, existing Andreev
molecules are controlled via magnetic flux in superconducting loops, limiting
scalability. Here, we introduce a gate-controlled Andreev molecule, where
electrostatic tuning of the density of states in one site nonlocally enhances
the critical current of another. This eliminates superconducting loops,
offering superior tunability, scalability, and sensitivity. We further extend
such an Andreev molecule to a multi-site Kitaev chain, and a noninvasive sensor
resolving single-Cooper-pair charge for parity readout. This platform bridges
the gap between scalable ABS engineering and high-sensitivity quantum sensing,
advancing the development for constructing and parity-readout in topological
ABSs and long Kitaev chains towards topological qubits.

Abstract: Motivated by the rich topology and interesting quasi-band structure of
twisted moire materials subjected to light, we study a non-twisted moire
material under the influence of light. Our work is in part motivated by a
desire to find an easier-to-synthesize platform that can help experimentally
elucidate the interesting physics of moir\'e materials coupled to light.
Similar to twisted moire materials, we uncover rich topology and interesting
band flattening effects, which we summarize in relevant plots such as a
topological phase diagram. Our work demonstrates that much of the interesting
phenomenology of twisted moire materials under the influence of electromagnetic
waves seems to be generically present even in more experimentally accessible
untwisted moire platforms, which remain highly tunable by light.
