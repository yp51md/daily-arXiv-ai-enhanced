In this\ncontext, it is crucial to develop methods and software that minimize the number\nof inter-QPU communications.

However, in\npractice, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations, since\nresolving the singularities of the logarithmic partition function requires\nextremely high precision data especially when distinguishing between weakly\nfirst order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on\nthe finite size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution\nto the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be\nextracted by eliminating the leading volume-law term. This is achieved by\ncomputing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have\nderived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine\nthe phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in\nvarious quantum many body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating\nquantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting\nweakly first order phase transitions, such as in $ JQ $ models, which were\ninitially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The\ndiscontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional\nlocal physical quantities.

Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a\nprimary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity\nand the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing\nprotocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations\nby protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity\ndynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities\nare sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses\nrequired for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed\noperation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate\nentanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration\nleveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for\nexternal photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness.

The common wisdom is that each circuit should be transpiled\nusing up-to-date noise calibration data to optimize fidelity. In this work, we\nrevisit the necessity of frequent noise-adaptive transpilation, conducting an\nin-depth empirical study across five IBM 127-qubit quantum computers and 16\ndiverse quantum algorithms. Our findings reveal novel and interesting insights:\n(1) noise-aware transpilation leads to a heavy concentration of workloads on a\nsmall subset of qubits, which increases output error variability; (2) using\nrandom mapping can mitigate this effect while maintaining comparable average\nfidelity; and (3) circuits compiled once with calibration data can be reliably\nreused across multiple calibration cycles and time periods without significant\nloss in fidelity.

Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum\ninformation non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes.

Crucially, this parity cannot be\naccessed by any measurement that probes only one Majorana mode. This reflects\nthe non-local nature of the encoding and its inherent protection against noise.\nA promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain, implemented\nin quantum dots coupled via superconductors. Even a minimal chain of two dots\ncan host a pair of Majorana modes and store quantum information in their joint\nparity.

Our\nanalysis relies on the scattering approach to quantum transport and applies to\nany multi-terminal setup with arbitrary chemical potential and temperature\ngradients, provided the transmission coefficients between reservoirs are\nsymmetric. This condition is satisfied for any two-terminal system and, more\ngenerally, when the dynamics of particles within the conductor are symmetric\nunder time-reversal.

Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically\nrequire deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and\nimperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum\ncircuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for\nquantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising\npath forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational\nansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli\npropagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that\nimplement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and\nbeyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to\n$30 \\times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard\nTrotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To\nexperimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on\nQuantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's\ndynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without\noptimization.

By pre-sampling tens of millions of bitstrings, either from a\nnoiseless simulator or from IBM hardware, we build large pools of independent\nbut internally quantum-correlated latents.
