The model of non-local conductivity is developed on the basis of the\nKubo technique applied to the Dirac equation for pseudospins. As a result, the\neffective boundary conditions for the electromagnetic (EM) field on a CNT\nsurface are formulated. The dispersion relation for the eigenmodes of an\ninfinitely long CNT is obtained and analyzed. It is shown that due to\nnonlocality, a new type of eigenmodes are created that disappear in the local\nconductivity limit. These eigenmodes should be properly accounted for in the\ncorrect formulation of the CNT end conditions for the surface current, which\nare manifested in the EM-field scattering problem. Additional boundary\nconditions that consider nonlocality effects are also formulated based on the\nexact solution obtained for the surface current by means of using the\nWiener-Hopf (WH) technique for a semi-infinite CNT. The scattering pattern of\nthe EM-field is simulated by a finite-length model of a CNT, using a\nnumerically solved integral equation for the surface current density and its\napproximate analytical solution. Thus, the scattering field of a CNT prevailing\nin the wide frequency range from THz to infrared light is analytically solved\nand analyzed.

It leverages the\nquantum Zeno effect as a reshaping tool to localize the system's dynamics and\nthen applies quantum process tomography to learn the coefficients of a local\nsubset of the Hamiltonian acting on selected qubits.

However, due to the\nunavoidable dark counts in single-photon detectors (SPDs), it has long been\nconstrained by the rapid increase of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) induced\nby empty signals at the receiver, which prevents it from extending to\narbitrarily long distances. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an\nempty-signal detection (ESD) strategy for quantum communication receivers,\nwhich integrates state preparation, controlled gates, and multi-copy analysis\ninto a single block. The core idea is to encode photon-existence information\nonto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) that is independent of the\nmessage-encoding DOF, allowing the receiver, through controlled gates on the\nauxiliary DOFs and subsequent measurements on the auxiliary copies, to verify\nthe non-emptiness of the received signal without disturbing the transmitted\nmessage. In this way, empty signals can be excluded from further communication\nprocessing, thereby resolving the QBER explosion problem caused by empty\nsignals. Moreover, the proposed design relies solely on practical, even\ncommercially available, devices, and can be realized under current\ntechnological conditions. Therefore, this study provides a framework for\nachieving arbitrarily long-distance quantum communication by allowing a lossy\nchannel to be asymptotically regarded as lossless in QBER estimations, and\noffers a proof-of-principle demonstration that secure quantum communications\ncan be extended to arbitrary distances under current technology."}

Such signal analysis benefits from statistical models of signal\nand sensor behavior. This creates a need for data analysis methods that are\nsimultaneously model-based, computationally efficient and causal, in the sense\nthat they employ only sensor data available prior to a specific point in time.\nIn this work, we implement sequential data analysis techniques on a\nspin-noise-based quantum sensor, to perform two key tasks: hypothesis testing\nand quickest change-point detection. These online protocols allow us to detect\nweak magnetic fields by adaptively collecting measurement data until a\npredefined confidence threshold is reached. We demonstrate these methods in a\nrealistic experimental setting and derive performance bounds for the achievable\nprecision and response time. Our approach has potential utility when detecting\nsmall perturbations to the magnetic field, in both applied and fundamental\ncontexts including biomagnetism, geophysical surveys, detection of concealed\nmaterials, searches for dark matter candidates and exotic spin interactions.\nOur results demonstrate that sequential techniques enable faster and more\nsensitive detection, making them a powerful tool for quantum sensing."}

The QGAA consists of\ntwo components: (a) Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) to compress quantum states, and\n(b) Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to learn the latent space of\nthe trained QAE. This approach imparts the QAE with generative capabilities.\nThe utility of QGAA is demonstrated in two representative scenarios: (a)\ngeneration of pure entangled states, and (b) generation of parameterized\nmolecular ground states for H$_2$ and LiH. The average errors in the energies\nestimated by the trained QGAA are 0.02 Ha for H$_2$ and 0.06 Ha for LiH in\nsimulations upto 6 qubits.

The model of non-local conductivity is developed on the basis of the\nKubo technique applied to the Dirac equation for pseudospins. As a result, the\neffective boundary conditions for the electromagnetic (EM) field on a CNT\nsurface are formulated. The dispersion relation for the eigenmodes of an\ninfinitely long CNT is obtained and analyzed. It is shown that due to\nnonlocality, a new type of eigenmodes are created that disappear in the local\nconductivity limit. These eigenmodes should be properly accounted for in the\ncorrect formulation of the CNT end conditions for the surface current, which\nare manifested in the EM-field scattering problem. Additional boundary\nconditions that consider nonlocality effects are also formulated based on the\nexact solution obtained for the surface current by means of using the\nWiener-Hopf (WH) technique for a semi-infinite CNT. The scattering pattern of\nthe EM-field is simulated by a finite-length model of a CNT, using a\nnumerically solved integral equation for the surface current density and its\napproximate analytical solution. Thus, the scattering field of a CNT prevailing\nin the wide frequency range from THz to infrared light is analytically solved\nand analyzed. The newly obtained results are then utilized for determining the\noptical forces exerted on a CNT of finite length. Potential applications for\nthe design of nanoantennas and other electronic devices, including pointing out\nsome future directions, are also discussed."}

In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by\nexperimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor\nfrequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal\nan electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the\nspin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of\nthe spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to\npinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that\nunfreeze as the temperature increases.

The strength of the hybridization is driven by the Van Hove\nsingularity in the JDOS at the band gap: the stronger the singularity, the more\na photon is hybridized with the interband transitions. In order to increase the\nsingularity and thus the polariton hybridization without absorption, we propose\nto engineer a non-parabolic momentum dispersion of the bands around the gap in\norder to implement a high-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) in the JDOS.\nUltracold atoms in tunable optical lattices are an ideal platform to engineer\ntwo-dimensional gapped phases with non-trivial band dispersions at the gap.\nMoreover, the intrinsic non-interacting nature of polarized fermionic atoms\nprevents the emergence of sub-gap excitations, which are common in solid-state\nsystems and could otherwise spoil the absence of absorption below the gap.
