### [1] [Comment on "Unifying Aspects of Generalized Calculus"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06596)
*Mikołaj Sienicki,Krzysztof Sienicki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Czachor的非牛顿微积分通过双射构建，但在物理应用中存在严重问题，尤其是使用病态双射时，结果缺乏预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Czachor的非牛顿微积分在物理应用中的局限性，揭示其核心假设的缺陷。

Method: 分析该理论在相对论、熵和宇宙学等领域的应用，重点关注病态双射（如康托函数）的影响。

Result: 理论在物理应用中常退化为无预测力的重言式，核心假设被破坏。

Conclusion: 该形式主义未能提供物理上一致的理论，适用范围有限。

Abstract: Czachor's recent proposal introduces a form of non-Newtonian calculus built
by pulling back arithmetic operations through arbitrary bijections between
continua. Although the idea is mathematically inventive, it runs into serious
conceptual trouble when examined from a physical standpoint. Claims of
universal applicability quickly unravel under scrutiny -- especially when
considering pathological bijections like the Cantor function, which break the
framework's core assumptions. When applied to domains such as relativity,
entropy, or cosmology, the results often collapse into tautological
restatements lacking real predictive power. This commentary explores these
issues in depth, highlighting where and why the formalism falls short of
providing a physically coherent theory.

### [2] [Matrix Inversion by Quantum Walk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06611)
*Alastair Kay,Christino Tamon*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文简化了量子计算中的HHL矩阵求逆算法，用连续时间量子行走替代复杂的相位估计步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HHL算法在量子计算中具有重要意义，但其复杂的相位估计、振幅放大和哈密顿模拟步骤限制了实际应用。本文旨在简化这一算法。

Method: 通过使用连续时间量子行走替代相位估计，并利用弱耦合技术从微扰理论中提取矩阵求逆。

Result: 成功简化了HHL算法，减少了实现复杂度。

Conclusion: 简化后的算法更具实用性，为量子计算中的矩阵求逆提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The HHL algorithm for matrix inversion is a landmark algorithm in quantum
computation. Its ability to produce a state $|x\rangle$ that is the solution of
$Ax=b$, given the input state $|b\rangle$, is envisaged to have diverse
applications. In this paper, we substantially simplify the algorithm,
originally formed of a complex sequence of phase estimations, amplitude
amplifications and Hamiltonian simulations, by replacing the phase estimations
with a continuous time quantum walk. The key technique is the use of weak
couplings to access the matrix inversion embedded in perturbation theory.

### [3] [Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06612)
*Giovanni Cemin,Markus Schmitt,Marin Bukov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了信息在量子多体系统主动反馈控制中的作用，通过强化学习训练代理，利用部分状态信息防止纠缠扩散，并发现非贪婪、随机的策略能有效降低纠缠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用主动反馈打破细致平衡，实现平衡态下无法达到的稳态和动力学相。

Method: 使用强化学习训练代理，基于部分状态信息控制(1+1)维稳定器电路中的128个量子比特。

Result: 在超过临界信息阈值后，代理学习到非贪婪、随机的策略，将体积律纠缠稳态降至面积律。

Conclusion: 强化学习能稳定多体非平衡稳态，并揭示其临界特性，为量子多体系统的经典控制提供基础。

Abstract: We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum
many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed
balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of
matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning
agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in
(1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that,
above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are
non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to
area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks
that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement
distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum
accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of
equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned
behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work
establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven
individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom,
demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and
uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.

### [4] [Nondegenerate Josephson Mixers with Enhanced Bandwidth and Saturation Power for Quantum Signal Amplification and Transduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06636)
*Baleegh Abdo,Dongbing Shao,Shayne Cairns,Jae-woong Nah,Oblesh Jinka,Srikanth Srinivasan,Thomas McConkey,Vincent Arena,Corrado Mancini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 通过优化约瑟夫森环形调制器（JRM）参数和电磁环境设计，提升了非简并约瑟夫森混频器（JM）的带宽和饱和功率，适用于多频量子信号处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统JM因带宽和饱和功率限制无法同时处理多频量子信号的挑战。

Method: 优化JRM电感以抑制高阶混频产物，并设计集总元件耦合模式网络。

Result: 实现了带宽约400 MHz（放大模式）和700 MHz（转换模式），饱和功率显著提升。

Conclusion: 改进后的JM适用于多频量子信号处理，如高保真量子比特读取和远程纠缠生成。

Abstract: Nondegenerate Josephson mixers (JMs), formed by coupling two different
transmission-line resonators to Josephson ring modulators (JRMs), are vital and
versatile devices capable of processing microwave signals at the quantum limit.
Owing to the lossless nondegenerate three-wave mixing process enabled by the
JRM, JMs can perform phase preserving amplification of quantum signals,
generate two-mode squeezed states, and perform noiseless frequency conversion.
However, due to their limited bandwidth and saturation power, such
resonator-based JMs are generally unable to simultaneously process
frequency-multiplexed signals required in large quantum processors. To overcome
this longstanding dual challenge, we redesign the JRM parameters by optimizing
its inductances to suppress higher order mixing products and engineer its
electromagnetic environment by incorporating lumped-element coupled-mode
networks between the JRM and the two distinct ports of the JM. By implementing
these strategies, we measure for JMs realized with four coupled modes per port,
operated in amplification (conversion), bandwidths of about 400 MHz (700 MHz)
with power reflections above 10 dB (below -10 dB) and saturation powers of
about -110 dBm at 15 dB (-91 dBm at -26 dB). Similarly, we demonstrate for a
low external quality factor resonant-mode JM operated in conversion, a maximum
bandwidth of about $670$ MHz with power reflections below -10 dB and a maximum
saturation power of about -86 dBm at -17 dB. Such nondegenerate JMs with
enhanced bandwidths and saturation powers could serve in a variety of
frequency-multiplexed settings ranging from high fidelity qubit readout and
unidirectional routing of quantum signals to generation of remote entanglement
with continuous variables.

### [5] [A disputable assumption behind the empirical equivalence between pilot-wave theory and standard quantum mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06667)
*J. Manero,R. Muciño,E. Okon*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文分析了de Broglie-Bohm导波理论中绝对不确定性和POVM定理的推导，质疑其依赖的假设“信息总是基于构型”，并探讨了放弃这一假设的后果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨导波理论中绝对不确定性和POVM定理的推导是否合理，尤其是其依赖的假设“信息总是基于构型”是否成立。

Method: 通过详细分析导波理论的数学基础和假设，指出其推导中的缺陷，并探讨放弃这些假设的潜在影响。

Result: 发现绝对不确定性和POVM定理的推导依赖于一个可能不成立的假设，放弃这一假设可能动摇导波理论与标准量子力学的一致性。

Conclusion: 导波理论的基础假设存在争议，需进一步研究以验证其合理性或寻找替代方案。

Abstract: The de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory asserts that a complete
characterization of an $N$-particle system is given by its wave function
together with the (at-all-times-defined) positions of the particles, with the
wave function always satisfying the Schr\"odinger equation and the positions
evolving according to the deterministic "guiding equation". A complete
agreement with the predictive apparatus of standard quantum mechanics,
including the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic Born rule, is then
said to emerge from these equations, without having to confer any special
status to measurements or observers. Two key elements behind the proof of this
complete agreement are absolute uncertainty and the POVM theorem. The former
involves an alleged "naturally emerging, irreducible limitation on the
possibility of obtaining knowledge within pilot-wave theory" and the latter
establishes that the outcome distributions of all measurements are described by
POVMs. Here, we argue that the derivations of absolute uncertainty and the POVM
theorem depend upon the questionable assumption that "information is always
configurationally grounded". We explain in detail why the offered rationale
behind such an assumption is deficient and explore the consequences of having
to let go of it.

Conclusion: 该技术为可扩展的光学寻址量子存储器阵列提供了关键基础，推动了模块化光子量子互连的发展。

Abstract: Many quantum networking applications require efficient photonic interfaces to
quantum memories which can be produced at scale and with high yield. Synthetic
diamond offers unique potential for the implementation of this technology as it
hosts color centers which retain coherent optical interfaces and long spin
coherence times in nanophotonic structures. Here, we report a technique
enabling wafer-scale processing of thin-film diamond that combines ion
implantation and membrane liftoff, high-quality overgrowth, targeted color
center implantation, and serial, high-throughput thermocompression bonding with
yields approaching unity. The deterministic deposition of thin diamond
membranes onto semiconductor substrates facilitates consistent integration of
photonic crystal cavities with silicon-vacancy (SiV) quantum memories. We
demonstrate reliable, strong coupling of SiVs to photons with cooperativities
approaching 100. Furthermore, we show that photonic crystal cavities can be
reliably fabricated across several membranes bonded to the same handling chip.
Our platform enables modular fabrication where the photonic layer can be
integrated with functionalized substrates featuring electronic control lines
such as coplanar waveguides for microwave delivery. Finally, we implement
passive optical packaging with sub-decibel insertion loss. Together, these
advances pave the way to the scalable assembly of optically addressable quantum
memory arrays which are a key building block for modular photonic quantum
interconnects.

Abstract: Quantum simulation of different exotic topological phases of quantum matter
on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processor is attracting growing
interest. Here, we develop a one-dimensional 43-qubit superconducting quantum
processor, named as Chuang-tzu, to simulate and characterize emergent
topological states. By engineering diagonal
Aubry-Andr$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$-Harper (AAH) models, we experimentally
demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum. Using Floquet
engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the
commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally
realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor
is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum
system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy
gap's closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the
distinction between edge and bulk states. Our results establish a versatile
hybrid quantum simulation approach to exploring quantum topological systems in
the NISQ era.

### [8] [Reducing quantum resources for observable estimation with window-assisted coherent QPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06677)
*Harriet Apel,Cristian L. Cortes,Jessica Lemieux,Mark Steudtner*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过窗口化技术改进量子相位估计（QPE）的准确性，特别是在分子可观测量计算中，显著降低了资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子相位估计（QPE）即使在完美门和输入状态下也可能失败，原因是有限量子寄存器无法精确捕获无限精度的相位。

Method: 采用经典信号处理中的窗口或锥形状态对相位寄存器进行偏置，改进相干QPE作为子程序的准确性。

Result: 资源估算显示，Toffoli门数量减少了两个数量级，显著降低了分子可观测量计算的资源需求。

Conclusion: 窗口化技术不仅提升了QPE的准确性，还为理解其在复合算法中的误差传播提供了模型。

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) routines are known to fail probabilistically
even with perfect gates and input states. This effect stems from an
incompatibility of finite-sized quantum registers to capture a phase within QPE
with phase angles of infinite precision, and the effect extend even beyond what
would be reasonably expected from rounding. This effect can be partially
mitigated by biasing the phase register with a window, or taper state, from
classical signal processing. This paper focuses on how windowing a coherent QPE
used as a subroutine can improve the accuracy of the overall algorithm.
Specifically we study the quantum task of estimating observables where
window-assisted coherent QPE is used as a subroutine to implement a reflection
about an eigenstate. Quantum resource estimates show over 2-orders-of-magnitude
reduction in Toffoli counts over the previous costed techniques -- also
assisted by the use of improved block encoding techniques -- demonstrating an
encouraging decrease in resources for quantum computation of molecular
observables. Since QPE, as one of only a few quantum building blocks, appears
as a subroutine in many algorithms; this analysis also provides a model for
understanding how window functions propagate to an improved error in composite
algorithms.

Abstract: Characterizing the nature of hydrodynamical transport properties in quantum
dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of
exotic non-equilibrium phases of matter. Experimentally simulating
infinite-temperature transport on large-scale complex quantum systems is of
considerable interest. Here, using a controllable and coherent superconducting
quantum simulator, we experimentally realize the analog quantum circuit, which
can efficiently prepare the Haar-random states, and probe spin transport at
infinite temperature. We observe diffusive spin transport during the unitary
evolution of the ladder-type quantum simulator with ergodic dynamics. Moreover,
we explore the transport properties of the systems subjected to strong disorder
or a tilted potential, revealing signatures of anomalous subdiffusion in
accompany with the breakdown of thermalization. Our work demonstrates a
scalable method of probing infinite-temperature spin transport on analog
quantum simulators, which paves the way to study other intriguing
out-of-equilibrium phenomena from the perspective of transport.

Abstract: Classically, wave interference is a phenomenon that can be explained by
considering only the waves themselves, that is, without the need to consider
the apparatus that monitors or observes them. Thus, in classical theories,
interference can only occur between waves of the same nature. In quantum
theory, the observed results require a description of the system and its
measuring apparatus, which allows us to rethink the explanation of various
natural phenomena. In this paper, we consider the ion-trap platform to study
the interference of waves with different physical natures, specifically the
electromagnetic and mechanical. At first, we drive two lasers onto a
single-trapped ion to produce Jaynes-Cummings and Carrier interactions, where
we verify that, depending on the phase relationship between the coherent state
of the vibrational (mechanical) mode and the Carrier pulse (electromagnetic
wave), the interactions enhance or cancel out population transfer to the
electronic state of the ion, that works out as our measuring apparatus for
those waves. Extending our result to an ion chain, we verify that a precise
modulation of the Carrier Rabi frequency and phase (electromagnetic pulse)
according to the amplitude of the incoming mechanical coherent state in the ion
chain enables creating either constructive or destructive interference with
propagating pulses, in which the electronic state of the driven ion is,
respectively, populated more and faster, or transparent to both pulse waves,
when the information flux behaves as if no external fields are applied.
Finally, this new type of controlled interference between waves of different
natures allows us to propose new hybrid quantum devices, such as transistors or
filters of wave packets, where photonic (phononic) pulses control the passage
of phononic (photonic) waves.

Conclusion: p-adic薛定谔方程及其量子马尔可夫链在极限分布上表现出优于经典模型的特性，为量子算法开发提供了新视角。

Abstract: The continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) are a fundamental tool in the
development of quantum algorithms. Recently, it was shown that discretizations
of p-adic Schr\"odinger equations give rise to continuous-time quantum Markov
chains (CTQMCs); this type of Markov chain includes the CTQWs constructed using
adjacency matrices of graphs as a particular case. In this paper, we study a
large class of p-adic Schr\"odinger equations and the associated CTQMCs by
comparing them with p-adic heat equations and the associated continuous-time
Markov chains (CTMCs). The comparison is done by a mathematical study of the
mentioned equations, which requires, for instance, solving the initial value
problems attached to the mentioned equations, and through numerical
simulations. We conducted multiple simulations, including numerical
approximations of the limiting distribution. Our simulations show that the
limiting distribution of quantum Markov chains is greater than the stationary
probability of their classical counterparts, for a large class of CTQMCs.

Conclusion: 该框架填补了理论控制设计与实验约束间的关键空白，为跨平台的容错量子技术提供了硬件无关的路径。

Abstract: Mitigating noise-induced decoherence is the central challenge in controlling
open quantum systems. While existing robust protocols often require precise
noise models, we introduce a universal framework for noise-agnostic quantum
control that achieves high-fidelity operations without prior environmental
noise characterization. This framework capitalizes on the dynamical
modification of the system-environment coupling through control drives, an
effect rigorously encoded in the dynamical equation. Since the derived noise
sensitivity metric remains independent of the coupling details between the
system and the environment, our protocol demonstrates provable robustness
against arbitrary Markovian noises. Numerical validation through quantum state
transfer and gate operations reveals near-unity fidelity ($>\!99\%$) across
diverse noise regimes, achieving orders-of-magnitude error suppression compared
to target-only approaches. This framework bridges critical gaps between
theoretical control design and experimental constraints, establishing a
hardware-agnostic pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum technologies across
platforms such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and solid-state
qubits.

Result: 误差标度依赖于初始原子态：高度纠缠态下误差可能以N^2增长，而随机分布态下平均误差仅以N增长。

Conclusion: 提出了可能的误差缓解方法，如使用压缩态或调整场与原子的相互作用时间。

Abstract: When an electromagnetic field in a coherent or quasiclassical (e.g.,
squeezed) state is used to simultaneously drive an ensemble of two-level atoms,
the quantum nature of the field will, in general, cause the final state of the
atoms to differ from the one predicted for a totally classical field. This is a
potential source of error in quantum logic gates in which the gate is the
rotation of the atoms by a laser. In this paper, we use second order
perturbation theory to find how this error scales with the number of atoms,
$N$, being driven simultaneously, for an arbitrary rotation angle. The result
depends on the initial atomic state: for some highly entangled states, and a
field in a coherent state, the error may scale as $N^2$, yet we find that the
average over a random distribution of initial states only scales as $N$. We
discuss possible ways to mitigate the error, including the use of squeezed
states, as well as adjusting the interaction time between the field and atoms
to be different from what would be expected from the classical-field treatment.

Abstract: Identifying the precise moment when a quantum channel undergoes a change is a
fundamental problem in quantum information theory. We study how accurately one
can determine the time at which a channel transitions to another. We
investigate the quantum limit of the average success probability in unambiguous
discrimination, in which errors are completely avoided by allowing inconclusive
results with a certain probability. This problem can be viewed as a quantum
process discrimination task, where the process consists of a sequence of
quantum channels; however, obtaining analytical solutions for quantum process
discrimination is generally extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a
method to derive lower and upper bounds on the maximum average success
probability in unambiguous discrimination. In particular, when the channels
before and after the change are unitary, we show that the maximum average
success probability can be analytically expressed in terms of the length of the
channel sequence and the discrimination limits for the two channels.

Abstract: Characterizing correlations in a quantum system on the basis of the results
of the projective measurements can be performed with different means including
the calculation of the classical mutual information. Generally, estimating such
information-entropy-based quantities requires having complete statistics of the
system's states. Here we explore the possibility to reconstruct the classical
mutual information and specific entropy of a quantum system with neural network
approach on the basis of limited number of projective measurements. As a
prominent example we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum Ising model in
transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields which is in demand in both
condensed matter physics and quantum computing. We show that the neural network
approach gives reliable estimates of the classical mutual information even in
the case of paramagnetic wave functions delocalized in the state space. In
addition, the phase diagram of the considered quantum system is reconstructed

Abstract: Magnomechanical cavities offer a new frontier in quantum electrodynamics that
give rise to several significant theoretical and experimental results. In this
paper, we propose a novel theoretical mechanism for achieving a nonreciprocal
macroscopic entanglement between magnons, photons and phonons, based on the use
of an alternative squeezed magnons method. Indeed, in contrast to conventional
approaches, we show how precise control of the amplitude and phase of the
squeezed mode allows to obtain a tunable nonreciprocity of entanglement. The
magnons resulting from the collective motion of the spin in a macroscopic
ferrimagnet become coupled to the microwave photons via magnetic dipole
interaction and to the phonons via magnetostrictive interaction. Moreover, we
establish that the proposed scheme achieves ideal nonreciprocity, which can be
optimized by cavity-magnon coupling and bath temperature control. Finally, by
using the parameters that are experimentally feasible with current
technologies, this work provides new perspectives for hybrid magnon-based
quantum technologies.

Conclusion: 研究首次在超导平台上实现了灵活调控QME，为量子多体非平衡动力学和量子信息应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: In non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME)
emerges as a counterintuitive phenomenon: systems exhibiting greater initial
symmetry breaking restore symmetry faster than those with less. While
theoretical exploration of QME has surged, experimental studies on its
multidimensional modulation remain limited. Here, we report the observation and
control of QME using a superconducting processor featuring a unique fully
connected, tunable-coupling architecture that enables precise modulation from
short- to long-range interactions. This platform allows independent
manipulation of coupling regimes, on-site potentials, and initial states,
elucidating their roles in QME. To quantify symmetry restoration, we employ
entanglement asymmetry (EA) -- the relative entropy between a subsystem reduced
density matrix and its symmetric projection -- as a sensitive probe of symmetry
breaking. In strong short-range coupling regimes, EA crossovers during quenches
from tilted N\'{e}el states confirm the presence of QME. In contrast, in
intermediate coupling regimes, synchronized EA and entanglement entropy
dynamics reveal the suppression of QME. Remarkably, QME reemerges with the
introduction of on-site linear potentials or quenches from tilted ferromagnetic
states, the latter proving robust against on-site disorder. Our study provides
the first demonstration of flexible QME modulation on a superconducting
platform with multiple controllable parameters, shedding light on quantum
many-body non-equilibrium dynamics and opening avenues for quantum information
applications.

Abstract: Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable
laboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range
interacting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate
interactions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay
of photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations.
Control of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms
at play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective
theoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field
is treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly
perturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective
Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of
polarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to
the cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large
intracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime
and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field
seed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical
description by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature
interval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to
strong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework
for the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits,
amongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with
a versatile experimental platform.

Abstract: Non-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in atomically
thin materials provides new degrees of freedom and enhanced quantum information
capacity compared to conventional phase-matched sources. These systems emerged
as promising platforms for quantum computing, communication, and imaging, with
the potential to support higher-order nonlinear processes. However, direct
observation of photon-pair emission from a monolayer has remained
experimentally challenging. In this work, we theoretically modeled SPDC
emission across the full angular space from a monolayer GaSe film and
experimentally validated the model through measurements of both co- and
counter-propagating photon pairs. We demonstrated two-photon quantum
correlations in the telecom C-band from the thinnest SPDC source reported to
date. The spatially symmetric, broadband emission predicted by theory was
confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, we observed high-fidelity Bell states in
the counter-propagating configuration, marking the first realization of
polarization-entangled photon pairs from a monolayer. Our results revealed the
emission characteristics of SPDC in the deeply subwavelength, non-phase-matched
regime, and introduced atomically thin, counterpropagating SPDC as a scalable
and integrable platform for programmable quantum state generation, extendable
via moir\'e superlattice engineering.

Result: 在顶点数达10^4的完全图上验证，算法在最大度约束超过4时表现优异。

Conclusion: 为大规模图优化的混合量子-经典解决方案提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present a novel quantum walk-based approach to solve the Minimum Spanning
Tree (MST) problem under a maximal degree constraint (MDC). By recasting the
classical MST problem as a quantum walk on a graph, where vertices are encoded
as quantum states and edge weights are inverted to define a modified
Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that the quantum evolution naturally selects the
MST by maximizing the cumulative transition probability (and thus the Shannon
entropy) over the spanning tree. Our method, termed Quantum Kruskal with MDC,
significantly reduces the quantum resource requirement to $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$
qubits while retaining a competitive classical computational complexity.
Numerical experiments on fully connected graphs up to $10^4$ vertices confirm
that, particularly for MDC values exceeding $4$, the algorithm delivers MSTs
with optimal or near-optimal total weights. When MDC values are less or equal
to $4$, some instances achieve a suboptimal solution, still outperforming
several established classical algorithms. These results open promising
perspectives for hybrid quantum-classical solutions in large-scale graph
optimization.

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with quantum computing is a critical
challenge, hindered by the severe constraints of Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices, including barren plateaus and limited coherence.
Current approaches often fail due to static quantum-classical partitioning. We
introduce Adaptive Quantum-Classical Fusion (AQCF), the first framework to
bridge this gap through dynamic, quantum-classical co-design. AQCF's core
principle is real-time adaptation: it analyzes input complexity to orchestrate
seamless transitions between classical and quantum processing. The framework
features three key innovations: (1) entropy-driven adaptive circuits that
circumvent barren plateaus; (2) quantum memory banks that unify classical
attention with quantum state-based similarity retrieval; and (3) intelligent
fusion controllers that allocate tasks for optimal performance. This
architecture maintains full compatibility with classical Transformers while
progressively incorporating quantum advantages. Experiments on sentiment
analysis demonstrate that AQCF achieves competitive performance, significantly
improves quantum resource efficiency, and operates successfully within typical
NISQ constraints. By providing a seamless integration pathway, AQCF offers both
immediate practical value on current quantum hardware and a clear evolution
path toward mature Quantum LLMs.

Conclusion: 结果与现有超导和纳米光子平台兼容，为几何控制的非马尔可夫器件提供实用方案。

Abstract: We show that the distance between two qubits coupled to a structured
reservoir acts as a single geometric control that can store, revive, or
suppress Bell nonlocality. In a mirror-terminated guide, quantum correlations
lost to the bath return at discrete recurrence times, turning a product state
into a Bell-violating one without any entangling drive (only local basis
rotations/readout). In the continuum limit, we derive closed-form criteria for
the emergence of nonlocality from backflow, and introduce a Bell-based analogue
of the BLP measure to quantify this effect. We also show how subwavelength
displacements away from a decoherence-free node quadratically reduce the
lifetime of a dark state or bright state, enabling highly sensitive
interferometric detection. All results rely on analytically solvable models and
are compatible with current superconducting and nanophotonic platforms,
offering a practical route to passive, geometry-controlled non-Markovian
devices.

Abstract: The quest for effective quantum feature maps for data encoding presents
significant challenges, particularly due to the flat training landscapes and

address these issues, we propose an evolutionary training-free quantum

focused on trainability, hardware robustness, generalisation ability,
expressivity, complexity, and kernel-target alignment. By ranking circuit
architectures with various proxies, we reduce evaluation costs and incorporate
hardware-aware circuits to enhance robustness against noise. We evaluate our
approach on classification tasks (using quantum support vector machine) across
diverse datasets using both artificial and quantum-generated datasets. Our
approach demonstrates competitive accuracy on both simulators and real quantum
hardware, surpassing state-of-the-art QAS methods in terms of sampling
efficiency and achieving up to a 2x speedup in architecture search runtime.

Abstract: A two-level quantum system evolving under a time-independent Hamiltonian
produces oscillatory measurement probabilities. The estimation of the
associated frequency is a cornerstone problem in quantum metrology, sensing,
calibration and control. In this work, we tackle this task by introducing WES:
a Window Expansion Strategy for low cost adaptive Bayesian experimental design.
WES employs empirical cost-reduction techniques to keep the optimization
overhead low, curb scaling problems, and enable high degrees of parallelism.
Unlike previous heuristics, it offers adjustable classical processing costs
that determine the performance standard. As a benchmark, we analyze the
performance of widely adopted heuristics, comparing them with the fundamental
limits of metrology and a baseline random strategy. Numerical simulations show
that WES delivers the most reliable performance and fastest learning rate,
saturating the Heisenberg limit.

Motivation: 探索QLS算法在解决实际科学计算问题（如地下水流动模拟）中的可行性，并分析其与经典方法的性能差异。

Method: 通过利用离散化算子的稀疏局部结构，显式构建3D异质泊松矩阵的块编码，并分析其与预条件子的结合效果。

Result: 量子算法在三维问题中表现出$O(N^{2/3} \text{ polylog } N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$的运行时，优于经典方法的$O(N \log N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$，但预条件子未改善有效条件数。

Conclusion: QLS算法在科学计算中具有潜力，但有效条件数减少是实现量子优势的关键挑战。

Abstract: Quantum linear system (QLS) algorithms offer the potential to solve
large-scale linear systems exponentially faster than classical methods.
However, applying QLS algorithms to real-world problems remains challenging due
to issues such as state preparation, data loading, and efficient information
extraction. In this work, we study the feasibility of applying QLS algorithms
to solve discretized three-dimensional heterogeneous Poisson equations, with
specific examples relating to groundwater flow through geologic fracture
networks. We explicitly construct a block encoding for the 3D heterogeneous
Poisson matrix by leveraging the sparse local structure of the discretized
operator. While classical solvers benefit from preconditioning, we show that
block encoding the system matrix and preconditioner separately does not improve
the effective condition number that dominates the QLS runtime. This differs
from classical approaches where the preconditioner and the system matrix can
often be implemented independently. Nevertheless, due to the structure of the
problem in three dimensions, the quantum algorithm achieves a runtime of
$O(N^{2/3} \ \text{polylog } N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$, outperforming the best
classical methods (with runtimes of $O(N \log N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$) and
offering exponential memory savings. These results highlight both the promise
and limitations of QLS algorithms for practical scientific computing, and point
to effective condition number reduction as a key barrier in achieving quantum
advantages.

Conclusion: 该方法在局部测量量子计量学中实现了精度与噪声容忍度的稳健权衡，具有高精度和部分噪声抗性等优势。

Abstract: A central challenge in quantum metrology is to identify optimal protocols
under measurement constraints that reflect realistic experimental conditions,
e.g., local measurements in multipartite scenarios. Here, we present a
sufficient criterion for metrological schemes to saturate the quantum
Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) using local measurements, based on stabilizer
formalism. In ideal settings, we show that graph states always admit local
estimation protocols with an optimal estimation precision determined only by
the underlying graph structure. A family of graph states is identified as probe
states that achieve suboptimal precision scaling. In noisy environments, we
construct several subspaces of probe states (mixed in general) that not only
saturate the QCRB with local measurements but also maintain approximately
invariant precision scaling. These subspaces offer multiple metrological
advantages, including high precision, partial noise resilience, and
noise-correcting capability prior to parameter encoding. Under dephasing noise,
they exhibit markedly better performance than Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
states. Our results advance the framework for local-measurement quantum
metrology, achieving a robust trade-off between precision and noise tolerance.

as a fundamental concept for quantum mechanics and has diverse applications in
quantum information science. Bosonic Gaussian states are a class of quantum
states on infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, widely used in quantum optics and
quantum information science. Bosonic Gaussian states are conveniently and
conventionally characterized by their means and covariance matrices. In this
work, we provide the expression of Bargmann invariant tr($\rho _{1}\rho

Abstract: It is known that the existence of memory effect can revive quantum
correlations in open system dynamics. In this regard, the backflow of
information from environment to the system can be identified with Complete
Positive (CP) indivisibility as well as Positive (P) indivisibility criteria.
It is also known that if a quantum system is CP-divisible, it can also have
memory effect which can be witnessed by P-indivisibility. Here, we have
explored the relation of P-divisibility with unitality condition of noise
channels, showing that a unital channel is P-divisible. We have shown how a
system channel and its environment need to be both P-divisible, but cannot be
both P-indivisible, provided the system-environment joint quantum state evolves
unitarily. We have also established our results using three unitaries acting on
different sets of states. In particular, due to backflow of information from
the environment, quantumness of a system can increase, as shown for an example
of the three-qubit W state.

Abstract: Understanding quantum correlations through information-theoretic measures is
fundamental to developments in quantum field theory, quantum information, and
quantum many-body physics. A central feature in a plethora of systems is the
area law, under which information scales with the size of the boundary of the
system, rather than volume. Whilst many systems and regimes exhibiting an area
law have been identified theoretically, experimental verification remains
limited, particularly in continuous systems. We present a methodology for
measuring mutual information in an experimental simulator of non-interacting
quantum fields, and propose using the analogue $(2 + 1)$-dimensional spacetime
offered by thin films of superfluid helium. We provide numerical predictions
incorporating the natural thermal state of the helium sample that exemplify an
area-law scaling of mutual information, and characterise deviations
attributable to the inherent finite system size.

Conclusion: 新方法不仅简化了KS集的证明，还为量子信息处理提供了更高效的资源。

Abstract: Kochen-Specker (KS) sets are fundamental in physics. Every time nature
produces bipartite correlations attaining the nonsignaling limit, or two
parties always win a nonlocal game impossible to always win classically, is
because the parties are measuring a KS set. The simplest quantum system in
which all these phenomena occur is a pair of three-level systems. However, the
simplest KS sets in dimension three known are asymmetrical and require a large
number of bases (the current minimum is 16, set by Peres and Penrose). Here we
present a KS set that is much more symmetrical and easier to prove than any
previous example. It sets a new record for minimum number of bases, 14, and
enables us to refute Conjecture 2 in Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 010201 (2025),
setting a new record for qutrit-qutrit perfect strategies with a minimum number
of inputs: 5-9.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种量子离散变量多输入多输出（DV-MIMO）信道的多样性策略，利用近似克隆在发送端分发信息，并通过纯化在接收端合并噪声和纠缠态。该方法在特定条件下优于简单策略（如最佳信道选择）。


<details>

Motivation: 量子通信在分布式量子计算和传感中至关重要，多样性策略可提高多信道可用时的通信可靠性（输出保真度）。

Method: 提出克隆-纯化策略，利用近似克隆分发信息，通过纯化合并噪声和纠缠态。与最佳信道选择等简单策略对比，分析优势区域。

Result: 数值结果表明，克隆-纯化策略在完全信道状态信息（CSI）下优化克隆不对称性时具有优势，但量子信息分布并非总是有利。

Conclusion: 克隆-纯化策略在特定条件下优于简单方法，但需权衡克隆操作的稀释成本。

Abstract: Quantum communication plays a pivotal role in enabling distributed quantum
computing and sensing. Diversity strategies can be used to increase the
communication reliability (in the sense of output fidelity with respect to the
input quantum state) when multiple communication channels are available. The
current paper proposes a diversity strategy for quantum discrete variable (DV)
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels, utilizing approximate cloning
to distribute information across multiple channels at the transmitter and
purification to merge the noisy and entangled joint state into a single quantum
state at the receiver. The proposed method is compared with simpler strategies,
such as the best-channel selection, to identify the advantage regions over a
quantum channel combining both crosstalk and depolarization, where the
crosstalk is modeled by a controlled-SWAP operator. Our numerical results show
that the cloning-purification strategy offers an advantage, especially in cases
where full channel state information (CSI) can be exploited to optimize the
cloning asymmetry. More importantly, and in contrast to the classic MIMO
diversity, we demonstrate that the distribution of quantum information over all
available channels does not always provide an advantage due to the dilution
cost of the cloning operation.

Motivation: 传统方法难以同时处理静态和动态关联，VQE-PDFT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过量子电路表示多构型波函数，利用密度泛函评估关联能，开发浅层硬件高效电路并集成到QM/MM多尺度架构中。

Result: 在Charge-Transfer数据集上验证了与传统MC-PDFT相当的结果，并在欧洲知更鸟隐花色素蛋白ErCRY4中成功应用。

Conclusion: VQE-PDFT在量子硬件上的成功执行展示了其在生物量子计算中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Accurate calculation of strongly correlated electronic systems requires
proper treatment of both static and dynamic correlations, which remains
challenging for conventional methods. To address this, we present VQE-PDFT, a
quantum-classical hybrid framework that integrates variational quantum
eigensolver with multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT).
This framework strategically employs quantum circuits for multiconfigurational
wavefunction representation while utilizing density functionals for correlation
energy evaluation. The hybrid strategy maintains accurate treatment of static
and dynamic correlations while reducing quantum resource requirements.
Benchmark validation on the Charge-Transfer dataset confirmed that VQE-PDFT
achieves results comparable to conventional MC-PDFT. Building upon this, we
developed shallow-depth hardware-efficient ansatz circuits and integrated them
into a QM/MM multiscale architecture to enable applications in complex
biological systems. This extended framework, when applied to electron transfer
in the European robin cryptochrome protein ErCRY4, yielded transfer rates that
align well with experimental measurements. Importantly, successful execution on
actual quantum hardware demonstrates practical feasibility for biological
quantum computing applications, supported by comprehensive error analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPUs因其张量网络结构在1D系统中保持纠缠面积定律，但因其张量非幺正性，难以直接实现为量子电路。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过构造多项式深度的量子电路实现MPU，深度T = O(N^α)，其中α仅与张量相关，与系统规模N无关。方法适用于非均匀平移变化的MPUs。

Result: 成功实现了一类MPUs的量子电路，包括生成长程纠缠的非平凡幺正算符，并适用于C*-弱Hopf代数构造的幺正算符。

Conclusion: 本文为MPUs的量子电路实现提供了有效方法，扩展了其在量子计算中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a
consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area
law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum
circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In
this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a
polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated
bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of
polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant
$\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size
$N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate
long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries
constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we
also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show
that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \,
\mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$
being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value
of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.

Motivation: 在现实条件下，B0/B1不均匀性和高浓度样品中的偶极场会显著降低极化转移效率，需要有效的控制序列来缓解这些问题。

Method: 结合平均哈密顿理论和数值模拟，分析并设计了一系列脉冲和连续波控制序列，包括偶极场调整和抑制协议。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在实际实验条件下选择和设计PHIP转移序列提供了实用指导，并为高浓度液态NMR样品中的稳健超极化开辟了途径。

Abstract: Para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) achieves efficient
hyperpolarisation of nuclear spins with the transfer of the singlet order of
parahydrogen to target molecules through catalytic hydrogenation reactions and
subsequent coherent control of the spin dynamics. However, in realistic
conditions B0/B1 inhomogeneities lead to significant reduction in the
polarization transfer efficiency. Moreover, in high-concentration samples,
dipolar fields arising from the magnetisation of the sample can degrade
polarisation transfer efficiency significantly. In this work, we present a
theoretical framework and a comprehensive analysis of both pulsed and
continuous-wave (CW) control sequences designed to mitigate the detrimental
effects of dipolar fields, $B_0/B_1$ inhomogeneities, and moderate chemical
shifts. By combining tools from average Hamiltonian theory with detailed
numerical simulations, we introduce and characterise a wide range of transfer
sequences, including dipolar-field adjusted and dipolar-field suppressing
protocols. We identify conditions under which dipolar interactions either
hinder or, perhaps surprisingly, stabilise polarization transfer, depending on
the sequence structure. Our results offer practical guidance for the selection
and design of PHIP transfer sequences under realistic experimental constraints
and open pathways toward robust hyperpolarisation in concentrated liquid-state
NMR samples.

Conclusion: 该算法为量子电路设计提供了新思路，尤其在控制最终量子态概率方面具有潜力。

Abstract: An algorithm is proposed for constructing quasi-random "peaked" quantum
circuits, i.e., circuits whose final qubit state exhibits a high probability
concentration on a specific computational basis state. These circuits consist
of random gates arranged in a brick-wall architecture. While the multiqubit
state in the middle of the circuit can exhibit significant entanglement, the
final state is, with high probability, a predetermined pure bitstring. A
technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the
quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of
the final peaked state. A modified version of the algorithm enables the
construction of double- or multi-peaked quantum circuits. The matrix product
state (MPS) method is evaluated for simulating such circuits; it performs
effectively for shallow peaked circuits but offers no significant advantage for
deeper ones.

Result: 量子相干性和杂交共同抑制净熵转移，形成热力学瓶颈。

Conclusion: 该方法为研究熵动态和设计更稳健、资源高效的量子硬件提供了通用工具。

Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and
entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be
expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only
a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics
of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors
addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited
to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling
between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting
multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and
related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results
show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy
transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a
general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more
robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.

Conclusion: 分级量子码通过代数几何和同调代数的结合，为量子纠错和计算提供了新的工具和理论支持。

Abstract: We introduce graded quantum codes, unifying two classes of quantum
error-correcting codes. The first, quantum weighted algebraic geometry (AG)
codes, derives from rational points on hypersurfaces in weighted projective
spaces over finite fields. This extends classical AG codes by adding weighted
degrees and singularities, enabling self-orthogonal codes via the CSS method
with improved distances using algebraic structures and invariants like weighted
heights.The second class arises from chain complexes of graded vector spaces,
generalizing homological quantum codes to include torsion and multiple
gradings. This produces low-density parity-check codes with parameters based on
homology ranks, including examples from knot invariants and quantum rotors.
  A shared grading leads to a refined Singleton bound: $d \leq \frac{n - k +
2}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, where $\epsilon > 0$ reflects entropy adjustments
from geometric singularities and defects. The bound holds partially for simple
orbifolds and is supported by examples over small fields.
  Applications include post-quantum cryptography, fault-tolerant quantum
computing, and optimization via graded neural networks, linking algebraic
geometry, homological algebra, and quantum information.

Abstract: Non-adiabatic two-qubit gate proposals for trapped-ion systems offer superior
performance and flexibility over adiabatic schemes at the cost of increased
laser control requirements. Existing fast gate schemes are limited by
single-qubit transition errors, which constrain the total number of pulses in
high-fidelity solutions. We introduce an improved gate search scheme that
enables both local and non-local two-qubit gates in chains containing tens of
ions. These protocols use a multi-objective machine design approach that
incorporates dominant sources of error in the design to ensure the solutions
are compatible with existing fast laser controls. We also generalize previous
schemes by allowing for unpaired pulses during the gate evolution. By imposing
symmetries on the pulse sequences, we eliminate susceptibility to laser phase
noise and further simplify the multi-mode control over the state-dependent
motion of the ion crystal. We perform a comprehensive analysis of expected gate
performance in the presence of random and systematic experimental errors to
demonstrate the feasibility of performing microsecond two-qubit gates between
arbitrary ion pairs in current linear ion-trap processors of up to $50$ ions
with fidelities approaching $99.9\%$.

Conclusion: 阐明了非厄米准晶体中局域化、对称性破缺和拓扑的相互作用，为合成量子物质研究铺路。

Abstract: Non-Hermitian extensions of the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model reveal a
rich variety of phase transitions arising from the interplay of
quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity. Despite their theoretical significance,
experimental explorations remain challenging due to complexities in realizing
controlled non-Hermiticity. Here, we present the first experimental realization
of the unitary almost-Mathieu operator (UAMO) which simulates the AAH model by
employing single-photon quantum walks. Through precise control of
quasiperiodicity, we systematically explore the phase diagram displaying a
phase transition between localized and delocalized regimes in the Hermitian
limit. Subsequently, by introducing non-reciprocal hopping, we experimentally
probe the parity-time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition that is characterized
by the emergence of complex quasienergies. Moreover, we identify a novel
spectral transition exclusive to discrete-time settings, where all
quasienergies become purely imaginary. Both transitions are connected to
changes in the spectral winding number, demonstrating their topological
origins. These results clarify the interplay between localization, symmetry
breaking, and topology in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, paving the way for
future exploration of synthetic quantum matter.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂噪声环境下的量子算法设计和评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, efficient quantum circuit simulations incorporating ideal
noise assumptions have relied on tensor network simulators, particularly
leveraging the matrix product density operator (MPDO) framework. However,
experiments on real noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices often
involve complex noise profiles, encompassing uncontrollable elements and
instrument-specific effects such as crosstalk. To address these challenges, we
employ quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to directly capture the
operational characteristics of the experimental setup and integrate them into
numerical simulations using MPDOs. Our QPT-assisted MPDO simulator is then
applied to explore a variational approach for generating noisy entangled
states, comparing the results with standard noise numerical simulations and
demonstrations conducted on the Quafu cloud quantum computation platform.
Additionally, we investigate noisy MaxCut problems, as well as the effects of
crosstalk and noise truncation. Our results provide valuable insights into the
impact of noise on NISQ devices and lay the foundation for enhanced design and
assessment of quantum algorithms in complex noise environments.

Abstract: In this work, we present an experimental deployment of a new design for

Novel to our system is the dynamic obfuscation of the QKD-PQC sequence of
operations, the number of operations, and parameters related to the operations;
coupled to the integration of a GPS-free quantum synchronization protocol
within the QKD process. We compare the performance and overhead of our QKD-PQC
system relative to a standard QKD system with one-time pad encryption,
demonstrating that our design can operate in real time with little additional
overhead caused by the new security features. Since our system can offer
additional defensive strategies against a wide spectrum of practical attacks
that undermine deployed QKD, PQC, and certain combinations of these two
primitives, we suggest that our design represents one of the most secure
communication systems currently available. Given the dynamic nature of its
obfuscation attributes, our new system can also be adapted in the field to
defeat yet-to-be-discovered practical attacks.

Conclusion: 研究为周期性驱动量子系统的NESS提供了普适性理论框架，揭示了高温下的玻尔兹曼行为。

Abstract: Periodic driving is used to steer physical systems to unique stationary
states or nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), producing enhanced properties
inaccessible to non-driven systems. For open quantum systems, characterizing
the NESS is challenging and existing results are generally limited to specific
types of driving and the Born-Markov approximation. Here we go beyond these
limits by studying a generic periodically driven $ N$-level quantum system
interacting with a low-density thermal gas. Exploiting the framework of Floquet
scattering theory, we establish general Floquet thermalization conditions
constraining the nature of the NESS and the transition rates. Moreover, we
examine theoretically the structure of the NESS at high temperatures, and find
out that the NESS complies, rather surprisingly, with the Boltzmann law for any
driving. Numerical calculations illustrate our theoretical elaborations for a
simple toy model.

Abstract: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated decoder for quantum low-density
parity-check (QLDPC) codes that achieves sub-$63$ $\mu$s latency, below the
surface code decoder's real-time threshold demonstrated on Google's Willow
quantum processor. While surface codes have demonstrated below-threshold
performance, the encoding rates approach zero as code distances increase,
posing challenges for scalability. Recently proposed QLDPC codes, such as those
by Panteleev and Kalachev, offer constant-rate encoding and asymptotic goodness
but introduce higher decoding complexity. To address such limitation, this work
presents a parallelized belief propagation decoder leveraging syndrome
information on commodity GPU hardware. Parallelism was exploited to maximize
performance within the limits of target latency, allowing decoding latencies
under $50$ $\mu$s for [[$784$, $24$, $24$]] codes and as low as $23.3$ $\mu$s
for smaller codes, meeting the tight timing constraints of superconducting
qubit cycles. These results show that real-time, scalable decoding of
asymptotically good quantum codes is achievable using widely available
commodity hardware, advancing the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum
computation beyond surface codes.

Conclusion: 减少辅助量子比特数量可以有效降低逻辑错误率，适用于实际噪声模型。

Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes are a vital technology for demonstrating
reliable quantum computation. They require data qubits for encoding quantum
information and ancillary qubits for taking error syndromes necessary for error
correction. The need for a large number of ancillary qubits is an overhead
specific to quantum computing, and it prevents the scaling of quantum computers
to a useful size. In this work, we propose a framework for generating efficient
syndrome measurement circuits with a few ancillary qubits in CSS codes and
provide a method to minimize the total number of physical qubits in general
settings. We demonstrated our proposal by applying it to surface codes, and we
generated syndrome measurement circuits under several constraints of total
qubit count. As a result, we find that balanced data and ancillary qubit counts
achieve the lower logical error rates under a fixed total number of physical
qubits. This result indicates that using fewer ancillary qubits than the number
of stabilizers can be effective for reducing logical error rates in a practical

Result: 算法成功计算了纯态和混合态的核秩和投影范数，提供了数值证据。

Conclusion: 该算法为高阶张量投影范数的计算提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Projective Norms are a class of tensor norms that map on the input and output
spaces. These norms are useful for providing a measure of entanglement.
Calculating the projective norms is an NP-hard problem, which creates
challenges in computing due to the complexity of the exponentially growing
parameter space for higher-order tensors. We develop a novel gradient descent
algorithm to estimate the projective norm of higher-order tensors. The
algorithm guarantees convergence to a minimum nuclear rank decomposition of our
given tensor. We extend our algorithm to symmetric tensors and density
matrices. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by computing the
nuclear rank and the projective norm for both pure and mixed states and provide
numerical evidence for the same.

Abstract: In scenarios where full access to all qubits of a multipartite quantum system
is available and global operations can be implemented, the preparation of
arbitrary entangled states - including multipartite Dicke states - is
theoretically straightforward. However, practical constraints often limit
direct control over all qubits. In this work, we first present an efficient
method for preparing a four-qubit Dicke state, and then demonstrate how a
four-qubit Dicke state can be expanded to a five-qubit Dicke state even when
only a subset of qubits is accessible. We propose a quantum circuit that
achieves this transformation under restricted control, and support our
analytical derivation with numerical simulations. We further carry out a
robustness analysis of our circuit under imperfect gate implementations and
find that it retains high fidelity for experimentally relevant levels of
coherent over-rotation errors, confirming its resilience to realistic noise.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The $\mathbf{A}^2$ term presents a fundamental challenge to realizing the
superradiant phase transition (SPT) in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we
propose a hybrid quantum system enabling SPT regardless of the presence of the
$\mathbf{A}^2$ term. The system consisting of a qubit, a mechanical mode, and
an optical cavity, where the qubit and mechanical mode constitute a quantum
Rabi model, while the mechanical mode and cavity form an optomechanical system.
Crucially, the auxiliary cavity introduces a switchable $\mathbf{A}^2$ term
that effectively counteracts or even fully eliminates the original
$\mathbf{A}^2$ effect. This allows controllable observation of SPT, diagnosed
via the second-order equal-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ of phonons.
Furthermore, the auxiliary cavity exponentially reduces the critical coupling
strength, significantly relaxing experimental requirements. Besides, we show
that phonons in the normal phase are bunching, but coherent in the superradiant
phase. Interestly, higher-order squeezing is found in both phases, with
near-perfect higher-order squeezing achieved at SPT point, establishing it as a
probe for SPT behavior. Our work demonstrates that hybridizing optomechanics
and cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a promising route to accessing SPT
physics in the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term.

Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion has long served as a fundamental limit for the
resolution of classical optical imaging. However, recent advances in quantum
metrology have led to the quantum superresolution technique that can break
Rayleigh's curse and estimate the separation between a pair of incoherent point
sources with nonvanishing precision. For two-dimensional optical systems, the
precision limit of estimating the whole separation, i.e., the distance, between
two point sources remains unknown so far. In this paper, we investigate the
estimation precision of the distance between two incoherent point sources with
arbitrary intensities in a two-dimensional imaging system. Through the
multiparameter quantum estimation theory, we obtain the ultimate estimation
precision of the distance and show that it remains nonzero when the distance
approaches zero, which surpasses the Rayleigh criterion. We further show that
the precision can be enhanced by aligning the two point sources along specific
directions if the point-spread functions of the two sources are not circularly
symmetric, and find the optimial relative azimuth between the two point sources
and the highest estimation precision of the distance. In addition to the
distance estimation, we also consider the quantum estimation of the relative
azimuth between two incoherent point sources. A surprising result is that the
precision limit of the azimuth decays quadratically with the distance, which
suggests that the azimuth cannot be resolved when the two point sources get
sufficiently close to each other and is therefore inaccessible by the quantum
superresolution technique in this case. This reveals a new and fundamental
limitation on the resolvability of two incoherent point sources in
multi-dimensional quantum imaging which cannot be addressed by optimizing the
quantum measurements.

Abstract: Whether winning blackjack or navigating busy streets, achieving desired
outcomes requires agents to execute adaptive strategies, strategies where
actions depend contextually on past events. In complexity science, this
motivates memory as an operational quantifier of complexity: given two
strategies, the more complex one demands the agent to track more about the
past. Here, we show that conclusions about complexity fundamentally depend on
whether agents can process and store quantum information. Thus, while classical
agents might find Strategy A more complex to execute than Strategy B, quantum
agents can reach the opposite conclusion. We derive sufficient conditions for
such contradictory conclusions and illustrate the phenomenon across multiple
scenarios. As a byproduct, our results yield an information-theoretic lower
bound on the minimal memory required by any agent - classical or quantum - to
execute a given strategy.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that a hexagonal grid qubit layout, with only three
couplers per qubit, is sufficient to implement the surface code with
performance comparable to that of a traditional four-coupler layout [McEwen et
al., 2023]. In this work we propose a method for handling broken qubits and
couplers even in hex-grid surface code architectures, using an extension of the
LUCI framework [Debroy et al., 2024]. We show that for isolated broken qubits,
the circuit distance drops by one, while for isolated broken couplers, the
distance drops by one in one or both bases. By providing a viable dropout
strategy, we have removed a critical roadblock to the implementation of
hexagonal qubit grids in hardware for large-scale quantum error correction.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任意次近邻耦合值，并可扩展到更长程耦合方案。

Abstract: Quantum state transfer is investigated beyond the nearest-neighbour coupling
scheme in long spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ linear chains. Exploiting the properties of
the next-nearest neighbour Hamiltonian's dispersion relation, it is shown that
with minimal engineering, i.e., an on-site magnetic field on the two end sites
and only a few symmetrically-modified end inter-site couplings, an average
transfer fidelity above $99\%$ can be achieved. To leading order, the required
time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality
quantum state transfer is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet
centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site
magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the
inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully
designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the
dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values
of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to
longer range coupling schemes.

Conclusion: 该协议为噪声感知解码和容错阈值假设验证提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Characterizing how quantum error correction circuits behave under realistic
hardware noise is essential for testing the premises that enable scalable fault
tolerance. Logical error rates conditioned on syndrome outcomes are needed to
enable noise-aware decoding and validate threshold-relevant assumptions. We
introduce a protocol to directly estimate the logical Pauli channels (and pure
errors) associated with detector regions formed of two or more syndrome
extraction gadgets, conditioned on observing a particular parity in the
syndrome outcomes. The method is SPAM-robust and most suitable for flag-based
syndrome measurement schemes. For classical processing of the experimental data
we implement a Bayesian modelling approach. We validate this new protocol on a
small error-detecting code using Quantinuum H1-1, a trapped-ion device, and
demonstrate that several noise diagnostic tests for fault tolerance improve
significantly when using noise tailoring and mitigation strategies, such as
swapped measurements for leakage protection, and Pauli frame randomization.

TL;DR: TT codes are a new class of qLDPC codes with high fault-tolerant features, including high noise thresholds, single-shot decoding, transversal gates, and efficient implementations of non-Clifford gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop quantum codes that combine resource efficiency with advanced fault-tolerant capabilities beyond traditional qLDPC codes.

Method: Introduce TT codes based on trivariate polynomials, a length-3 chain complex, and numerical searches for optimized parameters.

Result: TT codes achieve high noise thresholds (0.3% for Z errors, 1% for X errors), single-shot decoding, and outperform 3DTC with fewer qubits.

Conclusion: TT codes offer a promising solution for fault-tolerant quantum computing with improved efficiency and functionality.

Abstract: While quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes are a low-overhead means
of quantum information storage, it is valuable for quantum codes to possess
fault-tolerant features beyond this resource efficiency. In this work, we
introduce trivariate tricycle (TT) codes, qLDPC codes that combine several
desirable features: high thresholds under a circuit-level noise model, partial
single-shot decodability for low-time-overhead decoding, a large set of
transversal Clifford gates and automorphisms within and between code blocks,
and (for several sub-constructions) constant-depth implementations of a
(non-Clifford) $CCZ$ gate. TT codes are CSS codes based on a length-3 chain
complex, and are defined from three trivariate polynomials, with the 3D toric
code (3DTC) belonging to this construction. We numerically search for TT codes
and find several candidates with improved parameters relative to the 3DTC,
using up to 48$\times$ fewer data qubits as equivalent 3DTC encodings. We
construct syndrome-extraction circuits for these codes and numerically
demonstrate single-shot decoding in the X error channel in both
phenomenological and circuit-level noise models. Under circuit-level noise, TT
codes have a threshold of $0.3\%$ in the Z error channel and $1\%$ in the X
error channel (with single-shot decoding). All TT codes possess several
transversal $CZ$ gates that can partially address logical qubits between two
code blocks. Additionally, the codes possess a large set of automorphisms that
can perform Clifford gates within a code block. Finally, we establish several
TT code polynomial constructions that allows for a constant-depth
implementation of logical $CCZ$ gates. We find examples of error-correcting and
error-detecting codes using these constructions whose parameters out-perform
those of the 3DTC, using up to $4\times$ fewer data qubits for
equivalent-distance 3DTC encodings.

Abstract: De novo genome assembly is challenging in highly repetitive regions; however,
reference-guided assemblers often suffer from bias. We propose a framework for
pangenome-guided sequence assembly, which can resolve short-read data in
complex regions without bias towards a single reference genome. Our method
frames assembly as a graph traversal optimisation problem, which can be
implemented on quantum computers. The pipeline first annotates pangenome graphs
with estimated copy numbers for each node, then finds a path on the graph that
best explains those copy numbers. On simulated data, our approach significantly
reduces the number of contigs compared to de novo assemblers. While it
introduces a small increase in inaccuracies, such as false joins, our
optimisation-based methods are competitive with current exhaustive search
techniques. They are also designed to scale more efficiently as the problem
size grows and will run effectively on future quantum computers.

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling is a central technique in quantum computing for actively
suppressing decoherence and systematic imperfections through sequences of
single-qubit operations. Conventional sequences typically aim to completely
freeze system dynamics, often resulting in long protocols whose length scales
exponentially with system size. In this work, we introduce a general framework
for constructing time-optimal, selectively-tailored sequences that remove only
specific local interactions. By combining techniques from graph coloring and
classical coding theory, our approach enables compact and hardware-tailored
sequences across diverse qubit platforms, efficiently canceling undesired
Hamiltonian terms while preserving target interactions. This opens up broad
applications in quantum computing and simulation. At the core of our method is
a mapping between dynamical decoupling sequence design and error-detecting
codes, which allows us to leverage powerful coding-theoretic tools to construct
customized sequences. To overcome exponential overheads, we exploit symmetries
in colored interaction hypergraphs, extending graph-coloring strategies to
arbitrary many-body Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework through concrete examples, including compact sequences that suppress
residual ZZ and ZZZ interactions in superconducting qubits and Heisenberg
exchange coupling in spin qubits. We also show how it enables Hamiltonian
engineering by simulating the anisotropic Kitaev honeycomb model using only
isotropic Heisenberg interactions.

Abstract: The data-processing inequality ensures quantum channels reduce state
distinguishability, with contraction coefficients quantifying optimal bounds.
However, these can be overly optimistic and not representative of the usual
behavior. We study how noise contracts distinguishability of `typical' states,
beyond the worst-case. To that end, we introduce and study a family of moments
of contraction for quantum divergences, which interpolate between the
worst-case contraction coefficient of a channel and its average behavior under
a chosen ensemble of input states. We establish general properties of these
moments, relate moments for different divergences, and derive bounds in terms
of channel parameters like the entropy or purity of its Choi state.
  Focusing on the trace distance, we obtain upper and lower bounds on its
average contraction under tensor-product noise channels, and prove that,
depending on the local noise strength, there is a phase transition in the limit
of many channel uses: below a critical error rate the average contraction
remains near unity, whereas above it decays exponentially with system size. We
extend these phase-transition phenomena to random quantum circuits with unital
noise, showing that constant-depth noisy circuits do not shrink the trace
distance on average, even when given highly entangled states as input. In
contrast, even at $\log\log n$ depth, the average trace distance can become
superpolynomially small.
  Finally, we explore moments of contraction for f-divergences and discuss
applications to local differential privacy, demonstrating that noise regimes
ensuring privacy can render outputs essentially indistinguishable on average.
Thus, our results provide a fine-grained framework to quantify typical channel
noise in quantum information and computation and unveil new phenomena in
contraction coefficients, such as phase transitions for average contraction.

Abstract: The simulation of electronic systems is an anticipated application for
quantum-centric computers, i.e. heterogeneous architectures where classical and
quantum processing units operate in concert. An important application is the
computation of radical chain reactions, including those responsible for the
photodegradation of composite materials used in aerospace engineering. Here, we
compute the activation energy and reaction energy for hydrogen abstraction from
2,2-diphenyldipropane, used as a minimal model for a step in a radical chain
reaction. Calculations are performed using a superconducting quantum processor
of the IBM Heron family and classical computing resources. To this end, we
combine a qubit-reduction technique called entanglement forging (EF) with
sample based quantum diagonalization (SQD), a method that projects the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation into a subspace of configurations sampled from a
quantum device. In conventional quantum simulations, a qubit represents a
spin-orbital. In contrast, EF maps a qubit to a spatial orbital, reducing the
required number of qubits by half. We provide a complete derivation and a
detailed description of the combined EF and SQD approach, and we assess its
accuracy across active spaces of varying sizes.

Abstract: Proving threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a
burdensome endeavor with many moving parts that come together in relatively
formulaic but lengthy ways. It is difficult and rare to combine elements from
multiple papers into a single formal threshold proof, due to the use of
different measures of fault-tolerance. In this work, we introduce composable
fault-tolerance, a framework that decouples the probabilistic analysis of the
noise distribution from the combinatorial analysis of circuit correctness, and
enables threshold proofs to compose independently analyzed gadgets easily and
rigorously. Within this framework, we provide a library of standard and
commonly used gadgets such as memory and logic implemented by constant-depth
circuits for quantum low-density parity check codes and distillation. As sample
applications, we explicitly write down a threshold proof for computation with
surface code and re-derive the constant space-overhead fault-tolerant scheme of
Gottesman using gadgets from this library. We expect that future
fault-tolerance proofs may focus on the analysis of novel techniques while
leaving the standard components to the composable fault-tolerance framework,
with the formal proof following the intuitive ``napkin math'' exactly.

Abstract: Auxetic metamaterials are commonly thought to exhibit favorable mechanical
properties, notably high energy absorption. Here we investigate disordered
metamaterials obtained from random beam networks by optimizing simultaneously
auxeticity and the energy absorbed before fracture. By giving different weights
to these optimization targets, we demonstrate that the optimal configurations
are connected along a Pareto front where high auxeticity implies comparatively
low energy absorption and vice versa. We study the mechanical properties of the
resulting metamaterials and characterize the different deformation modes
obtained for distinct optimization targets. The simulation and optimization
results are validated by comparison with the deformation behavior of additively
manufactured samples. Our work provides an illustration of the potentials and
limitations of multi-objective optimization in the design of disordered
mechanical metamaterials

Abstract: This work presents a statistical mechanics characterization of neural
networks, motivated by the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in spin
glasses. A Hopfield-type spin glass model is constructed from a given
feedforward neural network (FNN). Overlaps between simulated replica samples
serve as a characteristic descriptor of the FNN. The connection between the
spin-glass description and commonly studied properties of the FNN -- such as
data fitting, capacity, generalization, and robustness -- has been investigated
and empirically demonstrated. Unlike prior analytical studies that focus on
model ensembles, this method provides a computable descriptor for individual
network instances, which reveals nontrivial structural properties that are not
captured by conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy. Preliminary results
suggests its potential for practical applications such as model inspection,
safety verification, and detection of hidden vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a
fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale
experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium
dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general
extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing
potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed
different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking
and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we
observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional
U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we
demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string
fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering
processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes.
Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon
quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an
extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order
correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly
correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions
between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing
non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying
far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.

Motivation: 探索一维玻色气体在弱到强排斥相互作用下的偶极压缩振荡行为，解决关于高温下碰撞流体动力学区域有效性的长期开放性问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了激发、热力学、关联、动力学和粒子间碰撞之间的复杂联系，对类似系统的异常现象和相变具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Using the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we study the dipole
compression collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped one-dimensional
Bose gas in the crossover from weak to strong repulsive interactions. In the
uniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model,
while the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous
predictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which
yields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating
signal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore,
we find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature
phononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature
increases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value
characteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This
crossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above
which the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains
the absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing
open question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where
integrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal
intricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations,
dynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic,
nuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar
anomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了Ising测度的应用范围，为非平衡系统中的输运现象提供了新的理论框架和实例。

Abstract: A century after Ising introduced the Ising measure to study equilibrium
systems, its relevance has expanded well beyond equilibrium contexts, notably
appearing in non-equilibrium frameworks such as the Katz--Lebowitz--Spohn (KLS)
model. In this work, we investigate a class of generalized asymmetric simple
exclusion processes (ASEP) for which the Ising measure serves as the stationary
state. We show that the average stationary current in these models can display
current reversal and other unconventional behaviors, offering new insights into
transport phenomena in non-equilibrium systems. Moreover, although long-range
interaction rates often give rise to long-range interactions in the potential
function, our model provides a counterexample: even with long-range
interactions in the dynamics, the resulting potential remains short-ranged.
Finally, our framework encompasses several well-known models as special cases,
including ASEP, the KLS model, the facilitated exclusion process, the
cooperative exclusion process, and the assisted exchange model.

Motivation: 探讨时间相关性对Wigner随机矩阵特征值分布的影响，特别是与半圆律的偏离现象。

Method: 通过构建具有时间相关性的Wigner矩阵，分析其特征值分布，并与半圆律及Wigner-Lévy矩阵进行比较。

Result: 发现时间相关性导致特征值分布收敛于变形半圆律，具有更长尾和更高峰，且与金融时间序列的实证结果一致。

Conclusion: 时间相关性显著改变了Wigner矩阵的特征值分布，变形半圆律更适用于描述此类现象，并与MPD进行了对比分析。

Abstract: We study the eigenvalue of the Wigner random matrix, which is created from a
time series with temporal correlation. We observe the deformation of the
semi-circle law which is similar to the eigenvalue distribution of the
Wigner-L\`{e}vy matrix. The distribution has a longer tail and a higher peak
than the semi-circle law. In the absence of correlation, the eigenvalue
distribution of the Wigner random matrix is known as the semi-circle law in the
large $N$ limit. When there is a temporal correlation, the eigenvalue
distribution converges to the deformed semi-circle law which has a longer tail
and a higher peak than the semi-circle law. When we created the Wigner matrix
using financial time series, we test the normal i.i.d. using the Wigner matrix.
We observe the difference from the semi-circle law for FX time series. The
difference from the semi-circle law is explained by the temporal correlation.
Here, we discuss the moments of distribution and convergence to the deformed
semi-circle law with a temporal correlation. We discuss the phase transition
and compare to the Marchenko-Pastur distribution(MPD) case.

Abstract: We experimentally study a gas of $N = 8$ one-dimensional Brownian particles,
each confined in a harmonic trap with identical stiffness. The stiffness
switches simultaneously between two values at random Poissonian times. This
collective switching drives the system into a non-equilibrium stationary state
(NESS) with strong long-range correlations between the positions of the
particles. Remarkably, we find that these switching-induced emergent
correlations completely overwhelm the hydrodynamic interactions between the
particles mediated via the surrounding fluid. Comparing with exact theoretical
predictions for noninteracting particles, we observe excellent agreement
between theory and experiments for multiple observables, including the
correlations between particles, extreme value and order statistics (maxima,
minima and ranked positions) and the full counting statistics (i.e., the
distribution of the number of particles in a finite interval $[-L, L]$ around
the trap center).

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a single inertial probe driven
into a nonequilibrium steady-state by random collisions with self-propelled
active walkers. The probe and walkers are confined within a gravitational
harmonic potential. We evaluate the robustness of the effective temperature
concept in this active system by comparing values of distinct, independently
motivated definitions: a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation, a
kinetic temperature, and a work fluctuation relation. Our experiments reveal
that, under specific conditions, these independent measurements yield a
remarkably consistent effective temperature over a wide range of system
configurations. Furthermore, we also identify regimes where this consistency
breaks down, which delineates the fundamental limits of extending
equilibrium-like thermodynamic concepts to athermal, actively driven systems.

Conclusion: 研究确认了超临界区域的相图，包含气体、超临界流体和液态三个状态，由遵循普遍标度律的两个交叉边界分隔。

Abstract: A supercritical fluid (SCF)--the state of matter at temperatures and
pressures above the critical point--exhibits properties intermediate between
those of a liquid and a gas. However, whether it constitutes a fundamentally
distinct phase or merely a continuous extension of the liquid and gas states
remains an open question. Here we show that a SCF is defined by sub-short-range
(SSR) structural order in the spatial arrangement of particles, setting it
apart from the gas (disordered), liquid (short-range ordered), and solid
(long-range ordered) states. The SSR structural order can be characterized by a
length scale effectively quantified by the number of observable peaks in the
radial distribution function. This length grows from a minimum microscopic
value, on the order of the inter-particle distance at the gas-SCF boundary, to
a diverging value at the SCF-liquid boundary. Based on the emergence of SSR
order, we demonstrate that the transport and dynamical properties of the SCF
state, including the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity
autocorrelation function, also clearly distinguish it from both the liquid and
gas states. Theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics
simulations of argon and further supported by existing experimental evidence.
Our study confirms and assigns physical significance to the refined phase
diagram of matter in the supercritical region, consisting of three distinct
states (gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid) separated by two crossover
boundaries that follow universal scaling laws.

Conclusion: 绝对零度附近可能存在多种热力学系统，传统假设需重新审视。

Abstract: It has long been taken for granted that there is only one type of
thermodynamic system near absolute zero temperature: the ordinary one
compatible with all statements of the third law, with a fundamental yet tacit
assumption that all heat capacities in the system vanish as absolute
temperature approaches zero. However, in the strict sense, the statements are
not mutually equivalent. Once the tacit assumption is released, the
inequivalence must remain, and we may have some systems that are only
compatible with one or two statements but not all, defining a singular
zero-temperature system which can never be excluded from physical feasibility.
We revisit some previously proposed theoretical models and identify that they
belong to the singular system.

Abstract: Time delay can have a significant impact on the properties of collective
organization of active matter. In the previous paper [1], we discussed
delay-induced breathing in a system of swarmalators - a model coupling
particles' internal phases to spatial interactions. Here we build on that study
to investigate the aging phenomenon in this system. It is the aging of a
two-dimensional crystal with defects and inhomogeneous lattice constants, and
takes place after the breathing transients subside. We show that aging proceeds
through the gradual elimination of five-fold and seven-fold coordination number
defects, which merge pairwise or migrate to the cluster boundary, incrementally
increasing the hexatic order parameter in the bulk. Despite this process,
defects usually do not fully disappear; some residual number of defects remain
frozen in the interior. However, we found that it is possible to achieve a
nearly total elimination of coordination number defects at sufficiently low
delay - when the surface of the cluster develops a sufficeintly thick fluidized
``boiling layer''. This mechanism of boundary-mediated annealing reveals a
non-equilibrium pathway to achieving high crystalline order in the bulk, and
raises a tantalizing possibility for controlling defects in active matter with
free boundaries.

Abstract: Ion transport through nanoscale channels and pores is pivotal to numerous
natural processes and industrial applications. Experimental investigation of
the kinetics and mechanisms of such processes is, however, hampered by the
limited spatiotemporal resolution of existing experimental techniques. While
molecular simulations have become indispensable for unraveling the underlying
principles of nanoscale transport, they also suffer from some important
technical limitations. In our previous works, we identified strong
polarization-induced finite-size effects in molecular dynamics simulations of
hindered ion transport, caused by spurious long-range interactions between the
traversing ion and the periodic replicates of other ions. To rectify these
artifacts, we introduced the Ideal Conductor/Dielectric Model (\textsc{Icdm}),
which treats the system as a combination of conductors and dielectrics, and
constructs an analytical correction to the translocation free energy profile.
Here, we investigate some limitations of this model. Firstly, we propose a
generalized approach based on Markov State models that is capable of estimating
translocation timescales in the thermodynamic limit for free energy profiles
with multiple comparable barriers. Second, we identify a new category of
polarization-induced finite-size effects, which significantly alter the spatial
distribution of non-traversing ions in smaller systems. These secondary effects
cannot be corrected by the ICDM model and must be avoided by selecting
sufficiently large system sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate through multiple
case studies that finite-size artifacts can reverse expected trends in ion
transport kinetics. Our findings underscore the necessity for careful selection
of system sizes and the judicious application of the \textsc{Icdm} model to
rectify residual finite-size artifacts.

Result: 发现Sokoban模型属于Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan捕获普适类，生存概率呈现拉伸指数松弛，并识别出新的捕获转变阈值ρ*≈0.55。

Conclusion: Sokoban行走者的动态行为导致渗流转变消失，并引入新的捕获机制，丰富了随机行走理论。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of a $\textit{Sokoban random walker}$ moving in a
disordered medium with obstacle density $\rho$. In contrast to the classic
model of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation
transition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by
pushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing
ability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of
a rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we
demonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the
Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival
probability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits
stretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average
trap size as a proxy, we identify a new trapping transition that replaces the
classical percolation transition. This transition occurs at a threshold density
$\rho_* \approx 0.55$ and separates two qualitatively distinct trapping
regimes: a self-trapping regime at low density, where the walker becomes
dynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping
regime at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement
of obstacles.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data
distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the
state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications such as artificial image
synthesis. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented
based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In
contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the
velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by
imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only.
The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and
leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function
and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data
distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.

Conclusion: LENS为高维时间序列数据提供了一种学习驱动的熵产生率估计方法。

Abstract: Any coarse-grained description of a nonequilibrium system should faithfully
represent its latent irreversible degrees of freedom. However, standard
dimensionality reduction methods typically prioritize accurate reconstruction
over physical relevance. Here, we introduce a model-free approach to identify
irreversible degrees of freedom in stochastic systems that are in a
nonequilibrium steady state. Our method leverages the insight that a black-box
classifier, trained to differentiate between forward and time-reversed
trajectories, implicitly estimates the local entropy production rate. By
parameterizing this classifier as a quadratic form of learned state
representations, we obtain nonlinear embeddings of high-dimensional state-space
dynamics, which we term Latent Embeddings of Nonequilibrium Systems (LENS).
LENS effectively identifies low-dimensional irreversible flows and provides a
scalable, learning-based strategy for estimating entropy production rates

Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries which do not commute with
spatial symmetries; dipolar symmetries are a prime example. We give a general
recipe for constructing topological phases protected by modulated symmetries
via a defect network construction, generalizing the crystalline equivalence
principle to modulated symmetries. We demonstrate that modulated symmetries can
be treated identically to unmodulated symmetries in the absence of spatial
symmetries, but in the presence of spatial symmetries, some defect networks
which are non-anomalous for unmodulated symmetries become anomalous for
modulated symmetries. We apply this understanding to classify
symmetry-protected topological phases protected by translation symmetry plus
either discrete or continuous dipolar symmetries in (1+1)D and (2+1)D and
obtain a number of other (1+1)D classification results for modulated
symmetry-protected topological phases.

Conclusion: 该fracton量子自旋液体不仅在基态中被发现，还在强碎片化希尔伯特空间的低能区中存在。

Abstract: Gapless fracton quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter described by
higher-rank U(1) gauge theories which host gapped and immobile fracton matter
excitations as well as gapless photons. Despite well-known field theories, no
spin models beyond purely classical systems have been identified to realize
these phases. Using error-controlled Green function Monte Carlo, here we
investigate a square lattice spin-1 model that shows precise signatures of a
fracton quantum spin liquid without indications of conventional ordering.
Specifically, the magnetic response exhibits characteristic patterns of
suppressed pinch points that accurately match the prediction of a rank-2 U(1)
field theory and reveals the existence of emergent photon excitations in 2+1
spacetime dimensions. Remarkably, this type of fracton quantum spin liquid is
not only identified in the system's ground state but also in generic low-energy
sectors of a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.

Abstract: Classical U(1) fracton spin liquids feature an extensive ground state
degeneracy and follow an effective description in terms of a tensor Gauss' law
where charges, so-called fractons, have restricted mobility. Here we introduce
a simple spin model that realizes such a state by straightforward
discretization of the higher-rank gauge theory on a square lattice. The
simplicity of this construction offers direct insights into the system's
fundamental fractonic properties, such as real-space fracton configurations,
height-field representation of the classical ground state manifold as well as
properties of local and non-local fluctuations within the fracton-free
subspace. By sampling classical Ising states from the extensive ground state
manifold, we show that the effective tensor Gauss' law remains intact when
explicitly enforcing the spin-1/2 length constraint, demonstrating the
existence of a classical Ising fracton spin liquid. However, we observe that
perturbative quantum effects are insufficient to efficiently tunnel between
classical ground states, leading to severe Hilbert space fragmentation which
obscures fractonic quantum behavior. Specifically, by simulating the spin-1/2
quantum model with Green function Monte Carlo as a function of the
Rokhsar-Kivelson potential, we find that the system supports either magnetic
long-range order or a classical spin liquid. Our findings highlight the crucial
role of Hilbert-space fragmentation in fractonic spin systems but also indicate
ways to mitigate such effects via increasing the spin magnitude to $S=1$,
investigated in a companion paper.

Conclusion: 研究结果支持将三层Hubbard模型简化为有效的双层混合维$t$-$J$模型，为理解镍酸盐中的层间超导提供了统一框架。

Abstract: The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for
exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism
remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix
renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard
model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our
results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals:
while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer
antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows
exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order
in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for
forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and
Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the
trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model,
providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer
and bilayer nickelates.

proposals of FL$^{*}$ and orthogonal Fermi liquids, and present a route to it's
direct instability to novel, competing orders.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of materials that combine antiferromagnetic
spin ordering with non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in their band
structure, making them promising candidates for spintronics applications
without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate a
two-dimensional bilayer Mott insulator that exhibits altermagnetic order. The
interplay between spin and layer degrees of freedom gives rise to a complex
symmetry-breaking pattern involving both magnetic and interlayer-coherent
components. A key control parameter in the system is the layer polarization,
which can be tuned via an external gate voltage. We show that applying an
in-plane electric field with opposite signs in the two layers induces a
polarization current that drives a spin current in each layer. While the
polarization current is isotropic, the resulting spin current exhibits strong
anisotropy and can be reversed by adjusting the photon energy. These findings
suggest new avenues for manipulating spin transport in altermagnetic systems
via electric and optical means.

Abstract: The transverse thermoelectric effect enables simpler, more flexible
thermoelectric devices by generating electricity perpendicular to heat flow,
offering promising solutions for waste heat recovery and solid-state cooling
applications. Here, we report a striking observation of zero-field anomalous
Hall effect (AHE) and anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) below TC in the
two-dimensional metallic magnet FePd2Te2. The anomalous Nernst signal Syx^A
peaks a maximum value of 0.15 {\mu}V/K at 100 K, much larger than that of
conventional FM materials. Remarkably, the derived ratio alpha_ij/sigma_ij in
FePd2Te2 approaches the fundamental limit of 86 {\mu}V/K. Our findings suggest
a dominant Berry curvature contribution to the ANE. The observed giant
zero-field anomalous Nernst response in 2D FePd2Te2 not only advances
fundamental understanding of transverse thermoelectricity in layered magnets,
but also provides this material as a promising candidate for practical

Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of
valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$
and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However,
direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible
valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an
outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full
valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically
introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables
deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in
monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with
a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that
unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely
decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This
all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across
an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to
petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley
polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm
of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the
$\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information
processing.

Abstract: When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it
gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy,
quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their
experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold
atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more
recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy
scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize
and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic
correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional
superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review
presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material
realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the
origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical
lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries.
Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and
theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non
perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band
materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this
review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body
phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.

Abstract: Understanding the nature of collective charge dynamics in the Coulomb gap
phase is essential for revealing the existence of many-body localization.
However, the corresponding many-particle excitation spectra remain poorly
understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of $^{27}$Al and
$^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance (NMR/NQR), along with specific
heat ($C_p$) measurements, in the $p$-type semiconductor CuAlO$_2$. Our study
unveils distinct changes in charge dynamics at two crossover temperature scales
which separate three regimes associated with Anderson localization of charge
carriers: thermally activated transport ($T>150$ K) $\rightarrow$ Mott
variable-range hopping (VRH) $\rightarrow$ Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH with
Coulomb gap formation ($T<50$ K). In the ES VRH regime, we observe a striking
divergence in the zero-field $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate,
$(T_1T)^{-1}$, which is strongly suppressed by an applied magnetic field,
indicative of quantum critical charge fluctuations. This is further supported
by a distinct magnetic field-dependence of $C_p/T$ deep within the Coulomb gap
phase. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the
emergence of strong, gapless collective charge fluctuations within the Anderson
insulating phase where single-particle excitations are gapped.

Conclusion: 某些二分划分能更准确地反映体临界性，为DQCP的性质提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Recent works on the scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5)
deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) sparked a huge controversy. Different
bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is a
unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously
disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality
-- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite
scenarios, and point out what kind of bipartition truly reflects the
criticality of the bulk. We have found that the correspondence between the
entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still persists even at a
bulk-gapless point (e.g. critical point), thereby influencing the behavior of
entanglement entropy.

Abstract: The insulator-bad metal transition observed in the Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets
orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth or yttrium Y) is considered to be a
canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the
framework of the Hubbard $U$-$t$-model and the density functional theory.
However, actually the real insulating phase of nickelates is the result of
charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet
(S=1) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless (S=0) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$
centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons
moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. Taking account of only charge degree of
freedom we develop a novel minimal $U$-$V$-$t_b$-model for nickelates making
use of the charge triplet model with the pseudospin formalism and effective
field approximation. We show the existence of two types of CD-phases,
high-temperature classical CO-phase with the G-type charge ordering of electron
and hole centers, and low-temperature quantum CDq-phase with charge and spin
density transfer between electron and hole centers, uncertain valence and spin
value for NiO$_6$ centers. Model $T$-R phase diagram reproduces main features
of the phase diagram found for RNiO$_3$.

Abstract: We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when
applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the
structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled,
antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show
that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a
structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed
through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a
shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed
magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition.
Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders
of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial
enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a
highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that
the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy,
underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis
as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in
strongly correlated materials.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic ground states, when doped, give rise to rich and complex
phenomena, prompting detailed investigations in various spin systems. Here, we
study the effect of doping on the one-dimensional $S = 1$ antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model (AFM). Specifically, we investigate how the presence of holes
affects the static and dynamic (frequency-dependent) spin-spin correlations of
the two-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori chain. The latter, at half-filling and in the
limit of strong interactions, maps onto an $S = 1$ Heisenberg model. For
moderate interactions, an orbital resonating-valence-bond (orbital-RVB) state
emerges up to doping levels of $x \lesssim 0.4$. A detailed analysis of
interaction strength $U$ and doping concentration $x$ reveals that this phase
inherits the key features of spin excitations found in the half-filled case --
namely, a gapped spin spectrum and ``coherent'' magnon behavior up to a
wavevector $q$ determined by the Fermi vector, $2k_\mathrm{F} = \pi(1 - x)$.
Furthermore, our results uncover an additional broad, incoherent spectral
weight for $q \gtrsim 2k_\mathrm{F}$ at high frequencies. Finally, we show that
near the transition to a ferromagnetic phase, a previously unidentified
spiral-like state emerges, characterized by spin excitations reminiscent of the
$J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals enable the observation of bulk magnetism
in topological quantum phases. We report site-selective NMR spectroscopy that
probes local static and dynamic spin susceptibility on the magnetic semimetal
BaMnBi$_2$. We find that spontaneous staggered fields from antiferromagnetic Mn
moments are completely canceled at the Bi layer hosting Dirac fermions. In an
in-plane field, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ follows the
cubic temperature dependence to low temperatures, manifesting the ideal Dirac
semimetal with chemical potential close to the Dirac point. In an out-of-plane
field, $1/T_1$ becomes a constant below 20 K, where the Laudau level appears,
and is enhanced more than 100 times larger than under the in-plane field. The
result demonstrates a condensation of quantized Dirac fermions in the quantum
Hall regime.

describing a smooth crossover between low- and high- temperature regimes. We
discuss applicability of the generalized Cutler-Mott relations for computing a

Abstract: We present a systematic framework for constructing exactly-solvable lattice
models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases based on an enlarged
version of the string-net model. We also gauge the global symmetries of our SET
models to obtain string-net models of pure topological phases. Without invoking
externally imposed onsite symmetry actions, our approach promotes the
string-net model of a pure topological order, specified by an input unitary
fusion category $\mathscr{F}$, to an SET model, specified by a multifusion
category together with a set of isomorphisms. Two complementary construction
strategies are developed in the main text: (i) promotion via outer
automorphisms of $\mathscr{F}$ and (ii) promotion via the Frobenius algebras of
$\mathscr{F}$. The global symmetries derived via these two strategies are
intrinsic to topological phases and are thus termed blood symmetries, as
opposed to adopted symmetries, which can be arbitrarily imposed on topological
phases. We propose the concept of symmetry-gauging family of topological
phases, which are related by gauging their blood symmetries. With our approach,
we construct the first explicit lattice realization of a
nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase -- the $S_3$ symmetry-enriched
$\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum-double phase. The approach further
reveals the role of local excitations in SET phases and establishes their
symmetry constraints.

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol of low-temperature, strain-tuned re-entrant

Our results on transport signatures exhibit variable scaling exponents for
electrical resistivity and optical conductivity, providing clear evidence of
non-Fermi liquid physics. We also define a strain-dependent thermal scale to
quantify the crossover between the non-Fermi liquid and bad metal phases.

Abstract: Spin liquid and spin glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered
quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by
quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin-freezing, but identifying each state
and characterizing the transition between them remain challenging. Here, we
systematically explore the relationship between the spin liquid and spin glass
states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among $p$ spins, which
interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and
isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size $N$ dependence of
the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the
transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of $p$. We
show that the phase diagrams for different $p$ can be unified through a scaling
with $N/p^2$, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions
systematically suppresses the spin liquid phase and extends the spin glass
regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin
interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic
case, and find that the spin liquid phase transitions into the spin glass phase
before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide new insights
into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.

Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view
and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon
where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be
effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime.
Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement
compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the
family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and
T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic
and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the
emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific
materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined
approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can
be used for other materials families to build a materials database for
radiative heat transfer.

Abstract: Inversion-asymmetric antiferromagnets (AFMs) with odd-parity
spin-polarization pattern have been proposed as a new venue for spintronics.
These AFMs require commensurate ordering to ensure an effective time-reversal
symmetry, which guarantees a strictly antisymmetric spin polarization of the
electronic states. Recently, nonsymmorphic centrosymmetric crystals have been
identified as a broad class of materials which could exhibit unit-cell doubling
magnetism with odd-parity spin-polarization. Here we investigate the stability
of these states against incommensuration. We first demonstrate that the
symmetry conditions which permit a p-wave spin polarization pattern also permit
the existence of a non-relativistic Lifshitz invariant in the phenomenological
Ginzburg-Landau free energy. This implies magnetism with an incommensurate
ordering vector, independent of its microscopic origin. AFMs with f- or h-wave
spin-polarization are also prone to incommensurability, especially when they
have an itinerant origin. Here the symmetry which ensures the odd-parity
spin-polarization also guarantees the existence of van Hove saddle points off
the time-reversal-invariant momenta, which promote incommensurate spin
fluctuations in quasi-two-dimensional electronic systems. Finally, we study the
effect of weak spin-orbit coupling in locally noncentrosymmetric materials and
find that it favors antiferromagnetic phases with in-plane magnetic moments.
However, the inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling also introduces a new
mechanism for driving incommensuration. Our results imply that odd-parity AFMs
are likely to be preceded by an incommensurate phase, or emerge directly from
the normal state via a first order transition. These conclusions are consistent
with the phase diagram of several candidate materials.

Abstract: Due to the structure of the underlying SO(3) $\mathbf d$-vector order
parameter, spin triplet superconductors exhibit a bulk-edge correspondence
linking the circulation of supercurrent to the bulk magnetic skyrmion density,
giving rise to topological hydrodynamics of magnetic skyrmions. To probe the
interplay of charge and spin dynamics, we propose a blueprint for a
spin-triplet superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which
functions without a Josephson weak link. The triplet SQUID undergoes
nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by
spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling
the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response
via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of
ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.

Abstract: Non-Abelian topological phases, which go beyond traditional Abelian
topological band theory, are garnering increasing attention. This is further
spurred by periodic driving, leading to predictions of many novel multi-gap
Floquet topological phases, including anomalous Euler and Dirac string phases
induced by non-Abelian Floquet braiding, as well as Floquet non-Abelian
topological insulators (FNTIs) that exhibit multifold bulk-edge correspondence.
Here, we report the first experimental realization of anomalous FNTIs, which
demonstrate topological edge modes in all three gaps despite having a trivial
bulk charge. Concretely, we construct an experimentally feasible
one-dimensional three-band Floquet model and implement it in acoustics by
integrating time-periodic coupling circuits to static acoustic crystals.
Furthermore, we observe counterintuitive topological interface modes in the
domain-wall formed by an anomalous FNTI and its counterpart with swapped
driving sequences, modes previously inaccessible in Floquet Abelian systems.
Our work paves the way for further experimental exploration of the uncharted
non-equilibrium topological physics.

Conclusion: 扭曲双层石墨烯在魔角附近的无序性导致电子态的特殊行为，填充整数时的化学势跳跃是级联跃迁的根源。

Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is known to have disorder in its twist angle.
We show that in terms of a Dirac equation with a random gauge potential ${\bf
A}({\bf r})$ this disorder becomes huge when the average twist angle is near
the magic angle where the Dirac velocity vanishes. The density of states (DOS)
then diverges at the Dirac point as $\rho(E)\sim E^{(2/z)-1}$ with $z\gg 1$ and
we deduce that all electrons occupy energies very near $E=0$. We prove a sum
rule on the disorder averaged eigenfunctions from which we deduce that each
added electron contributes equal intraband Coulomb interaction energy. The
various bands in TBG are related by either ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow {\bf
A}({-\bf r})$ or ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow -{\bf A}({\bf r})$ which affects
the interband interaction energy. We find, within Hartree-Fock, jumps in the
chemical potential at each integer filling, accounting for the cascade
transitions.

Abstract: Topological features of possible three-dimensional (3D) states in \alpha-type
layered organic conductors are investigated within a unified framework based on
Wannier charge centers (WCCs), aiming to identify their actual topological
states. Among the 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetal states of multilayered
\alpha-(ET)2I3, the type-I Dirac semimetal state, induced by interlayer
spin-orbit coupling (SOC), most effectively explains the observed chiral
transport phenomena attributed to the chiral magnetic effect, which originates
from the spiral structures of the WCC sheets. In multilayered \alpha-(BETS)2I3,
a 3D weak topological insulator (TI) state consistently emerges, irrespective
of the presence of interlayer SOC and/or inversion symmetry breaking. The
strong TI state suggested by experimental observations appears unlikely to be
realized.

Abstract: Quantized conductance from topologically protected edge states is a hallmark
of two-dimensional topological phases. In contrast, edge states in
one-dimensional (1D) topological systems cannot transmit current across the
insulating bulk, rendering their topological nature invisible in transport. In
this work, we investigate the transport properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model with gain and loss, and show that the zero-energy conductance exhibits
qualitatively distinct behaviors between the topologically trivial and
nontrivial phases, depending on the hybridization and dissipation strengths.
Crucially, we analytically demonstrate that the conductance can become
half-quantized in the topologically nontrivial phase, a feature absent in the
trivial phase. We further show that the half quantization predominantly
originates from transport channels involving gain/loss and edge states. Our
results uncover a new mechanism for realizing quantized transport in 1D
topological systems and highlight the nontrivial role of dissipation in
enabling topological signatures in open quantum systems.

longitudinal components. The magnetic-moment spin Hall angle exceeds unity,

Abstract: Experimental observations of vibronic coherences in electronically excited
colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals offer a window into the ultrafast dynamics
of hot carrier cooling. In previous work, we showed that, in amine-passivated
quantum dots (QDs), these coherences arise during relaxation through a cascade
of conical intersections between electronically excited states. Here, we
demonstrate the generality of this framework by application to QDs with
surface-bound carboxylate ligands. A model involving a similar cascade of
conical intersections accurately reproduces the frequencies of vibronic
coherences observed with broadband multidimensional spectroscopy. The impact of
ligands on the relaxation dynamics is attributed to two distinct mechanisms
involving either electronic or vibrational coupling between the core and
ligands. Compared to the amine-passivated QDs studied previously, the
electronic coupling mechanism is less prominent in carboxylate-passivated QDs.
Furthermore, comparison of acetate and formate ligands reveals that truncating
the ligand alkyl chains alters the relaxation behavior predicted by the model.

Abstract: The quantum geometry, comprising Berry curvature and quantum metric, plays a
fundamental role in governing electron transport phenomena in solids. Recent
studies show that the quantum metric dipole drives scattering-free nonlinear
Hall effect in topological antiferromagnets, prompting the questions of whether
this effect can occur in nonmagnetic systems and be externally tuned by a
magnetic field. Our work addresses these frontiers by demonstrating that the
quantum metric dipole is actively tuned by an external magnetic field to
generate a time-reversal-odd nonlinear Hall response in a nonmagnetic
topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Alongside the well-known
chiral-anomaly-induced negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, an exotic
nonlinear planar Hall effect emerges with increasing magnetic field. Careful
scaling analysis indicates that this nonlinear planar Hall effect is controlled
by the magnetic-field-modulated quantum metric dipole. Constructing a k.p
effective model of the Dirac bands under Zeeman and orbital coupling, we derive
the evolution of the quantum metric dipole as a function of the magnetic field,
providing a comprehensive explanation of the experimental results. Our results
establish a band-structure-based strategy for engineering nonlinear
magnetotransport in nonmagnetic materials via the quantum metric dipole,
opening a pathway toward magnetic-field-tunable nonlinear quantum devices.

Abstract: Moir\'e flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a platform for
exploring interaction-driven topological phases, where a single isolated band
often forms a Chern band. However, non-Abelian degenerate Chern bands with
internal symmetries such as SU($N$) have so far been realized only in highly
engineered systems. Here, we show that a doubly degenerate non-Abelian Chern
band with Chern number $|C|=1$ emerges spontaneously at filling $\nu=2$ in
rhombohedral 3-, 4-, and 5-layer graphene, regardless of the presence of an hBN
substrate. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we map out phase
diagrams as functions of displacement field and electronic periodicity, and
analytically demonstrate that the Fock term drives spontaneous symmetry
breaking and generates non-Abelian Berry curvature. Our findings unveil a new

Abstract: Graphene provides an excellent platform for investigating electron quantum
interference due to its outstanding coherent properties. In the quantum Hall
regime, Mach--Zehnder (MZ) electronic interferometers are realized using p--n
junctions in graphene, where electron interference is highly protected against
decoherence. In this work, we present a phenomenological framework for
graphene-based MZ interferometry with asymmetric p--n junction configurations.
We show that the enclosed interferometer area can be tuned by asymmetric gate
potentials, and additional MZ pathways emerge in higher-filling-factor
scenarios, e.g. $\left(\nu_{n},\nu_{p}\right)=\left(-3,+3\right)$. The
resulting complicated beat oscillations in asymmetric-gate MZ interference are
efficiently analyzed using a machine-learning--based Fourier transform, which
yields improved peak-to-background ratios compared to conventional
signal-processing techniques. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the
asymmetric gate on the interference visibility, finding that interference
visibility is enhanced under symmetric gate conditions.

Conclusion: 强选择性磁子-声子相互作用解释了观察到的声子模式分裂，并更新了CoPS$_3$的磁性参数。

Abstract: The Raman scattering response of the biaxial antiferromagnet CoPS$_3$ has
been investigated as a function of both magnetic field and temperature. The
peaks observed in the low-frequency spectral range (90--200~cm$^{-1}$) have
been identified as hybrid magnon--phonon excitations. The energies of the bare
magnon and phonon modes, as well as the effective coupling strengths between
different excitation pairs, have been determined. The strong and selective
magnon--phonon interaction largely accounts for the pronounced splitting of two
phonon-like modes observed at 152~cm$^{-1}$ and 158~cm$^{-1}$ in the
antiferromagnetic phase of CoPS$_3$. Based on the identification of bare magnon
excitations and their magnetic-field dependence, we propose an updated set of
parameters for the effective exchange ($J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 9.9$~meV) and
biaxial magnetic anisotropy ($D = 4.3$~meV and $E = -0.7$~meV) and advocate for
an apparent anisotropic $g$-factor ($g_x = g_y = 2$, $g_z = 4$) in the CoPS$_3$
antiferromagnet.

Abstract: The LnSbTe family is well known for hosting a plethora of intriguing
characteristics stemming from its crystalline symmetry, magnetic structure, 4f
electronic correlations and spin orbit coupling (SOC) phenomena. In this paper,
we have systematically studied the bulk electrical and thermodynamic properties
and electronic structure of the nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe using
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) corroborated with first
principles based theoretical band structure calculations with and without
considering the effect of SOC, a critical factor dictating the band degeneracy
which depends on the choice of the Ln atom. Corroborative temperature dependent
susceptibility, electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements,
coherently exhibit paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition
approximately at 1.94 K, and another sharp anomaly at 1.75 K. The zero field
cooled resistivity measurement does not show the characteristic hump like
feature in the other LnSbTe materials. The electronic band structure of ErSbTe,
exhibits a diamond shaped Fermi surface. Along the high symmetry direction GX,
electronic bands are projected to cross over the Fermi energy, necessitated by
the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the system. The other crossing along this
direction is gapped, which evolves along the momentum space reaching its
maximum along the GM direction.

Conclusion: 该理论框架为有限尺寸系统中的非线性霍尔效应提供了全面理解，并为未来研究提供了分析工具。

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has attracted considerable attention and undergone
extensive investigation in recent years. However, theoretical studies
addressing size-dependent effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
establish a unified semiclassical framework based on the Boltzmann transport
equation, incorporating generalized boundary conditions to bridge the ballistic
and diffusive transport regimes. Our analysis reveals that the nonlinear Hall
effect arises from the combined action of two distinct mechanisms: the Berry
curvature dipole and the Fermi-surface integral of Berry curvature.
Furthermore, we investigate the Hall effect in topological crystalline
insulators (TCIs), elucidating that the size dependence originates from
competition between the two transport mechanisms. By connecting the two
distinct regimes, our theoretical framework provides a comprehensive
understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect in finite-sized systems, offering
both fundamental insights and a useful analytical tool for more size-dependent
investigations.

Abstract: Accurately modeling interfacial thermal transport in van der Waals
heterostructures is challenging due to the limited availability of interlayer
interaction potentials. We develop a pairwise interlayer potential for
graphene/germanene van der Waals heterostructure using the binding energy
obtained from ab-initio density functional theory calculations and use it to
calculate the interfacial thermal conductivity. Our calculations reveal that
the interfacial thermal conductivity shows superior tunability with external
strain. The phonon density of states calculations show a blueshift in the
phonon spectra with an applied compressive strain in the direction of heat
flow, increasing the interfacial thermal conductance to $\sim$136% of the
unstrained value. In contrast, a tensile strain is found to cause an opposite
effect, reducing the conductance to $\sim$70% of the unstrained value.
Moreover, due to increased availability of phonons for heat transfer, both
temperature and interaction strength are found to correlate positively with the
interfacial thermal conductance for both directions of heat flow.

Conclusion: 石墨烯中自旋和赝自旋自由度既有相似性也有差异，为相关研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into
account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a
simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based
on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing
the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift
retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's
vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift
arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice.
The Mashhoon fringe shift, which characterizes the dynamics of intrinsic spin,
retains its conventional form in graphene, with its dependence on the Fermi
velocity. Our analysis highlights both the similarities and differences between
spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in graphene.

Abstract: As integrated circuits continue to scale down and adopt three-dimensional
(3D) stacking, thermal management in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) has emerged as
a critical design constraint. In this study, we present a combined experimental
and simulation framework to quantitatively characterize and mechanistically
understand thermal transport in BEOL multilayers. Using the Square-Pulsed
Source (SPS) method, a time-resolved optical metrology technique, we measure
cross-plane thermal resistance and areal heat capacity in semiconductor chips
at nanometer resolution. Two fabricated chip samples, polished to the M4 and M6
interconnection layers, are analyzed to extract thermal properties of distinct
multilayer stacks. Results show that thermal resistance follows a series model,
while areal heat capacity scales linearly with metal content. To uncover the
underlying physical mechanisms, we perform finite element simulations using
COMSOL Multiphysics, examining the influence of via connectivity and dielectric
thermal conductivity on effective cross-plane heat transport. The simulations
reveal that dielectric materials, due to their large volume fraction, are the
primary limiting factor in BEOL thermal conduction, while the via structure
plays a secondary but significant role. This combined experimental-simulation
approach provides mechanistic insight into heat transport in advanced IC
architectures and offers practical guidance for optimizing thermal pathways in
future high-performance 3D-stacked devices.

faster modeling, theoretical characterization, and more. QVNTVS performs energy
level and wavefunction calculations, recombination probability, transition
energy, and optical emission computations quickly and accurately. Contrasting
with the existing simulators, QVNTVS is an open-source project and can produce
solutions for niche problems like potential wells under an electric field,
heterojunctions, recombination, and transition matrices. QVNTVS simulates QWs
by solving the Time-Independent Schr\"odinger Equation for different potential
profiles in a discretized space using the finite-difference method and computes
the properties of the device using the extracted information from the solution.
The results align with the analytical calculations and the experimental data.

Abstract: Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics,
combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows
for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of
SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to
address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other
two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable
spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in
next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to
the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for
both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for
in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the
unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$
interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the
conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the
bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a
wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.

Conclusion: 拉比振荡在SOA中可实现周期性噪声压缩，为噪声控制和量子光学应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generation of squeezed light is usually implemented in nonlinear \c{hi}(2) or
\c{hi}(3) materials. Semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs) also
offer non-linearities but they differ from passive elements in that they add
amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE). In a semiconductor laser, squeezing
to below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity
and it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to
squeezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but
often the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier.
At the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Short resonant pulses interacting with a
quantum dot SOA induce coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations. Here, we
demonstrate, for the first time, that Rabi oscillations cause cyclical noise
squeezing which varies periodically with the excitation pulse area. The noise
in the present experiments does not reach the quantum limit so we term this
condition quasi squeezing. It occurs during the portions of the Rabi cycle when
the quantum dots provide gain and repeats with every fourfold increase of the
pulse excitation energy which amounts to a 2{\pi} increase in pulse area. In
all other cases, the noise exhibits the properties of a coherent state.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments
generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a
protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate
properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices,
heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching,
which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are
primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes,
limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal
scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in
vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with
nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an
electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate
charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport
measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability
oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.

Abstract: In gate-defined quantum dot systems, the conductance change of
electrostatically coupled sensor dots allows the observation of the quantum
dots' charge and spin states. Therefore, the sensor dot must be optimally
sensitive to changes in its electrostatic environment. A series of conductance
measurements varying the two sensor-dot-forming barrier gate voltages serve to
tune the dot into a corresponding operating regime. In this paper, we analyze
the noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to
identify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio.
Hence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal
operating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators,
modify them for 1D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality
based on simulated data. The estimator of Chen et al. turns out to be best
suited for our application concerning minimally scattering results.
Furthermore, using this estimator in an algorithm for flank-of-interest
classification in measured data shows the relevance and applicability of our
approach.

Abstract: Quantum dots must be tuned precisely to provide a suitable basis for quantum
computation. A scalable platform for quantum computing can only be achieved by
fully automating the tuning process. One crucial step is to trap the
appropriate number of electrons in the quantum dots, typically accomplished by
analyzing charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Training and testing automation
algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be either measured and
manually labeled in an experiment or simulated. This article introduces a new
approach to the realistic simulation of such measurements. Our flexible
framework enables the simulation of ideal CSD data complemented with
appropriate sensor responses and distortions. We suggest using this simulation
to benchmark published algorithms. Also, we encourage the extension by custom
models and parameter sets to drive the development of robust,

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of a quantum system in a given parameter
space captures both the geometry of the state manifold and the topology of the
system. While the local QGT elements have been successfully measured in various
platforms, the challenge of detecting them in electronic transport systems -
such as tunnel or molecular junctions - has yet to be resolved. To fill this
gap, we propose a measurement protocol based on weak and resonant parameter
modulations, and theoretically demonstrate how the local QGT in such systems
can be directly probed from changes of the tunnel conductance. This approach
enables the measurement of both geometrical and topological features of quantum
states in a broad class of transport-based quantum systems.
