We define QNODEs as the evolution of finite-dimensional\nquantum systems, and QNPDEs as infinite-dimensional (continuous-variable)\ncounterparts, governed by generalised Schrodinger-type Hamiltonian dynamics\nwith unitary evolution, coupled with a corresponding loss function. Notably,\nthis formalism permits gradient estimation using an adjoint-state method,\nfacilitating efficient learning of quantum dynamics, and other dynamics that\ncan be mapped (relatively easily) to quantum dynamics. Using this method, we\npresent quantum algorithms for computing gradients with and without time\ndiscretisation, enabling efficient gradient computation that would otherwise be\nless efficient on classical devices.\n  The formalism subsumes a wide array of applications, including quantum state\npreparation, Hamiltonian learning, learning dynamics in open systems, and the\nlearning of both autonomous and non-autonomous classical ODEs and PDEs. In many\nof these applications, we consider scenarios where the Hamiltonian has\nrelatively few tunable parameters, yet the corresponding classical simulation\nremains inefficient, making quantum approaches advantageous for gradient\nestimation.

In this context, drag refers to the appearance of a\nstationary voltage in the passive wire in response to a current bias applied to\nthe active one. Quantum phase slips (QPS) in the biased wire generate voltage\nfluctuations that can be transmitted to the other. Using perturbative and\nsemiclassical approaches, we show that when both wires are superconducting the\ninduced voltage vanishes due to exact cancellation of plasmon contributions. By\ncontrast, when the second wire is tuned below the superconductor-insulator\ntransition and develops a mass gap, this cancellation is lifted and a finite\ndrag voltage emerges. The drag coefficient exhibits a crossover from weak drag\nin short wires to a maximal value set by the mutual capacitance in long wires.\nA semiclassical picture of voltage pulse propagation clarifies the physical\norigin of the effect: the mass term synchronizes plasmon modes and prevents\ncomplete cancellation of induced signals. Our results establish a mechanism of\nmass-induced Coulomb drag in low-dimensional superconductors and suggest new\nroutes for probing nonlocal transport near quantum criticality."}

The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure\nhigh field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We\npresent a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with\nfocused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully\ncharacterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\\,\\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly\nmeasured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin\ncoherence was preserved at the value of $20\\,\\mathrm{ \\mu s}$ up to a gradient\nof $25\\,\\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin\ndynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling.\nGiven the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee\nthe adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor\nresonators, in the \"magnet on oscillator\" configuration."}

We demonstrate a hole\nmobility reaching up to 1000 cm2/V.s in a 17 nm thick flake at 30 Kelvin. At\ndeep cryogenic temperatures (< 50mK), the transport characteristics transition\nfrom Coulomb blockade in the low carrier density regime to pronounced\nFabry-P\\'erot (F-P) interference at higher densities. Notably, the visibility\nof these F-P oscillations is significantly enhanced in the thinner flake\ndevice. The application of a magnetic field reveals a clear Zeeman splitting of\nthe conductance peaks. The rich variety of quantum transport phenomena observed\nunderscores the high quality of our thin Te flakes and establishes them as a\npromising platform for exploring novel physics and device concepts, such as\ntopological superconductivity and low-power spintronic applications."}
