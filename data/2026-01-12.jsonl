This research introduces a physics-inspired adaptive reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to autonomously interact with physical environments, simultaneously identifying both the critical temperature and various types of critical exponents in the Ising model with precision. Interestingly, our algorithm exhibits search behavior reminiscent of phase transitions, efficiently converging to target parameters regardless of initial conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms traditional approaches, particularly in environments with strong perturbations. This study not only incorporates physical concepts into machine learning to enhance algorithm interpretability but also establishes a new paradigm for scientific exploration, transitioning from manual analysis to autonomous AI discovery."}

In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet."}

Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\\text{mix}} = \\exp [Ω(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories."}

Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated.\n  Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics.

In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles."}

We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atomic gases have been an ideal platform for studying many-body quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity, and simultaneously providing an opportunity to broaden our understanding of classical hydrodynamics into quantum systems. In this review, we introduce a range of experimental studies on the pattern formation in quantum fluids of atomic gases under external driving, including Faraday waves in one and two dimensions, surface patterns, and counterflow instabilities in a mixture of superfluids. The pattern formation in the quantum system can be understood through the parametric amplification process, where an unstable dynamical mode can be exponentially amplified, similar to classical systems. Remarkably, the governing equations for surface excitations of trapped BECs can be mathematically equivalent to those of shallow water, indicating a universal description of the hydrodynamic instability across classical and quantum domains. However, the condensates, as superfluids, also possess fundamental quantum characteristics, such as quantized vorticity and a distinct dissipation channel. These unique features showcase many-body fragmentation under strong modulation and the generation of vortices in the nonlinear regime, which could offer a pathway to the study of quantum turbulence. Furthermore, the coexistence of long-range phase coherence and density modulation in driven condensates could provide unexplored features, such as those seen in supersolid-like sound modes, within nonequilibrium settings."}

Yet their practical usefulness and performance depend critically on reliability, quantified by the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs), i.e., normalized fluctuations of work and power, where reliability decreases inversely with increasing NSR. We establish fundamental limits to this reliability: both work and power NSRs are universally bounded from below by a function of charging speed, imposing a reliability limit inherent to any quantum battery. More strikingly, we find that a quantum mechanical uncertainty relation forbids the simultaneous suppression of work and power fluctuations, revealing a fundamental trade-off that also limits the reliability of quantum batteries. We analyze the trade-off and limits, as well as their scaling behavior, across parallel (local), collective {(fully non-local)}, and hybrid (semi-local) charging schemes for many-body quantum batteries, finding that increasing power by exploiting stronger entanglement comes at the cost of diminished reliability of power. Similar trends are also observed in the charging of quantum batteries utilizing transverse Ising-like interactions. These suggest that achieving both high power and reliability require neither parallel nor collective charging, but a hybrid charging scheme with an intermediate range of interactions. Therefore, our analysis shapes the practical and efficient design of reliable and high-performance quantum batteries."}

Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the Néel temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr."}

In real materials, this problem has been extensively studied in transition metal compounds, where various quantum phenomena arise from the spin and orbital degeneracy of the d electrons on individual transition-metal atoms. In contrast, materials containing high-symmetry clusters composed of multiple transition-metal atoms are expected to exhibit more emergent phenomena due to the entanglement of the electronic degrees of freedom across multiple atoms. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct mechanisms of orbital-degeneracy lifting in NbSeI, which comprises Nb4 tetrahedral clusters with molecular orbital degrees of freedom and whose average crystal structure is predicted to host a flat-band metal. Below 106 K, NbSeI is found to be a nonmagnetic molecular orbital-ordered insulator. Above this temperature, the average structure becomes face-centered cubic without any superlattice, while the orbital degeneracy remains lifted by significant local distortions of Nb4 tetrahedra, which may be associated with a molecular orbital-liquid or orbital-frozen state. This noncooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes a nonmagnetic insulating state above 106 K, in stark contrast to the flat-band metal predicted from the average structure."}

In the present work, we study the breaking of Quantum Darwinism in a specific model and how that translates to non-classical measurement statistics.

These devices employ a broadband infrared emitter, thermopile detector, and a spectrally selective bandpass filter tuned to the vibrational resonance of the target analyte. However, the fabrication of these filters is costly and limited to a single frequency. This limitation introduces a fundamental tradeoff, as broadening the optical passband width enhances sensitivity but compromises selectivity, whereas narrowing improves selectivity at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we validate a filterless NDIR approach using a multi-peak thermal emitter developed through inverse design. This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications."}

At a low temperature (T = 30 K) in the CO ordered phase, the Yb $4f$ valence remains nearly constant up to a pressure P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa, and then increases gradually at higher pressures. In contrast, at room temperature in the normal phase, an anomalous decrease of the Yb $4f$ valence is observed, without any accompanying structural phase transition. This behavior is corroborated by a systematic pressure dependent decrease of the unit-cell volume. Based on a Birch-Murnaghan analysis, the compressibility indicates hardening of the lattice with applied pressure up to a distinct kink seen at P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa. In contrast, for P $>$ P$_K$, the Yb $4f$ valency saturates and the compressibility reveals a counterintuitive pressure-induced softening.

However, distinguishing the roles of Kitaev interactions and the symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) remains challenging, since both mechanisms may lead to similar magnetic excitations and thermal transport properties. To tackle this challenge, using a ferromagnetic honeycomb insulator VI3 as a model system, we systematically study the angular-dependent thermal Hall conductivity Kxy(θ, Φ) with both out-of-plane (θ) and in-plane (Φ) magnetic field rotations. Our results reveal a persistent thermal Hall response for both out-of-plane and in-plane rotating magnetic fields, devoid of the sign-reversal patterns characteristic of Kitaev physics. Instead, quantitative analysis shows that the angular dependent Kxy(θ, Φ) is governed by the projection between the magnetic moment and a tilted DM vector containing both out-of-plane and in-plane components. These results not only establish the DMI-driven topological magnetic excitations as the origin of the thermal Hall response in VI3 but also highlight the angular-dependent thermal Hall effect measurements as an effective approach for distinguishing competing interactions in quantum magnets."}

A notable example is estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise using the repetition code, which is both optimal for metrology and robust against noise. However, previous protocols often assume noise affects only the signal accumulation step, while the QEC operations -- including state preparation and measurement -- are noiseless. To overcome this limitation, we study fault-tolerant quantum metrology where all qubit operations are subject to noise. We focus on estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise, together with state preparation and measurement errors in all QEC operations. We propose a fault-tolerant metrological protocol where a repetition code is prepared via repeated syndrome measurements, followed by a fault-tolerant logical measurement. We demonstrate the existence of an error threshold, below which errors are effectively suppressed and the HL is attained."}

Collisional interactions during storage then implement one-axis-twisting dynamics and generate spin squeezing in the atomic ensemble. We account for realistic loss and finite memory and retrieval efficiencies, and model readout as a single-mode beam-splitter mapping that transfers the atomic quadrature squeezing onto a propagating optical mode.

These states, called Chern insulators, are usually understood as replicas of the ground states of the quantum Hall effect, with electrical and thermal conductances that should be quantized, reflecting their topological order. The Hofstadter butterfly is now commonly observed in van-der-Waals heterostructures-based moiré superlattices. However, its thermal properties, particularly the quantized heat flow expected in the Chern insulators, have not been investigated, potentially questioning their similarity with standard quantum Hall states. Here we probe the heat transport properties of the Hofstadter butterfly, obtained in a graphene~/~hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattice. We observe a quantized heat flow, uniquely set by the topological invariant, for all investigated states of the Hofstadter butterfly: quantum Hall states, Chern insulators, and even symmetry-broken Chern insulators emerging from strong electronic interactions. Our work firmly establishes the universality of the quantization of heat transport and its intimate link with topology."}

We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles."}

At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV.

By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems.

In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet."}

Our approach leverages the intrinsic ion-phonon interactions, where two trapped ions, each interacting with a shared vibrational mode, are driven on both red- and blue-sideband transitions. This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems. Our findings provide new insights into the realization of squeezed states in phonon-based systems, with potential applications in quantum metrology and information processing."}

This twist angle dependence directly impacts the exciton-phonon coupling, which plays a significant role for the optical properties of these materials. In this work we theoretically investigate the twist angle dependent influence of phonons on absorption spectra of intralayer moiré excitons in a twisted TMDC hetero-bilayer. For the lowest-lying intralayer moiré exciton we find that the exciton-phonon coupling interpolates between two physically distinct regimes when tuning the twist angle. At small twist angles non-Markovian polarization dynamics and phonon sidebands dominate the properties of absorption spectra for localized excitons. For larger twist angles Markovian processes become more important leading to additional line broadening. Furthermore, the absorption spectra here show a characteristic asymmetric peak similar to monolayer TMDCs. When taking into account multiple bright moiré exciton bands we find that intraband scattering due to optical phonons has a significant impact on absorption spectra, effectively suppressing absorption peaks of higher lying bands when their bandwidth surpasses the optical phonon energy."}

In the lossless scenario, we show that uniformly applied OPA significantly enhances the attainable precision beyond that of an unamplified interferometer. By analyzing the second-order correlation functions, we demonstrate that this enhancement originates from the amplification of intra-mode photon-number correlations, rather than from inter-mode correlations. We further extend our analysis to realistic interferometers with photon loss using a purification-based variational approach. Although loss degrades the achievable precision, the OPA-assisted scheme retains a clear advantage for moderate loss, indicating a degree of robustness against dissipation. Our results clarify the physical mechanism underlying OPA-enhanced multiparameter quantum metrology and provide guidelines for optimizing phase estimation protocols in realistic noisy environments."}

Our analysis of the classical phase-space structure and its excited-state quantum phase transitions leads us to three dynamical regimes: symmetry-breaking low-energy states, an intermediate region where quantum and classical equilibrium states markedly disagree, and a high-energy regime with restored correspondence. The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space. This mismatch originates from the population of imbalance-carrying eigenstates and persists even for relatively large number of particles.

Its core input model is the block encoding framework, in which non-unitary matrices are embedded into larger unitary matrices. Because the gate complexity of the block-encoding subroutine largely determines the overall cost of QSVT-based algorithms, developing new and more efficient block encodings is crucial for achieving practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for constructing quantum circuits that block encode linear combinations of Pauli strings. Our approach relies on two key components. First, we apply a transformation that converts the Pauli strings into pairwise anti-commuting ones, making the transformed linear combination unitary and thus directly implementable as a quantum circuit. Second, we employ a correction transformation based on the stabilizer formalism which uses an ancilla register to restore the original Pauli strings. Our method can be implemented with an ancilla register whose size scales logarithmically with the number of system qubits. It can also be extended to larger ancilla registers, which can substantially reduce the overall quantum circuit complexity. We present four concrete examples and use numerical simulations to compare our method's circuit complexity with that of the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) approach. We find that our method achieves circuit complexities comparable to or better than LCU, with possible advantages when the structure of the target operators can be exploited. These results suggest that our approach could enable more efficient block encodings for a range of relevant problems extending beyond the examples analyzed in this work."}

We demonstrate that the BCD's evolution with strain and doping is highly sensitive to the choice in parameterization, particularly when including the longer range interlayer skew hoppings.

When the interaction vanishes, QIBD reduces to the classical Bhattacharyya distance; however, for entangling interactions, it cannot be expressed as a function of fidelity alone. Numerical simulations demonstrate that QIBD responds to correlation structure in ways that overlap-based measures do not, suggesting potential utility in contexts where interaction-aligned correlations are physically relevant."}

A mode-resolved analysis reveals how propagating and evanescent channels couple across electrostatic interfaces and how channel selectivity governs transport at normal incidence. We show that, even when decoupled channels remain inactive, perfect transmission can occur at discrete energies due to phase matching of a single internal mode within an individual barrier. This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference. Our results provide a unified, channel-resolved description of tunnelling suppression and resonance-assisted transport in bilayer graphene barrier systems."}

We experimentally demonstrate scalable, optimal photon distillation as a substantially more resource-efficient strategy to reduce indistinguishability errors in a way that is compatible with fault-tolerant operation. Photon distillation is an intrinsically bosonic, coherent error-mitigation technique which exploits quantum interference to project single photons into purified internal states, thereby reducing indistinguishability errors at both a higher efficiency and higher threshold than quantum error correction. We observe unconditional error reduction (i.e., below-threshold behaviour) consistent with theoretical predictions, even when accounting for noise introduced by the distillation gate, thereby achieving actual net-gain error mitigation under conditions relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing.

This work opens a new direction for achieving high-fidelity analogue quantum simulation in the presence of noise."}

On the other hand, counterdiabatic algorithms have shown advantages in both performance and circuit depth when compared to standard adiabatic approaches. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that integrates the ADAPT-VQE framework with counterdiabatic driving within an adiabatic evolution scheme. Specifically, we map the molecular Hamiltonian to a qubit representation and construct an adiabatic Hamiltonian, from which an approximate adiabatic gauge potential is computed using nested commutators. The resulting operator terms define the operator pool, and the ADAPT-VQE algorithm is applied to iteratively select the most relevant elements for the ansatz. Our results demonstrate improvements in performance and reductions in circuit depth compared to using either counterdiabatic algorithms or ADAPT-VQE with fermionic excitation operators, thus supporting the effectiveness of combining both paradigms in molecular simulations."}

By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity."}

Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems."}

We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation."}

Distinguishing these two channels is essential for interpreting nonlinear and quantum-optical experiments based on high-$n$ states, yet their temporal, spectral, and power-dependent signatures often overlap. Here we use time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation to cleanly separate SHG and SE and to map how each depends on $n$, temperature, excitation power, and crystal quality. This approach reveals the markedly different sensitivities of the two processes to phonons, defects, and many-body effects, and establishes practical criteria for identifying SE and SHG in a wide range of experimental conditions. Our results provide a unified framework for interpreting emission from Rydberg excitons and offer guidelines for future studies aiming to exploit their nonlinear response and long-range interactions."}

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atomic gases have been an ideal platform for studying many-body quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity, and simultaneously providing an opportunity to broaden our understanding of classical hydrodynamics into quantum systems. In this review, we introduce a range of experimental studies on the pattern formation in quantum fluids of atomic gases under external driving, including Faraday waves in one and two dimensions, surface patterns, and counterflow instabilities in a mixture of superfluids. The pattern formation in the quantum system can be understood through the parametric amplification process, where an unstable dynamical mode can be exponentially amplified, similar to classical systems. Remarkably, the governing equations for surface excitations of trapped BECs can be mathematically equivalent to those of shallow water, indicating a universal description of the hydrodynamic instability across classical and quantum domains. However, the condensates, as superfluids, also possess fundamental quantum characteristics, such as quantized vorticity and a distinct dissipation channel. These unique features showcase many-body fragmentation under strong modulation and the generation of vortices in the nonlinear regime, which could offer a pathway to the study of quantum turbulence. Furthermore, the coexistence of long-range phase coherence and density modulation in driven condensates could provide unexplored features, such as those seen in supersolid-like sound modes, within nonequilibrium settings."}

Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\\text{mix}} = \\exp [Ω(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories."}
