However, relying on a\nseparate light source increases the overhead in the experimental apparatus.\nMoreover, the beacon light must closely match the non-classical state in\npolarization, wavelength, and even temporal bandwidth, which is highly\nchallenging in practice. Here, we introduce a fast and efficient wavefront\ncorrection approach where we use the quantum state itself to correct for\noptical distortion. Via pump shaping, we control the degree of entanglement in\nthe spatially-entangled two-photon state so that it behaves either as a\nhigh-dimensional entangled state or as a classical coherent state. The latter\ncase is used to efficiently measure the transmission matrix of the propagation\nchannel and correct its distortions with a spatial light modulator, thereby\nenabling the transmission of the high-dimensional entangled state with minimal\nerrors. Our approach paves the way for the practical implementation of quantum\nimaging and communication protocols based on high-dimensional spatially\nentangled states."}

These lines intersect at a TCP\nand a UCEP, the latter not captured by existing phase-transition paradigms. The\nUCEP displays one-sided criticality: approaching the point from one side, the\nsystem behaves as a second-order transition, while from the other side it is\nfirst-order. Correspondingly, two order parameters, respectively, undergo the\nfirst- and the second-order phase transitions at the same point. We construct a\nminimal description of UCEP with the density of the free energy $f =\nc_{1}(\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})+(\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})^{2}\\ln{\\vert\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}+c_{2}\\vert}$,\nwith the UCEP at $(c_{1},c_{2})=(1/e,0)$ and $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ being the order\nparameter. We further map the finite-temperature phase diagram and perform a\nsymmetry analysis. By unifying first- and second-order signatures in a single,\ndirection-dependent endpoint, the UCEP introduces a qualitatively new class of\nphase transition and may have applications in fields such as quantum\nmeasurement and quantum sensing. This work also provides an intriguing platform\nfor exploring novel critical phenomena in cavity-coupled many-body systems with\nor without dissipation."}

Such engineered\nprofiles enable configurations that balance the high efficiency of sharp\nLorentzian resonances with the high power output of boxcar-like spectra,\nyielding near-optimal power-efficiency trade-offs. For symmetric quantum-dot\narrays in square, pentagonal, and hexagonal configurations, we identify an\noptimal regime, $t/\\gamma \\approx 2$, where the interdot tunneling amplitude\n$t$ and the dot-lead coupling $\\gamma$ yield the best balance of power and\nefficiency. A hexagonal six-dot configuration achieves $ZT \\sim 30$ at dilution\ntemperatures, while the four-dot geometry reaches about $76\\%$ of Carnot\nefficiency with output power $4.74$ fW. We also find a direct correspondence\nbetween the high-$ZT$ regime and maximal violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law.\nIntroducing source-drain coupling asymmetry further enhances both efficiency\nand power. A scaling analysis reveals that efficiency systematically increases\nwith the number of quantum dots, whereas power output is maximized at\nintermediate system sizes.

Using a functional renormalization group (FRG)\napproach, we demonstrate that the low-energy physics is controlled by a\nnonperturbative fixed point. The universal energy crossover in both the linear\nconductance and the impurity entropy is obtained. We reproduce the\nzero-frequency conductance and the leading low-energy exponent of the\nthree-channel Kondo model, confirming their universality across all\ntransparencies. For interacting leads -- a model that continuously connects to\nthe pseudo-gap Kondo model at low transparency -- we find a line of fixed\npoints as the Luttinger parameter $K$, which encodes the strength of the\ninteractions, changes.
