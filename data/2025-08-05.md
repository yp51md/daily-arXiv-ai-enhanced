### [1] [Proof of Hiding Conjecture in Gaussian Boson Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00983)
*Laura Shou,Sarah H. Miller,Victor Galitski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文证明了高斯玻色采样（GBS）中的“隐藏猜想”，即在实验相关条件下，一个$o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$的子矩阵可以近似为复高斯矩阵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了验证GBS在量子计算优势中的经典计算困难性，需要证明“隐藏猜想”在实验相关条件下的成立。

Method: 通过分析$M\times M$圆形正交系综（COE）随机矩阵的子矩阵，证明其在总变差距离下可以近似为复高斯矩阵。

Result: 首次在实验相关条件下严格证明了GBS的“隐藏猜想”，为GBS的经典模拟困难性提供了与常规玻色采样相当的理论支持。

Conclusion: 该研究为GBS在量子计算优势中的实际应用奠定了理论基础，并填补了实验相关条件下理论证明的空白。

Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating
quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical
hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one
can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of
Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove
the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed
states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen
et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states
that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular
orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex
Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first
rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant
regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a
maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the
conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143
(2013)].

Conclusion: 研究为非线性成像技术的量子科学应用提供了明确路径，连接了传统显微技术与量子技术的新能力。

Abstract: Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering is a widely used imaging technique that
provides chemical contrast without the need for labels, making it an extremely
valuable tool in physics, chemistry, and biology. In this work, we explore its
fundamental precision limits by applying tools from quantum information theory.
We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that spatial mode
demultiplexing--a technique already accessible in current experimental
setups--can achieve these quantum limits and in many situations improve the
sensitivity of conventional intensity measurements. Building on this, we
introduce an advanced imaging scheme based on vortex beams, which we predict to
enhance the image information in the final quantum state of light and thereby
lead to even higher resolution and sensitivity. These findings establish a
clear path for enhancing nonlinear imaging techniques using concepts from
quantum science, bridging the gap between established microscopy methods and
the emerging capabilities of quantum technologies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支持AFRL构建异构量子网络，推动量子计算、传感、计时和网络技术的发展。

Method: 开发多节点、可重构的QLANs，利用光子集成电路产生纠缠光子，并在不同环境中进行实验。

Result: 在树林环境中通过光纤成功分布时间-能量贝尔态纠缠光子，CHSH不等式违反值接近理论最大值（S=2.700）。

Conclusion: 未来工作将扩展QLAN功能，实现超导量子比特与囚禁离子等异构量子系统间的纠缠分布，验证了可部署量子网络的实用性。

Abstract: As quantum computing, sensing, timing, and networking technologies mature,
quantum network testbeds are being deployed across the United States and around
the world. To support the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)'s mission of
building heterogeneous quantum networks, we report on the development of
Quantum Local Area Networks (QLANs) operating at telecommunications-band
frequencies. The multi-node, reconfigurable QLANs include deployed optical
fiber and free-space links connected to pristine laboratory environments and
rugged outdoor test facilities. Each QLAN is tailored to distinct operating
conditions and use cases, with unique environmental characteristics and
capabilities. We present network topologies and in-depth link characterization
data for three such networks. Using photonic integrated circuit-based sources
of entangled photons, we demonstrate entanglement distribution of time-energy
Bell states across deployed fiber in a wooded environment. The high quality of
the entanglement is confirmed by a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality
violation of $S=2.700$, approaching the theoretical maximum of $S=2.828$. We
conclude with a discussion of future work aimed at expanding QLAN functionality
and enabling entanglement distribution between heterogeneous matter-based
quantum systems, including superconducting qubits and trapped ions. These
results underscore the practical viability of field-deployable, qubit-agnostic
quantum network infrastructure.

### [4] [Demonstration of an always-on exchange-only spin qubit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01033)
*Joseph D. Broz,Jesse C. Hoke,Edwin Acuna,Jason R. Petta*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于同时交换脉冲的高保真量子控制方法，用于操作始终开启的交换自旋量子比特（AEON），显著降低了电路深度并防止泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交换自旋量子比特（EO）的量子门操作需要逐个脉冲交换相互作用，效率较低且易泄漏。本研究旨在通过同时脉冲多个非交换相互作用来提高效率和保真度。

Method: 在三角形量子点阵列中，使用同时交换脉冲操作AEON量子比特，并通过盲随机基准测试评估单量子比特Clifford门集的性能。

Result: 实现了平均Clifford门保真度$F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86%，表明高保真量子控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效实现EO双量子比特纠缠门和原生$i$-Toffoli门提供了可能。

Abstract: In conventional exchange-only (EO) spin qubit demonstrations, quantum gates
have been implemented using sequences of individually pulsed pairwise exchange
interactions with only one exchange coupling active at a time. Alternatively,
multiple non-commuting exchange interactions can be pulsed simultaneously,
reducing circuit depths and providing protection against leakage. We
demonstrate high-fidelity quantum control of an always-on exchange-only (AEON)
qubit, operated using simultaneous exchange pulses in a triangular quantum dot
(QD) array. We use blind randomized benchmarking to characterize the
performance of the full AEON single-qubit Clifford gate set, achieving an
average Clifford gate fidelity $F_{\rm C1}$ = 99.86\%. Extensions of this work
may enable more efficient EO two-qubit entangling gates as well as the
implementation of native $i$-Toffoli gates in Loss-DiVincenzo single-spin
qubits.

### [5] [QPP-RNG: A Conceptual Quantum System for True Randomness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01051)
*Randy Kuang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QSQS是一种基于量子启发的随机数生成系统，通过测量排序过程的确定性计数和非确定性时间，结合算法确定性和系统波动性，实现真正的随机数生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是将确定性算法过程与非确定性物理波动结合，为后量子密码系统提供物理基础的随机性生成方法。

Method: 提出QSQS框架，通过测量排序过程的两个共轭变量（计数和时间），利用CPU抖动和缓存延迟等动态因素重新种子PRNG，并通过模约简将偏态分布转化为均匀输出。

Result: 实验显示，随着重复因子增加，输出熵接近理论最大值（8位），卡方统计接近理想均匀性，分布从偏态趋于均匀。

Conclusion: QSQS为后量子密码系统提供了一种物理基础的随机性生成方法，结合了算法确定性和物理波动性。

Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the \emph{Quasi-Superposition
Quantum-inspired System (QSQS)} -- a conceptual quantum system for randomness
generation built on measuring two conjugate observables of a permutation
sorting process: the deterministic permutation count $n_p$ and the
fundamentally non-deterministic sorting time $t$. By analogy with quantum
systems, these observables are linked by an uncertainty-like constraint:
algorithmic determinism ensures structural uniformity, while system-level
fluctuations introduce irreducible unpredictability. We realize this framework
concretely as \emph{QPP-RNG}, a system-embedded, software-based true random
number generator (TRNG). In QPP-RNG, real-time measurements of sorting time $t$
-- shaped by CPU pipeline jitter, cache latency, and OS scheduling --
dynamically reseed the PRNG driving the permutation sequence. Crucially, QSQS
transforms initially right-skewed raw distributions of $n_p$ and $t$ into
nearly uniform outputs after modulo reduction, thanks to internal degeneracies
that collapse many distinct states into the same output symbol. Empirical
results show that as the repetition factor $m$ increases, output entropy
converges toward theoretical maxima: Shannon and min-entropy values approach 8
bits, chi-squared statistics stabilize near ideal uniformity, and bell curves
visually confirm the flattening from skewed to uniform distributions. Beyond
practical implications, QSQS unifies deterministic algorithmic processes with
non-deterministic physical fluctuations, offering a physics-based perspective
for engineering true randomness in post-quantum cryptographic systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种两级异频射频-微波转换器，结合可调静电预放大器和超导机电腔，实现高灵敏度电荷检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高灵敏度、低噪声的射频-微波转换器，用于超导微波电路和电荷/电压传感。

Method: 使用金属化Si3N4膜作为微波LC谐振器的可动板，通过直流偏置将小射频信号转换为谐振静电力，实现电压控制增益。

Result: 在10 mK下，49 V偏置时实现87 μe/√Hz的电荷灵敏度（0.9 nV/√Hz）。预测亚微米间隙和高Q值膜谐振器可实现亚200 fV/√Hz灵敏度。

Conclusion: 直流偏置机电学是实现量子级射频静电计和低噪声模块化异频链接的实用途径。

Abstract: We report a two-stage, heterodyne rf-to-microwave transducer that combines a
tunable electrostatic pre-amplifier with a superconducting electromechanical
cavity. A metalized Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane (3 MHz frequency) forms the movable
plate of a vacuum-gap capacitor in a microwave LC resonator. A dc bias across
the gap converts any small rf signal into a resonant electrostatic force
proportional to the bias, providing a voltage-controlled gain that multiplies
the cavity's intrinsic electromechanical gain. In a flip-chip device with a 1.5
$\mathrm{\mu}$m gap operated at 10 mK we observe dc-tunable anti-spring shifts,
and rf-to-microwave transduction at 49 V bias, achieving a charge sensitivity
of 87 $\mathrm{\mu}$e/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ (0.9 nV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$).
Extrapolation to sub-micron gaps and state-of-the-art $Q>10^8$ membrane
resonators predicts sub-200 fV/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity, establishing
dc-biased electromechanics as a practical route towards quantum-grade rf
electrometers and low-noise modular heterodyne links for superconducting
microwave circuits and charge or voltage sensing.

### [7] [Robustly self-testing all maximally entangled states in every finite dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01071)
*Uta Isabella Meyer,Ivan Šupić,Frédéric Grosshans,Damian Markham*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种设备无关、抗噪声的方法，用于认证任意有限维度d中的最大纠缠态。通过推广CHSH测试到高维系统，并利用Heisenberg-Weyl可观测量的非对角性质，实现了对高维纠缠态的自测试协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于开发一种适用于高维量子系统的设备无关认证方法，以验证最大纠缠态的存在，同时具备抗噪声能力。

Method: 方法包括推广CHSH测试到高维系统（qudits），利用Heisenberg-Weyl可观测量的非对角性质，构建Bell算子，并通过局部等距映射实现自测试。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法适用于高维系统，并可直接应用于光子和原子平台，为高维量子态的认证提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We establish a device-independent, noise-tolerant certification of maximally
entangled states in every finite dimension $d$. The core ingredient is a
$d$-input, $d$-outcome Bell experiment that generalizes the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt test from qubits to qudits, where each setting is a
non-diagonal Heisenberg-Weyl observable. For every odd prime $d \geq 3$, the
associated Bell operator has an exact sum-of-positive-operators decomposition,
yielding the Cirelson bound in closed form, from which we reconstruct the
Heisenberg-Weyl commutation relations on the support of the state. We then
extend the Mayers-Yao local isometry from qubits to prime-dimensional systems
and show that any $\epsilon$-near-optimal strategy below that bound is, up to
local isometries, within trace distance $\delta = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon})$
of the ideal maximally entangled state; the implemented measurements are
correspondingly close to the target observables. Via a tensor-factor argument,
the prime-dimension result extends the self-testing protocol to every composite
dimension $d$. The protocol uses standard Heisenberg-Weyl operations and
non-Clifford phase gates that are diagonal in the computational basis, making
it directly applicable to high-dimensional photonic and atomic platforms.

Conclusion: 该方法为研究非厄米量子多体系统提供了一种可扩展且灵活的计算工具，超越了传统数值技术的限制。

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems exhibit a rich array of physical
phenomena, including non-Hermitian skin effects and exceptional points, that
remain largely inaccessible to existing numerical techniques. In this work, we
investigate the application of variational Monte Carlo and neural network
wavefunction representations to examine their ground-state (the eigenstate with
the smallest real part energy) properties. Due to the breakdown of the
Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle in non-Hermitian settings, we develop a
self-consistent symmetric optimization framework based on variance minimization
with a dynamically updated energy estimate. Our approach respects the
biorthogonal structure of left and right eigenstates, and is further
strengthened by exploiting system symmetries and pseudo-Hermiticity. Tested on
a two-dimensional non-Hermitian transverse field Ising model endowed with a
complex longitudinal field, our method achieves high accuracy across both
parity-time symmetric and broken phases. Moreover, we propose novel
optimization routines that address the challenges posed by exceptional points
and provide reliable convergence to the ground state in regimes where standard
variational techniques fail. Lastly, we show, through extensive numerical
evidence, that our method offers a scalable and flexible computational tool to
investigate non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems, beyond the reach of
conventional numerical techniques such as the density-matrix renormalization
group algorithm.

### [9] [A causal derivation of the algebraic approach to quantum systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01111)
*Nick Ormrod*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文质疑量子系统必须由算子代数表示的传统假设，提出基于因果结构的“因果视角”，并证明其与传统代数表示的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑量子系统必须由算子代数表示的传统假设，探索更基础的表示方法。

Method: 借鉴量子理论中的因果建模框架，提出“因果视角”，并证明其与von Neumann代数的一致性。

Result: 证明每个量子系统对应唯一的von Neumann代数，并扩展定义“经典量子系统”与交换代数对应。

Conclusion: 因果视角与传统代数表示一致，但与“认知视角”不兼容，为量子系统表示提供了新思路。

Abstract: It is commonly assumed that every quantum system is represented by some
algebra of operators. Doubt is cast on this assumption by what appears, at
first glance, to be a reasonable candidate for a quantum system that is not
naturally represented by any algebra. To resolve this puzzle, this work draws
inspiration from recent frameworks for causal modelling in quantum theory to
propose a "causal view" of quantum systems. The causal view defines quantum
systems purely in terms of the causal structure of the unitary dynamics. The
algebraic representation of quantum systems is derived from the causal view: it
is proven that every quantum system corresponds to a unique von Neumann algebra
of operators. The causal view is extended with a definition of a "classical
quantum system" inspired by quantum Darwinism. It is shown that such a system
corresponds to a unique commutative von Neumann operator algebra, completing
the derivation of the traditional algebraic approach to quantum systems from
the causal view. The causal view is contrasted with the "epistemic view" of
quantum systems, which is incompatible with the algebraic approach.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: TensoMeta-VQC是一种基于张量链（TT）的元学习框架，旨在解决变分量子计算（VQC）的可扩展性和噪声敏感性问题，通过经典TT网络生成量子电路参数，显著提升VQC的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQC面临可扩展性障碍（如梯度消失和量子噪声敏感），需要一种新方法来提升其鲁棒性和实用性。

Method: 提出TensoMeta-VQC框架，利用经典TT网络生成量子电路参数，通过低秩结构化表示增强噪声鲁棒性和梯度传播效率。

Result: 理论分析证明了其近似能力、优化稳定性和泛化性能；实验在量子点分类、Max-Cut优化和分子量子模拟任务中表现出优越性能和噪声容忍性。

Conclusion: TensoMeta-VQC为近量子设备的实用化VQC提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental barriers in
scalability, primarily due to barren plateaus and quantum noise sensitivity. To
address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train
(TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and
scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation
of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling
optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates
gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank
representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on
Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical
analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization
stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across
quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum
simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior
performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway
toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.

### [11] [Quantum Algorithms for Gowers Norm Estimation, Polynomial Testing, and Arithmetic Progression Counting over Finite Abelian Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01231)
*En-Jui Kuo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一系列量子算法估计有限阿贝尔群上的Gowers均匀性范数$U^k$，应用于测试多项式结构和计数算术级数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展现有$U^2$-范数估计方法至更高$k$值及更广泛的群结构，以揭示高阶代数相关性。

Method: 通过量子态编码有限差分并应用傅里叶采样估计均匀性范数，结合振幅估计和逆定理。

Result: 针对特定$d=4,5,6$，提出准多项式时间量子算法区分相位多项式；开发基于$U^2$-范数的3项算术级数计数方法。

Conclusion: Gowers范数方法在噪声环境下仍有效，为量子性质测试和学习提供鲁棒性工具。

Abstract: We propose a family of quantum algorithms for estimating Gowers uniformity
norms $ U^k $ over finite abelian groups and demonstrate their applications to
testing polynomial structure and counting arithmetic progressions. Building on
recent work for estimating the $ U^2 $-norm over $ \mathbb{F}_2^n $, we
generalize the construction to arbitrary finite fields and abelian groups for
higher values of $ k $. Our algorithms prepare quantum states encoding finite
differences and apply Fourier sampling to estimate uniformity norms, enabling
efficient detection of structural correlations.
  As a key application, we show that for certain degrees $ d = 4, 5, 6 $ and
under appropriate conditions on the underlying field, there exist
quasipolynomial-time quantum algorithms that distinguish whether a bounded
function $ f(x) $ is a degree-$ d $ phase polynomial or far from any such
structure. These algorithms leverage recent inverse theorems for Gowers norms,
together with amplitude estimation, to reveal higher-order algebraic
correlations.
  We also develop a quantum method for estimating the number of 3-term
arithmetic progressions in Boolean functions $ f : \mathbb{F}_p^n \to \{0,1\}
$, based on estimating the $ U^2 $-norm. Though not as query-efficient as
Grover-based counting, our approach provides a structure-sensitive alternative
aligned with additive combinatorics.
  Finally, we demonstrate that our techniques remain valid under certain
quantum noise models, due to the shift-invariance of Gowers norms. This enables
noise-resilient implementations within the NISQ regime and suggests that
Gowers-norm-based quantum algorithms may serve as robust primitives for quantum
property testing, learning, and pseudorandomness.

TL;DR: 论文展示了通过原位沉积Al₂O₃保护的钽和铝薄膜微带谐振器，具有长期稳定性，内部品质因子（Qi）超过一百万，且在空气中暴露14个月后性能几乎无下降。

Motivation: 超导微波谐振器的长期稳定性对可扩展量子技术至关重要，但表面和界面降解限制了其稳定性。

Method: 使用外延钽和铝薄膜制备微带谐振器，并通过原位沉积Al₂O₃保护，在超高真空条件下实现。

Conclusion: 原位Al₂O₃保护提供了一种稳健、可扩展的钝化策略，解决了超导量子电路发展中的材料挑战。

Abstract: Long-term stability of superconducting microwave resonators is essential for
scalable quantum technologies; however, surface and interface degradation
continue to limit device stability. Here, we demonstrate exceptional stability
in microstrip resonators fabricated from epitaxial tantalum and aluminum films,
protected by in situ deposited Al$_2$O$_3$ under ultra-high vacuum. These
resonators initially exhibit internal quality factors (Qi) exceeding one
million and maintain high performance with minimal degradation after up to
fourteen months of air exposure. In contrast, devices relying on native surface
oxides show substantial declines in Qi over time, indicating increased
microwave losses. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the in situ
Al$_2$O$_3$ effectively suppresses interfacial oxidation and preserves the
chemical integrity of the underlying superconducting films, whereas native
oxides permit progressive oxidation, leading to device degradation. These
findings establish a robust, scalable passivation strategy that addresses a
longstanding materials challenge in the development of superconducting quantum
circuits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子最优控制在量子技术中至关重要，特别是在量子计算中快速准确的门设计和实现。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在保持高精度的同时，计算效率优于CRAB和GRAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且可扩展的量子门合成方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Quantum optimal control plays a crucial role in the development of quantum
technologies, particularly in the design and implementation of fast and
accurate gates for quantum computing. Here, we present a method to synthesize
gates using the Magnus expansion. In particular, we formulate a polynomial
optimization problem that allows us to find the global solution without
resorting to approximations of the exponential. The global method we use
provides a certificate of globality and lets us do single-shot optimization,
which implies it is generally faster than local methods. By optimizing over
Hermitian matrices generating the unitaries, instead of the unitaries
themselves, we can reduce the size of the polynomial to optimize, leading to
faster convergence and better scalability, compared to the QCPOP method.
Numerical experiments comparing our results with CRAB and GRAPE show that we
maintain high accuracy of QCPOP, while improving computational efficiency.

Abstract: The classical limit of quantum mechanics is investigated, by focusing on the
study of the center of mass of a many-body system where each particle is
described by quantum mechanics. We study how, in the limit when the number of
particles diverges and under quite general assumptions, the center of mass of
the system is not anymore described by quantum mechanics but by classical
mechanics: the center of mass of the system becomes with a well-defined
position and momentum, the state of the center of mass is fully determined by
its position and by its momentum, and its dynamics is given by the classical
law of dynamics. In order to get this result, three assumptions on the
many-body system are necessary: the total mass of the system must be much
larger than the mass of each particle composing the system; at most a finite
number of particles has non-zero correlation in position with an infinite
number of particles; finally, when the number of particles composing the system
diverge, the variance in position of each particle converges to a finite value.
These assumptions are commonly realized for a macroscopic solid and liquid
systems. Finally, we sketch a possible experimental setup aiming at observing
the quantum-to-classical transition of the center of mass of a massive
many-body system. The results obtained in this paper show how the classical
limit of quantum mechanics can be naturally achieved without the need to modify
quantum mechanics, without the need to have an external environment and without
the need of changing the interpretations of quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Elastic electron scattering is one of the primary means of investigating
materials on the atomic scale. It is usually described by modeling the sample
as a fixed, static, perturbative potential, thereby completely neglecting the
quantum nature of the atoms inside. In this work, we present a quantum
treatment of elastic electron scattering. We show that the interaction of the
probe beam and the sample results in entanglement between the two systems,
which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly on coherence and image
contrast. As a timely example, we discuss decoherence in Bragg scattering on
nanoparticles. We also investigate under which conditions the conventional
scattering theory is recovered.

Method: 利用傅里叶域分析，评估压缩输入光对机械条件态中光学噪声的减少效果，并通过信噪比（SNR）估计GIE测量中的系统与统计误差。

Result: 使用压缩输入光时，总测量时间需10^6秒达到SNR=1，而未使用时需10^{6.8}秒，表明压缩光显著提升GIE可检测性。

Conclusion: 光机械系统及压缩输入光在增强GIE检测中具有关键作用。

Abstract: We investigate the advantage of using squeezed input light for generating
gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) through Fourier-domain analysis. Based on
the findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in
optomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that
squeezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional
state and enhance GIE. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical
errors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite
measurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s
is required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8}
s is needed without squeezed input light. This result highlights the
effectiveness of optomechanical systems and the critical role of squeezed input
light in enhancing the detectability of GIE.

Abstract: The Markov length was recently proposed as an information-theoretic
diagnostic for quantum mixed-state phase transitions [Sang & Hsieh, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 134, 070403 (2025)]. Here, we show that the Markov length diverges even
under classical stochastic dynamics, when a low-temperature ordered state is
quenched into the high temperature phase. Conventional observables do not
exhibit growing length scales upon quenching into the high-temperature phase;
however, the Markov length grows exponentially in time. Consequently, the state
of a system as it heats becomes increasingly non-Gibbsian, and the range of its
putative "parent Hamiltonian" must diverge with the Markov length. From this
information-theoretic point of view the late-time limit of thermalization is
singular. We introduce a numerical technique for computing the Markov length
based on matrix-product states, and explore its dynamics under general thermal
quenches in the one-dimensional classical Ising model. For all cases, we
provide simple information-theoretic arguments that explain our results.

Abstract: The realization of long-distance quantum communication and the envisioned
quantum internet relies on coherent hybrid light-matter interfaces connecting
quantum light emitters with quantum memory (QM) systems. Unlike probabilistic
photon pair sources such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion,
deterministic quantum light emitters enable the on-demand production of pure
and bright single and entangled photons, essential for scalable quantum
networks. In this work, we present the first experimental realization of a
coherent hybrid light-matter interface between a chip-integrated InAsP/InP
nanowire quantum dot (QD) and a solid-state QM based on Er$^{3+}$ ions doped in
a glass silica fiber (erbium-doped fiber, EDF). The emission spectrum of the
InAsP/InP nanowire QD aligns with the absorption bandwidth of the EDF at 980 nm
at cryogenic temperatures, allowing efficient interaction between the two
systems. To demonstrate this, we present a spectroscopic characterization of
the $^{4}I_{15/2} \leftrightarrow ^{4}I_{11/2}$ optical transition in EDF at
980 nm. Our measurements reveal substantial inhomogeneous broadening of this
optical transition and a long spin population lifetime, underscoring EDFs
potential for broadband QM implementation. We implement an 8 GHz bandwidth
multimode QM based on the Atomic Frequency Comb protocol, enabling the storage
and retrieval of 59 weak coherent pulses. Furthermore, we characterize
single-photon emission from an InAsP/InP nanowire QD at 980 nm and demonstrate
its deterministic storage and recall in the EDF QM. Notably, this is achieved
without spectral tuning of the QD emission, demonstrating its direct
compatibility with a solid-state QM.

Abstract: Recent developments in quantum technologies have enabled significant
improvements in the precision of optical sensing systems. This work explores
the integration of distributed quantum sensing (DQS) with optical gyroscopes to
improve the estimation accuracy of angular velocity. Utilizing bright two-mode
squeezed states (bTMSS), which offer high photon numbers and strong bipartite
quantum correlations, we propose a novel configuration that leverages
continuous-variable entanglement across multiple spatially separated optical
gyroscopes. Unlike traditional quantum sensing that enhances a single sensor,
our approach focuses on estimating a global phase shift corresponding to the
average angular rotation across distributed optical gyroscopes with
quantum-enhanced sensitivity. We analyze the phase sensitivities of different
bTMSS configurations, including M mode-entangled bTMSS and separable M-bTMSS,
and evaluate their performance through the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. The
analysis shows that, with 5% photon loss in every channel in the system, the
proposed scheme shows a sensitivity enhancement of ~9.3 dB beyond the
shot-noise limit, with an initial squeezing of ~9.8 dB. The present scheme has
potential applications in quantum-enhanced inertial navigation and precision
metrology within emerging quantum networks.

Abstract: Optical tomograms can be envisaged as patterns. The Wasserstein generative
adversarial network (WGAN) algorithm provides a platform to train the machine
to compare patterns corresponding to input and generated tomograms. Using a
deep-learning framework with two convolutional neural networks and WGAN, we
have trained the machine to generate tomograms of Fock states, coherent states
(CS) and the single photon added CS ($1$-PACS). The training process was
continued until the Wasserstein distance between the input and output
tomographic patterns levelled off at a low value. The mean photon number,
variances and higher moments were extracted directly from the generated
tomograms, to distinguish between different Fock states and also between the CS
and the $1$-PACS, without using an additional classifier neural network. The
robustness of our results has been verified using two error models and also
with different colormaps that define the tomographic patterns. We have examined
if the training program successfully reflected some of the findings in a recent
experiment in which state reconstruction was carried out to establish that the
fidelities between an amplified CS, an optimal CS and a $1$-PACS were close to
unity, over a range of parameter values. By training the machine to reproduce
tomograms corresponding to these specific states, and comparing the mean photon
numbers of these states obtained directly from the tomograms, we have
established that the variations in these observables reflect the experimental
trends. State reconstruction from tomograms could be challenging, in general,
since the Hilbert space associated with quantized light is large. The
tomographic approach provides a viable alternative to detailed state
reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to generate
optical tomograms from which the states can be directly characterized.

Abstract: Algebras with given (anti-)commutativity structure are widespread in quantum
mechanics. This structure is captured by quasi-Clifford algebras (QCA): a QCA
generated by $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n$ is is given by the relations
$\alpha_i^2 = k_i$ and $\alpha_j \alpha_i = (-1)^{\chi_{ij}} \alpha_i
\alpha_j$, where $k_i \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\chi_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}$. We present
a mapping from QCA to Pauli algebras and discuss its use in quantum information
and computation. The mapping also provides a Wedderburn decomposition of matrix
groups with quasi-Clifford structure. This provides a block-diagonalization for
e.g. Pauli groups, while for Majorana operators the Jordan-Wigner transform is
recovered. Applications to the symmetry reduction of semidefinite programs and
for constructing maximal anti-commuting subsets are discussed.

Abstract: Optical frequency combs, named for their comb-like peaks in the spectrum, are
essential for various sensing applications. As the technology develops, its
performance has reached the standard quantum limit dictated by the quantum
fluctuations of coherent light field. Quantum combs, with their quantum
fluctuation engineered via squeezing and entanglement, are the necessary
ingredient for overcoming such limits. We develop the theory for designing and
analyzing quantum combs, focusing on dual-comb interferometric measurement. Our
analyses cover both squeezed and entangled quantum combs with division
receivers and heterodyne receivers, leading to four protocols with quantum
advantages scalable with squeezing/entanglement strength. In the spectroscopy
of a single absorption line, whereas the division receiver with the squeezed
comb suffers from amplified thermal noise, the other three protocols
demonstrate a surprising robustness to loss at a few comb lines. Such a unique
loss-robustness of a scalable quantum advantage has not been found in any
traditional quantum sensing protocols.

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly growing area that applies
techniques from algebraic topology to extract robust features from large-scale
data. A key task in TDA is the estimation of (normalized) Betti numbers, which
capture essential topological invariants. While recent work has led to quantum
algorithms for this problem, we explore an alternative direction: combining
classical and quantum resources to estimate the Betti numbers of a simplicial
complex more efficiently. Assuming the classical description of a simplicial
complex, that is, its set of vertices and edges, we propose a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm. The classical component enumerates all simplices,
and this combinatorial structure is subsequently processed by a quantum
algorithm to estimate the Betti numbers. We analyze the performance of our
approach and identify regimes where it potentially achieves polynomial to
exponential speedups over existing quantum methods, at the trade-off of using
more ancilla qubits. We further demonstrate the utility of normalized Betti
numbers in concrete applications, highlighting the broader potential of hybrid
quantum algorithms in topological data analysis.

Conclusion: 压缩光对ATI过程的影响揭示了光与物质相互作用的非经典特性，为量子光学和强场物理提供了新见解。

Abstract: Above-threshold ionization (ATI) is a strong-field-driven process where
electrons absorb more photons than required for ionization. While ATI dynamics
and outputs are well-understood when driven by classical, perfectly coherent
light, the recent development of non-classical light sources for strong-field
phenomena has spurred interest in their effect on the involved electron
dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic quantum optical theory
describing ATI under the influence of strong squeezed light. We observe that
squeezed light significantly enhances the coupling between light and matter,
making their mutual backaction more important than under classical driving.
This backaction profoundly impacts the electronic ionization times, as well as
the non-classical properties of the joint electron-light state. This results in
pronounced entanglement features, both immediately after ionization, and at
later times. These entanglement features are reflected in the properties of the
quantum optical state of the driving field revealing notable non-Gaussian
features that depend on both, the amount of squeezing, and the number of
ionization events occurring during the interaction.

Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of dynamical quantum phase transitions
(QPTs) in a periodically driven $\Lambda$-type three-level system (3LS)
embedded in a double-mode cavity, described by a three-level Jaynes-Cumming
(3L-JC) Hamiltonian. To begin with, we probe the undriven static Hamiltonian in
the dressed-state basis to identify and define distinct coupling regimes and
critical points associated with both cavity modes. Furthermore, to investigate
the dynamical QPTs in this system, we incorporate a periodic modulation across
two atomic states (denoted by $|3\rangle_{at}$ and $|2\rangle_{at}$) out of the
three available energy levels. By performing necessary transformations and
approximations, we reduce the overall Hamiltonian, which contains static and
dynamic modulation terms, into an effective 3L-JC Hamiltonian whose system
parameters are dependent on the driving parameters. The validity of our
approximations is verified using the Loschmidt echo of time-evolved states
corresponding to Hamiltonians before and after the approximations. Finally, we
demonstrate that by tuning the modulation parameters, it is possible to explore
bimodal superradiant phases in a three-level $\Lambda$-type system while
remaining within the critical coupling limits of the static Hamiltonian. Our
results provide an insight into the manipulation of quantum phases in a
three-level system within an effective extended Jaynes-Cummings regime.

Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing that
has attracted considerable interest owing to its potential to efficiently solve
the governing equations of large-scale classical systems. Exponential speedup
through Hamiltonian simulation has been rigorously demonstrated in the case of
coupled harmonic oscillators. The question arises as to whether Hamiltonian
simulations in other physical systems also accelerate exponentially.
Schr\"odingerization is a technique that transforms the governing equations of
classical systems into the Schr\"odinger equation. However, since the
Schr\"odinger equation is a linear equation, Hamiltonian simulation is often
limited to linear equations. The research on Hamiltonian simulation methods for
nonlinear governing equations remains relatively limited. In this study, we
propose a Hamiltonian simulation method for nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs). The proposed method is named Carleman linearization +
Schr\"odingerization (CLS), which combines Carleman linearization (CL) and
warped phase transformation (WPT). CL is first applied to transform a nonlinear
PDE into a linear differential equation. This linearized equation is then
mapped to the Schr\"odinger equation via WPT. The original nonlinear PDE can be
solved efficiently by the Hamiltonian simulation of the resulting Schr\"odinger
equation. By applying this method, we transform the original governing equation
into the Schr\"odinger equation. Solving the transformed Schr\"odinger equation
then enables the analysis of the original nonlinear equation. As a specific
application, we apply this method to the nonlinear reaction--diffusion equation
to demonstrate that Hamiltonian simulations are applicable to nonlinear PDEs.

offline policy search was applied, in which a pure VQC with trainable
input-output weights is used as a policy network instead of a classical
multilayer perceptron. The goal is to evaluate the potential of deploying
quantum architectures in real-world industrial control problems. The
experimental results show that the investigated model-based offline policy
search is able to generate quantum policies that can balance the hardware
cart-pole. A latency analysis reveals that while local simulated execution
meets real-time requirements, cloud-based quantum processing remains too slow
for closed-loop control.

Conclusion: OAM结构光为相对论条件下的新型测量技术提供了有效资源。

Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) as both classical and quantum states of light
has proven essential in numerous applications, from high-capacity information
transfer to enhanced precision and accuracy in metrology. Here, we extend OAM
metrology to relativistic scenarios to determine the Lorentz factor of a moving
reference frame, exploiting the fact that OAM is not Lorentz invariant. Using
OAM correlations of entangled states, we show that their joint OAM spectrum is
modified by length contraction, where the rescaling of spatial dimensions
alters the orthogonality of the OAM modes themselves. In an emulated
experiment, we confirm the predicted broadening of the OAM spectrum and use
this to quantitatively infer the Lorentz (contraction) factor, reaching
experimentally simulated velocities of up to 0.99c. Our work provides a pathway
for novel measurement techniques suitable for relativistic conditions that
leverages OAM structured light as a resource.

Result: 数值模拟验证了IPMP方法的收敛性、稳定性和正则化效果，单重态产率变化小于1%。

Conclusion: 结果为量子生物现象的实验研究提供了新途径。

Abstract: This paper aims at devising the shape of the external electromagnetic field
which drives the spin dynamics of radical pairs to quantum coherent state
through maximization of the triplet-singlet yield in biochemical reactions. The
model is a Schr\"{o}dinger system with spin Hamiltonians given by the sum of
Zeeman interaction and hyperfine coupling interaction terms. We introduce a
one-parameter family of optimal control problems by coupling the
Schr\"{o}dinger system to a control field through filtering equations for the
electromagnetic field. Fr\'echet differentiability and the Pontryagin Maximum
Principle in Hilbert space is proved, and the bang-bang structure of the
optimal control is established. A new iterative Pontryagin Maximum Principle
(IPMP) method for the identification of the bang-bang optimal control is
developed. Numerical simulations based on IPMP and the gradient projection
method (GPM) in Hilbert spaces are pursued, and the convergence, stability and
the regularization effect are demonstrated. Comparative analysis of filtering
with regular optimal electromagnetic field versus non-filtering with bang-bang
optimal field ({\it Abdulla et al, Quantum Sci. Technol., {\bf9}, 4, 2024})
demonstrates the change of the maxima of the singlet yield is less than 1\%.
The results open a venue for a potential experimental work for the
magnetoreception as a manifestation of quantum biological phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在分布式量子存储器中高效执行量子纠错，同时简化连接方式。

Method: 采用2×L模块阵列，第一行存储逻辑信息，第二行使用循环移位进行量子纠错。提出了两种纠错策略：适用于所有稳定子码的循环布局和专用于BB码的稀疏循环布局。

Result: 对于[[144,12,12]] BB码，稀疏循环布局实现了12个逻辑量子比特分布在12个模块中，每个模块12个物理量子比特。物理实现展示了低逻辑错误率（<2×10^-6，物理错误率为10^-3）。

Conclusion: 该架构通过循环移位简化了分布式量子存储器的实现，同时保持了量子LDPC码的性能。

Abstract: We propose an architecture for a quantum memory distributed over a $2 \times
L$ array of modules equipped with a cyclic shift implemented via flying qubits.
The logical information is distributed across the first row of $L$ modules and
quantum error correction is executed using ancilla modules on the second row
equipped with a cyclic shift. This work proves that quantum LDPC codes such as
BB codes can maintain their performance in a distributed setting while using
solely one simple connector: a cyclic shift. We propose two strategies to
perform quantum error correction on a $2 \times L$ module array: (i) The cyclic
layout which applies to any stabilizer codes, whereas previous results for
qubit arrays are limited to CSS codes. (ii) The sparse cyclic layout, specific
to bivariate bicycle (BB) codes. For the $[[144,12,12]]$ BB code, using the
sparse cyclic layout we obtain a quantum memory with $12$ logical qubits
distributed over $12$ modules, containing $12$ physical qubits each. We propose
physical implementations of this architecture using flying qubits, that can be
faithfully transported, and include qubits encoded in ions, neutral atoms,
electrons or photons. We performed numerical simulations when modules are long
ion chains and when modules are single-qubit arrays of ions showing that the
distributed BB code achieves a logical error rate below $2 \cdot 10^{-6}$ when
the physical error rate is $10^{-3}$.

Conclusion: 强调了提升比特质量对维持量子优势的重要性。

Abstract: We analytically investigated the robustness of the Bernstein--Vazirani
algorithm in the presence of depolarizing noise using the density matrix
formalism. We derive exact expressions for the algorithm's success probability
as a function of the depolarizing error rate $\boldsymbol{p}$ and number of
qubits $\boldsymbol{n}$. The analysis reveals how performance degrades with
increasing system size under realistic noise conditions. Furthermore, it was
seen that scaling up quantum systems without simultaneously improving qubit
quality leads to a sharp decline in the quantum advantage for this algorithm.

Result: BVQC显著降低了PPA变化（9.89e-3）和GTD（0.089），优于现有水印技术。

Conclusion: BVQC是一种高效、鲁棒的VQC水印技术，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a powerful quantum
computing paradigm, demonstrating a scaling advantage for problems intractable
for classical computation. As VQCs require substantial resources and
specialized expertise for their design, they represent significant intellectual
properties (IPs). However, existing quantum circuit watermarking techniques
suffer from two primary drawbacks: (1) watermarks can be removed during
re-compilation of the circuits, and (2) these methods significantly increase
task loss due to the extensive length of the inserted watermarks across
multiple compilation stages. To address these challenges, we propose BVQC, a
backdoor-based watermarking technique for VQCs that preserves the original loss
in typical execution settings, while deliberately increasing the loss to a
predefined level during watermark extraction. Additionally, BVQC employs a
grouping algorithm to minimize the watermark task's interference with the base
task, ensuring optimal accuracy for the base task. BVQC retains the original
compilation workflow, ensuring robustness against re-compilation. Our
evaluations show that BVQC greatly reduces Probabilistic Proof of Authorship
(PPA) changes by 9.89e-3 and ground truth distance (GTD) by 0.089 compared to
prior watermarking technologies.

Motivation: 传统边带冷却方法需要多次循环才能达到基态，效率较低。本文旨在通过简并耦合提高冷却效率。

Method: 利用双光子拉曼跃迁耦合相邻塞曼态（|F,mF⟩→|F,mF−1⟩），单次循环可移除多个运动量子。

Result: 在176Lu+离子中，初始平均声子数为6时，仅需约10个脉冲即可实现近基态冷却。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任何F能级，显著提高了冷却效率，为实验提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We explore degenerate Raman sideband cooling in which neighboring Zeeman
states of a fixed hyperfine level are coupled via a two-photon Raman
transition. The degenerate coupling between $|F,m_F\rangle\rightarrow
|F,m_F-1\rangle$ facilitates the removal of multiple motional quanta in a
single cycle. This method greatly reduces the number of cooling cycles required
to reach the ground state compared to traditional sideband cooling. We show
that near ground state cooling can be achieved with a pulse number as low as
$\bar{n}$ where $\bar{n}$ is the average phonon number in the initial thermal
state. We demonstrate proof-of-concept in $^{176}\mathrm{Lu}^+$ by coupling
neighboring Zeeman levels on the motional sideband for the $F=7$ hyperfine
level in $^3D_1$. Starting from a thermal distribution with an average phonon
number of 6, we demonstrate near ground-state cooling with $\sim10$ pulses. A
theoretical description is given that applies to any $F$ level and demonstrates
how effective this approach can be.

Abstract: Uncertainty relations are pivotal in delineating the limits of simultaneous

and reverse uncertainty relations for the sum of variances of two incompatible
observables, leveraging the mathematical framework of the Maligranda
inequality. These relations are shown to provide tighter bounds than several
well-known existing relations. Furthermore, we extend these results to
multi-observable scenarios by employing an inequality from M. Kato et al.,
deriving generalized uncertainty relations that similarly exhibit enhanced
precision. The incorporation of the phase angle of the measurement state
contributes to strengthening the derived inequalities. Comparative analyses
with prior studies confirm the effectiveness of our inequalities in
two-observable systems via three illustrative examples.

Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid quantum approach for graph-based semi-supervised
learning to enhance performance in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. We
introduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation
strategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR
decomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby
enabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods
across four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German
Credit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform
leading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under
limited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect
of circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement
entropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB). Our results suggest that while some
level of entanglement improves the model's ability to generalize, increased
circuit complexity may introduce noise that undermines performance on current
quantum hardware. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
quantum-enhanced models for semi-supervised learning, offering practical
insights into how quantum circuits can be designed to balance expressivity and
stability. These findings support the role of quantum machine learning in
advancing data-efficient classification, especially in applications constrained
by label availability and hardware limitations.

Abstract: Distributed quantum sensing, which estimates a global parameter across
distant nodes, has attracted significant interest for applications such as
quantum imaging, sensor networks, and global-scale clock synchronization.
$N00N$ states are regarded as one of the optimal quantum resources for quantum
metrology, enabling the Heisenberg scaling. Recently, the concept of $N00N$
states has been extended to multi-mode $N00N$ states for quantum-enhanced
multiple-parameter estimation. However, the application of multi-mode $N00N$
states in distributed quantum sensing remains unexplored. Here, we propose a
distributed quantum sensing scheme that achieves the Heisenberg scaling using
multi-mode $N00N$ states. We theoretically show that multi-mode $N00N$ states
can reach the Heisenberg scaling by examining both the Cram\'er-Rao bound and
the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. For experimental demonstration, we employ a
four-mode $2002$ state to estimate the average of two spatially distributed
phases, achieving a 2.74 dB sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum
limit. We believe that utilizing multi-mode $N00N$ states for distributed
quantum sensing offers a promising approach for developing
entanglement-enhanced sensor networks.

Method: 本文通过分析第一个模拟量子算法（用于计算马尔可夫链的稳态分布）的实际适用性，类似于Aaronson对HHL算法的研究。

Result: 研究发现，量子算法的实际适用性需要更多关注，无论是通过单独的研究方向，还是在算法介绍时给予更多重视。

Conclusion: 结论指出，应更多关注量子算法的实际适用性，以推动其在实际中的应用。

Abstract: With a growing interest in quantum computing, the number of proposed quantum
algorithms grows as well. The practical applicability of these algorithms
differs: Some can be applied out-of-the-box, while others require black box
oracles, which can not always be easily implemented. One of the first works to
explicitly discuss these practical applicability aspects is by Aaronson
discussing the \textit{fine print} of the HHL quantum algorithm that solves
linear systems of equations. We extend this line of research by providing a
similar fine print for the first analog quantum algorithm that computes the
stationary distribution of Markov chains. We conclude that more focus should be
put on this practical applicability of quantum algorithms, either through a
separate line of research, or through more attention when introducing the
algorithm.

Abstract: The use of C-band wavelengths in the field of quantum communication has grown
significantly, driving the need for versatile detection solutions, especially
in the low intensity domain. Among the desirable features for such detectors,
photon-number-resolving (PNR) capability is particularly valuable, since it can
offer new possibilities for enhancing security of communication protocols. In
this paper, we present the implementation of a receiver that combines low-cost
PNR detectors with nonlinear optical interactions to achieve sensitivity at
telecom wavelengths. Specifically, we use this receiver to characterize the
Poissonian nature of a femtosecond source at 1.5 $\mu$m, produced via white
light continuum generation followed by a single-stage amplification process.
The obtained results encourage the exploitation of such a detector in more

Result: 通过数值优化计算密钥率，证明该协议在通信距离上优于现有协议。

Conclusion: 提出的协议在实验可行性和通信距离上具有优势，为长距离DI-QKD提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) enables
information-theoretically secure key distribution between remote parties
without any assumptions on the internal workings of the devices used for its
implementation. However, its communication distance is strictly limited since
the loophole-free Bell violation is required to guarantee its security.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose two long-distance DI-QKD protocols which
use a heralding scheme based on single-photon interference. Our protocols
consist of only standard quantum optics tools such as two-mode squeezed states,
displacement operations and on-off detectors, making the experimental
implementation feasible with current technology. We employ a classical
postprocessing method to enhance our protocols' robustness against experimental
imperfections. We calculate key rates of the protocols by numerical
optimization and show the supremacy of this implementation over existing
protocols in terms of communication distances.

Abstract: Bargmann invariants, multivariate traces of states, completely characterize
any unitary-invariant property of a set of states. Unitary invariants enable
the description of quantum resources such as basis-independent coherence and
imaginarity, nonstabilizerness, and contextuality. We show that the quantum
switch, a higher-order process featuring indefinite causal order, can be used
to measure Bargmann invariants of arbitrary order. We also show how simple
Hadamard test circuits can deterministically simulate an arbitrary unitary
quantum switch. Our results establish a solid bridge between the theory and
applications of unitary invariants and higher-order maps in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Heat transfer is a fundamental concept in physics, and how to characterize
the microscopical physical mechanism of heat transfer is a significant topic.
Recently, a new mechanism for heat transfer, phonon heat transfer across a
vacuum through quantum fluctuations, has been experimentally demonstrated in a
two-vibrating-membrane system. However, a microscopic quantum electrodynamics
theory behind this phenomenon remains unexplored. Here, we establish the
nonrelativistic microscopic theory of phonon heat transfer across a vacuum
confined by two movable end mirrors of a one-dimensional optomechanical cavity.
Under the multimode-cavity-field framework, we obtain a second-order effective
Hamiltonian governing the heat transfer effect. This Hamiltonian describes a
phonon-exchange interaction between the two mirrors with a strength
proportional to a multimode factor and $l_{0}^{-3}$, where $l_{0}$ is the rest
cavity length. We also confirm the dependence of the mode temperatures and heat
flux on the rest cavity length, corresponding to the thermal steady state of
the mirrors. This work initiates the microscopic investigation of
thermodynamics based on the optomechanical cavity platform, and will have
profound implications for both thermal management in nanoscale devices and
cavity optomechanics.

Abstract: Quantum heuristics have shown promise in solving various optimization
problems, including lattice protein folding. Equally relevant is the inverse
problem, protein design, where one seeks sequences that fold to a given target
structure. The latter problem is often split into two steps: (i) searching for
sequences that minimize the energy in the target structure, and (ii) testing
whether the generated sequences fold to the desired structure. Here, we
investigate the utility of variational quantum algorithms for the first of
these two steps on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We focus
on the sequence optimization task, which is less resource-demanding than
folding computations. We test the quantum approximate optimization algorithm
and variants of it, with problem-informed quantum circuits, as well as the
hardware-efficient ansatz, with problem-agnostic quantum circuits. While the
former algorithms yield acceptable results in noiseless simulations, their
performance drops under noise. With the problem-agnostic circuits, which are
more compatible with hardware constraints, an improved performance is observed
in both noisy and noiseless simulations. However, the results deteriorate when
running on a real quantum device. We attribute this discrepancy to features not
captured by the simulated noise model, such as the temporal aspect of the
hardware noise.

Abstract: For two non-communicating parties, quantum theory can give rise to
probability distributions of outcomes that cannot be reproduced by any local
classical model without communication. However, in the case of two-dimensional
systems ($d=2$), it is known that allowing a finite amount of classical
communication to shared classical resources makes it possible to simulate these
quantum correlations. Whether such a simulation remains possible in higher
dimensions is still an open question. In this work, we identify the key
features of the exact classical protocol in $d=2$, and use them to construct
robust approximate protocols in higher dimensions. We assess their performance

approach exactly reproduces the quantum probability distributions for $d=2$,

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence hinges on the integrity of its
training data, a foundation often compromised by noise and corruption. Here,
through a comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on both
classical and quantum data, we reveal a fundamental difference in their
response to data corruption. We find that classical models exhibit brittle
memorization, leading to a failure in generalization. In contrast, quantum
models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase
transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point
beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further
establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process
of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show
that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories
of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum
model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate
unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can
possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability,
providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial
intelligence of the future.

Conclusion: 该工作为通过光子链路互联的可扩展超导量子网络提供了关键设计指导。

Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a leading platform for implementing
practical quantum computation algorithms. Although superconducting quantum
processors with hundreds of qubits have been demonstrated, their further
scaling up is constrained by the physical size and cooling power of dilution
refrigerators. This constraint can be overcome by constructing a quantum
network to interconnect qubits hosted in different refrigerators, which
requires microwave-to-optical transducers to enable low-loss signal
transmission over long distances. Despite that various designs and
demonstrations have achieved high-efficiency and low-added-noise transducers, a
coherent photonic link between separate refrigerators has not yet been
realized. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate coherent signal transfer
between two superconducting circuits housed in separate dilution refrigerators,
enabled by a pair of frequency-matched aluminum nitride electro-optic
transducers connected via a 1-km telecom optical fiber. With transducers at
each node achieving >0.1% efficiency, an overall 80 dB improvement in
transduction efficiency over commercial electro-optic modulators is attainable,
paving the way towards a fully quantum-enabled link. This work provides
critical design guidelines towards scalable superconducting quantum networks
interconnected by photonic links.

Motivation: 量子神经网络（QNNs）因缺乏非线性操作和贫瘠高原现象而难以实际应用，需解决这些问题以实现可扩展的量子深度学习。

Method: 采用正交基展开引入非线性，直接参数化酉矩阵避免贫瘠高原，并引入量子卷积核和步长以实现可扩展电路。

Conclusion: 该架构成功将经典卷积机制融入量子框架，为实用且表达能力强的QNNs奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) leverage quantum entanglement and
superposition to enable large-scale parallel linear computation, offering a
potential solution to the scalability limits of classical deep learning.
However, their practical deployment is hampered by two key challenges: the lack
of intrinsic nonlinear operations and the barren plateau phenomenon. We propose
a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) architecture that simultaneously
addresses both issues. Nonlinear effects are introduced via orthonormal basis
expansions of power series, while barren plateaus are mitigated by directly
parameterizing unitary matrices rather than stacking multiple parameterized
gates. Our design further incorporates quantum analogs of convolutional kernels
and strides for scalable circuit construction. Experiments on MNIST and
Fashion-MNIST datasets achieve 99.0% and 88.0% test accuracy, respectively.
Consistency between PyTorch-based matrix simulation and Qiskit-based quantum
circuit simulation validates the physical fidelity of the model. These results
demonstrate a flexible and effective quantum architecture that faithfully
integrates classical convolutional mechanisms into a quantum framework, paving
the way for practical and expressive QNNs.

Result: 证明了MTS与时间标记P-CTC辅助梳的操作等价性，并探讨了资源理论视角。

Conclusion: 建立了时间对称性与循环因果性的操作等价性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between the time-symmetric nature of physical
laws and the apparent directionality of causality is a central question in
quantum foundations. The standard operational formulation, widely used in
quantum information, imposes a definite, acyclic causal order on agents'
operations, contrasting with time-symmetric dynamics. Two prominent extensions
of this framework are the multi-time state (MTS) formalism, which incorporates
time symmetry via arbitrary pre- and post-selection, and the post-selected
closed timelike curve (P-CTC) framework, which enables cyclic causal influences
through post-selection on maximally entangled states. While prior work has
noted structural connections between MTS and P-CTCs, it remained unclear
whether an operational equivalence exists, or whether constructive mappings can
be established between their most general objects. In this work, we address
this gap by extending the P-CTC framework to define time-labelled P-CTC
assisted combs, a more general class of P-CTC-assisted objects that support
open processing slots and explicit temporal structure. We prove that for every
(possibly mixed) MTS, there exists an operationally equivalent time-labelled
P-CTC-assisted comb, and vice versa. The equivalence is shown via explicit
mappings, while discussing the number and dimensionality of the P-CTCs
involved. We also explore a resource-theoretic view of MTS, defining a partial
order under free transformations that do not use P-CTCs. We conclude by
discussing future directions informed by the operational equivalence between
time symmetry and cyclic causality established here.

Conclusion: 提出了一种利用量子并行性高效探测这些模式的实验方案。

Abstract: We theoretically consider the quantum simulation of a spin Hamiltonian whose
twelve sites are arranged in a planar configuration with high spatial symmetry,
$D_{6h}$. We map the system onto an effective fermionic Hamiltonian and
identify its symmetry group. Comparing different initial states evolving under
the Heisenberg or XXZ Hamiltonians, we analyze the impact of symmetry on the
probability distribution for the outcomes of a measurement in a given basis, as
a function of the evolution time. The considered measurement basis resolves
only a part of the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We show that, for suitable
choices of the initial state, unresolved symmetries make some configurations
equiprobable. We identify four different regimes for the time evolution of the
probabilities: these may be constant, vary sinusoidally in time, evolve
aperiodically, or collapse. We propose an experimentally accessible scheme
which exploits quantum parallelism to probe these regimes efficiently.

Abstract: A stepped-impedance low-pass filter with integrated hollow waveguide
absorbers is presented. The filter combines low insertion loss in the passband
with strong attenuation at high frequencies, making it well suited for
superconducting quantum computing applications, where qubits are sensitive to
both near-band and far out-of-band radiation. The structure is implemented in a
rectangular coaxial geometry, with inductive sections coupled to circular
hollow waveguides oriented orthogonally to the transmission axis. Above their
cutoff frequency, these waveguides efficiently couple to radiation inside the
stepped-impedance filter, absorbing energy that would otherwise cause Cooper
pair breaking in conventional superconductors. Optimal dimensions were obtained
using a differential evolution algorithm applied to interpolated
electromagnetic simulation data. A prototype was fabricated and characterized
using a calibrated vector network analyzer up to 67 GHz. Measurements confirm a
3 dB cutoff frequency at 13.5 GHz, insertion loss below 0.45 dB for frequencies
under 8 GHz, and more than 52.7 dB rejection above 17.3 GHz. The design offers
a compact, low-loss solution for near-band filtering and suppression of
quasiparticle-generating radiation in cryogenic quantum systems.

Motivation: Forrelation问题是展示量子与经典计算能力指数级差异的核心问题，研究其极端实例有助于深入理解这种差异。

Method: 通过线性代数方法连接Forrelation与bent布尔函数，分析极端Forrelation问题的量子与经典查询复杂度。

Result: 极端Forrelation问题可通过一次量子查询完美解决，而经典随机查询需要指数级复杂度。

Conclusion: 研究突显了一次精确量子查询的强大能力，并在小电路输入下展示了经典计算困难性。

Abstract: The Forrelation problem is a central problem that demonstrates an exponential
separation between quantum and classical capabilities. In this problem, given
query access to $n$-bit Boolean functions $f$ and $g$, the goal is to estimate
the Forrelation function $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)$, which measures the correlation
between $g$ and the Fourier transform of $f$.
  In this work we provide a new linear algebraic perspective on the Forrelation
problem, as opposed to prior analytic approaches. We establish a connection
between the Forrelation problem and bent Boolean functions and through this
connection, analyze an extremal version of the Forrelation problem where the
goal is to distinguish between extremal instances of Forrelation, namely
$(f,g)$ with $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=1$ and $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=-1$.
  We show that this problem can be solved with one quantum query and success
probability one, yet requires $\tilde{\Omega}\left(2^{n/4}\right)$ classical
randomized queries, even for algorithms with a one-third failure probability,
highlighting the remarkable power of one exact quantum query. We also study a
restricted variant of this problem where the inputs $f,g$ are computable by
small classical circuits and show classical hardness under cryptographic
assumptions.

Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a recently proposed algorithm
to approximate the ground-state wave function of many-body quantum systems on
near-term and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. In SQD, the quantum
computer acts as a sampling engine that generates the subspace in which the
Hamiltonian is classically diagonalized. A recently proposed SQD variant,
Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states
as circuits from which samples are collected. Convergence guarantees can be
derived for SKQD under similar assumptions to those of quantum phase
estimation, provided that the ground-state wave function is concentrated, i.e.,
has support on a small subset of the full Hilbert space. Implementations of
SKQD on current utility-scale quantum computers are limited by the depth of
time-evolution circuits needed to generate Krylov vectors. For many complex
many-body Hamiltonians of interest, such as the molecular electronic-structure
Hamiltonian, this depth exceeds the capability of state-of-the-art quantum
processors. In this work, we introduce a new SQD variant that combines SKQD
with the qDRIFT randomized compilation of the Hamiltonian propagator. The
resulting algorithm, termed SqDRIFT, enables SQD calculations at the utility
scale on chemical Hamiltonians while preserving the convergence guarantees of
SKQD. We apply SqDRIFT to calculate the electronic ground-state energy of
several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to system sizes beyond the reach
of exact diagonalization.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成满足约束的量子态，提升量子算法在QCBO问题中的表现。

Abstract: Quantum computing approaches excel at solving quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) problems, however solving quadratic constrained binary
optimization problems (QCBOs) is more challenging. In this work, we develop a
variational approach that creates an equal superposition of quantum states that
satisfy constraints in a QCBO. The method relies on flag qubits, one per
constraint, to identify when a constraint is violated or not. The resulting
equal superposition can be used as an initial state for quantum algorithms that
solve QUBOs/QCBOs such as Grover's search algorithm or the quantum approximate
optimization algorithm (QAOA). We test the approach on sets of one and two
linear inequality constraints and find that it is able to generate an equal
superposition of feasible states with a .98 AR on average. We then use the
approach to generate initial states for Grover-mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) and find
that GM-QAOA with the constraint gadgets yields significantly higher
probability of measuring the optimal solution than random guessing.

Abstract: In this contribution to Abraham Nitzan's Festschrift, we present a
perspective of theoretical research over the years that has pointed to the
potential of molecular processes to act as quantum information resources. Under
appropriate control, homonuclear dimer (diatom) dissociation (half-collision)
and the inverse process of atom-pair collisions are shown to reveal
translational (EPR-like) entanglement that enables molecular wavepacket
teleportation. When such processes involve electronic-state excitation of the
diatom, the fluorescence following dissociation can serve as an entanglement
witness that unravels the molecular-state characteristics and evolution. Such
entangling processes can also exhibit anomalous quantum thermodynamic features,
particularly temperature enhancement of a cavity field that interacts with
dissociated entangled diatoms.

Abstract: We analyze work extraction protocols using the long-lived quantum coherence
of a three-level quantum system, which is coupled to a thermal bath through
dipole-monopole interactions. We identify situations where persistent quantum
coherence arises, i.e., for systems with degenerate excited states with aligned
transition dipoles or nearly degenerate systems with small energy splittings.
By designing two innovative thermodynamic protocols involving energy-preserving
unitary operations, we show that quantum coherence can be transformed into
population asymmetry, serving as a quantum resource for work extraction. As the
system approaches final thermal equilibrium, the initial quantum coherence
effectively acts as fuel, being progressively consumed. Specifically, we
propose an optimized protocol capable of extracting the maximal extractable
work (MEW), measured by the free energy difference (FED), from quantum
coherence in a single-shot thermodynamic cycle. Our results highlight the
thermodynamic advantages of long-lived coherence in a three-level quantum
system and could influence future designs of coherence-driven quantum thermal
machines.

Abstract: Large-scale quantum systems require optical coherence between distant quantum
devices, necessitating spectral indistinguishability. Scalable solid-state
platforms offer promising routes to this goal. However, environmental
disorders, including dephasing, spectral diffusion, and spin-bath interactions,
influence the emitters' spectra and deteriorate the coherence. Using
statistical theory, we identify correlations in spectral diffusion from slowly
varying environmental coupling, revealing predictable dynamics extendable to
other disorders. Importantly, this could enable the development of an
anticipatory framework for forecasting and decoherence engineering in remote
quantum emitters. To validate this framework, we demonstrate that a machine
learning model trained on limited data can accurately forecast unseen spectral
behavior. Realization of such a model on distinct quantum emitters could reduce
the spectral shift by factors $\approx$ 2.1 to 15.8, depending on emitter
stability, compared to no prediction. This work presents, for the first time,
the application of anticipatory systems and replica theory to quantum
technology, along with the first experimental demonstration of internal
prediction that generalizes across multiple quantum emitters. These results
pave the way for real-time decoherence engineering in scalable quantum systems.
Such capability could lead to enhanced optical coherence and multi-emitter
synchronization, with broad implications for quantum communication,
computation, imaging, and sensing.

Abstract: The task of atom rearrangement has emerged in the last decade as a
fundamental building block for the development of neutral atom-based quantum
processors. However, despite many recent efforts to develop algorithms with
favorable asymptotic scaling, no time-optimal algorithm has been developed for
any rearrangement task. Moreover, no open-source code exists to reproduce or
benchmark existing algorithms, and to assist the development of new
rearrangement protocols. To address this deficiency, we develop an open-source
simulation framework for developing, comparing, and benchmarking algorithms
under realistic and customizable noise models. Using this framework, we
\textbf{a)} numerically extract lower bounds for the scaling of a time-optimal
rearrangement algorithm and compare it to existing heuristic algorithms
\textbf{b)} develop a naive dual-species algorithm able to prepare arbitrary
targets with near-unity success rate. With this framework, we hope to develop a
common tool for the community to study rearrangement, lower the barrier to
entry for new experimental groups, and stimulate progress in developing
algorithms which approach time-optimal scaling.

Abstract: We study a quantum annealing approach for estimating the ground state energy
of the Sherrington-Kirpatrick mean field spin glass model using the Suzuki-Kubo
dynamics applied for individual local magnetization components. The solutions
of the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast
annealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model:
Classical ($E^0= -0.7629 \pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \pm 0.0001$) and
Mixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best
known estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \dots$ . We infer that the continuous nature
of the magnetization variable used in the dynamics here is the reason for
reaching close to the ground state quickly and also the reason for not
observing the de-Almeida-Thouless line in this approach.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONNs) to
solving Sudoku puzzles, presenting a biologically inspired approach based on
phase synchronization. Each cell is represented by an oscillator whose phase
encodes a digit, and the synchronization is governed by the Kuramoto model. The
system dynamically evolves towards a valid solution by having the puzzle
constraints encoded into the weight matrix of the network, and through a
proposed novel phase mapping of the Sudoku digits. Experimental results show
that ONNs achieve high performance for puzzles with moderate difficulty and
outperform Hopfield Neural Networks, particularly in cases with up to 20
initially unknown values. Although the performance decreases with increased
ambiguity, ONNs still produce correct solutions in some of the iterations,
cases in which the baseline Hopfield Neural Network algorithm fails. The
findings support ONNs as a viable alternative for solving constraint
optimization problems and reinforce their relevance within emerging non-von
Neumann computing paradigms.

Abstract: We present a two-tone heterodyne optical readout scheme to extract
unequal-time density correlations along an arbitrary stationary interaction
path from a pancake-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate, using a modulated laser
probe. Analysing the measurement noise both from imprecision and backaction, we
identify the standard quantum limit for the signal-extraction scheme, and
examine how a class of two-mode squeezed initial states can be used to push
beyond this limit. As an application, we show how the readout scheme can be
used for an experimental realisation of acceleration-dependence of
quantum-vacuum fluctuations in the system, including the analogue spacetime
circular motion Unruh effect.

Abstract: BEC-based quantum sensors offer a huge, yet not fully explored potential in
gravimetry and accelerometry. In this paper, we study a possible setup for such
a device, which is a weakly interacting Bose gas trapped in a double-well
potential. In such a trap, the gas is known to exhibit Josephson oscillations,
which rely on the coherence between the potential wells. Applying the density
matrix approach, we consider transitions between the coherent, partially
incoherent, and fully incoherent states of the Bose gas. We show how, due to
the presence of weak interactions, collisional decoherence causes the Josephson
oscillations to decay with time. We further study the interplay of collisional
interaction and external acceleration, which leads to shifts of the oscillation
frequency. Finally, we investigate how this effect can be used to build a BEC
double-well accelerometer and give analytical expressions for its expected
sensitivity.

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and thermodynamics of
free fermions suddenly coupled to a localized defect in a one-dimensional
harmonic trap. This setup realizes a quantum quench transformation that gives
rise to the orthogonalization of the system's wave-function as an effect of the
localized perturbation. Using the Loschmidt echo and the Kirkwood-Dirac
quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution of the work done by the defect, we quantify
the extent and rate of the orthogonalization dynamics. In particular, we show
that initializing the system in a coherent superpositions of energy eigenstates
leads to non-classical features, such as Wigner function's negativity and
non-positivity of the work KDQ distribution. Starting from simple
single-particle superpositions and then progressing with coherent and cat
states of few-body fermionic systems, we uncover how quantum coherence and
few-body correlations shape the out-of-equilibrium response due to the presence
of the defect.

Abstract: By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein
condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a
pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can
be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single
particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential
growth and compare our observation with a Bogoliubov description. The growth
rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical
predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and
thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an
elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number,
which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are
switched off.

Abstract: Ultracold atoms in optical lattices are versatile testbeds to study and
manipulate equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of quantum many-body
systems whose behavior can be described by Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. In this
paper, we consider an ansatz wave-function which respects total particle-number
conservation for such systems and goes beyond mean-field theory; this
wave-function has the same complexity in the number of parameters as the
mean-field Gutzwiller ansatz, and captures quantum correlations and
entanglement via projection onto an effective low-energy manifold. This ansatz
can be exploited to study quantum phases observed in a large class of systems
realizable in such experimental platforms and is useful to study quantum
dynamics. We show that the relaxation dynamics of various out-of-equilibrium
initial states under sudden quench of Hamiltonian parameters can be studied
with this ansatz wavefunction within the framework of time-dependent
variational principle. We present a quantitative comparison with small-scale
exact diagonalization results in the 1D Bose-Hubbard model with and without
external trapping potentials.

Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral properties of
bosons harmonically confined in a quasi-2D plane and interacting via repulsive
Gaussian potential. We consider the lowest $100$ energy levels for systems of
$N=12, 16$ and $20$ bosons both for the moderate and strong interaction regimes
for the non-rotating ($L_{z}=0$) and the rotating single-vortex state
($L_{z}=N$). For higher angular momenta, $L_{z}=2N$ and $L_{z}=3N$, only the
strong interaction regime is considered. While the nearest-neighbor spacing
distribution (NNSD) $P(s)$ and the ratios of consecutive level spacings
distribution $P(r)$ are used to study the short-range correlations, the
Dyson-Mehta $\Delta_3$ statistic and the level number variance $\Sigma^2(L)$
are used to examine the long-range correlations. In the moderate interaction
regime when the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, the
non-rotating system exhibits a Poisson distribution, characteristic of the
regular energy spectra. In the strong interaction regime when the interaction
energy is comparable to the trap energy, the non-rotating system exhibits
chaotic behavior signified by GOE distribution. Furthermore, in the rotating
case for the single-vortex state ($L_{z} = N$) in the moderate interaction
regime, the system exhibits signatures of weak chaos with some degree of
regularity in the energy-level spectra. However, in the strong interaction
regime for the rotating case with $L_{z} = N$, $2N$ and $3N$, the system
exhibits strong chaotic behavior. The rotation is found to contribute to an
enhancement of chaotic behavior in the system for both the moderate and the
strong interaction regimes. Our results of NNSD analysis are supported by the
analysis of the ratios of consecutive level spacings distribution $P(r)$.

Abstract: Recently, cold atoms mixtures have attracted broad interest due to their
novel properties and exotic quantum effects with respect to single-component
systems. In this paper the focus is on massive many-vortex states and their
dynamics. Vortex configurations characterized by the same discrete rotational
symmetry are investigated when confined within topologically nonequivalent
geometries, and the relative stability properties at varying number of vortices
and infilling mass are highlighted. It is numerically shown how massive
many-vortex systems, in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates, can host the
bosonic tunneling of the infilling component both in a disordered way, with
tunneling events involving two or more close vortices, or in an almost-periodic
way when the vortices are organized in persisting necklaces or star-lattices.
The purpose is to explore a variety of situations involving the interplay
between the highly-nonlinear vortex dynamics and the inter-vortex atomic
transfer, and so to better understand the conditions for the onset of Josephson
supercurrents in rotating systems, or to reveal phenomena that could be of
interest for a future application e.g. in the context of atomtronics.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P,
Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum
many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad
(GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution
and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go
beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is
possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a
positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive
the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the
path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck
equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral
representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability,
which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by
changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that
we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral,
and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition
of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness
condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we
confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact
dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of
numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work
clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and
simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.

Abstract: We investigate coupled dynamics of spinless fermions on a one-dimensional
lattice and spins on the links. When the hopping integral and the on-site
potential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the
low-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical
axion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\theta$ is coupled to the
electric field $E$ as $\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in
response to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for
charge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in
the Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link
spins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the
full-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method. Even though we do not
explicitly introduce the axion Lagrangian in solving the fermion-spin coupled
many-body dynamics, the full-quantum results agree well with those with the
classical spin approximation, including the dynamics of the axion field and
fermion transport. In addition, we find that the quantum correlation between
spins accelerates the dynamics of axion fields as the suppression of the
expectation values of the link spins allows them to rotate easily. We also
propose a possible experimental setup for cold-atomic systems to implement the
Hamiltonian in this study.

Abstract: Stochastic thermodynamics is the field of study relating fluctuations in
stochastic systems to thermodynamic quantities. The total entropy production
(EP), is central to the thermodynamic classification of systems.
Non-equilibrium systems manifestly all have non-zero EP and therefore impose an
"arrow of time". Thermodynamic inequalities are lower bounds on the total EP
and are especially useful when only parts of systems are operationally
accessible. We use a stochastic calculus approach to directly derive and
generalise three classes of inequalities for Markov jump processes using
correlations of path observables, e.g., currents and densities. Our theoretical
predictions are compared with simulations, where a good agreement is observed.
The thermodynamic bounds we investigate include the thermodynamic uncertainty
relation (TUR), thermodynamic transport bound (TB), and thermodynamic
correlation bound (CB). We provide insight into the saturation conditions for
these bounds and to what degree saturation can be achieved. Additionally, for
the TUR and TB, we show how the bounds are related, which includes identifying
a diffusion coefficient for jump dynamics. %An example using a toy model shows
how the CB may yield a negative lower bound on the total entropy production,
contrary to the non-negative bound that the TUR and TB yield. Comparisons are
drawn between the TUR and TB for relaxation and stationary processes in
biologically relevant settings. Specifically, calmodulin folding dynamics and
secondary active transport, where differences in long-time relaxation and
convergence are observed. For a systematic way to construct models, we
formulate two methods to drive systems out of equilibrium without changing the
stationary probability distribution.

subsystems. The route towards ergodicity is explored as a function of the

Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the Eigenstates Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH).
We highlight a coupling regime of disparity between the spectral statistics
that indicates chaos, and ergodicity measures that indicate lack of ETH
thermalization. The analysis involves a revision of the energy shell concept,
in a way that is consistent but independent of the semiclassical perspective.

Abstract: The degree of predictability of large avalanche events in the directed
sandpile model is studied. A waiting time based prediction strategy which
exploits the local anticorrelation of large events is discussed. With this
strategy we show analytically and numerically that large events are predictable
to some extent, and that this predictability persists in the thermodynamic
limit. We introduce another strategy which predicts large avalanches in the
future based on the present excess density in the sandpile. We obtain the exact
conditional probabilities for large events given an excess density, and use
this to determine the exact form of the ROC predictability curves. We show that
for this strategy, the model is predictable only for finite lattice sizes, and
unpredictable in the thermodynamic limit. This behaviour is to be contrasted
with previously established numerical studies carried out for Manna sandpiles.

Abstract: We study site percolation on a square lattice with random compact
diamond-shaped neighborhoods. Each site $s$ is connected to others within a
neighborhood in the shape of a diamond of radius $r_s$, where $r_s$ is
uniformly chosen from the set $\{i, i+1, \ldots, m\}$ with $i \leq m$. The
model is analyzed for all values of $i = 0, \ldots, 7$ and $m = i, \ldots, 10$,
where $\overline{z}(i,m)$ denotes the average number of neighbors per site and
$p_c(i,m)$ is the critical percolation threshold. For each fixed $i$, the
product $\overline{z}(i,m)\,p_c(i,m)$ is found to converge to a constant as $m
\to \infty$. Such behavior is expected when $i=m$ (single diamond sizes), for
which the product $\overline{z}(i)\,p_c(i)$ tends toward $2^d\eta_c$, where
$\eta_c$ is the continuum percolation threshold for diamond-shaped regions or
aligned squares in two dimensions ($d=2$). This case is further examined for $i
= 1, \ldots, 10$, and the expected convergence is confirmed. The particular
case $i = m$ was first studied numerically by Gouker and Family in 1983. We
also study the relation to systems of deposited diamond-shaped objects on a
square lattice. For monodisperse diamonds of radius $r$, there is a direct
mapping to percolation with a diamond-shaped neighborhood of radius $2r+1$, but
when there is a distribution of object sizes, there is no such mapping. We
study the case of mixtures of diamonds of radius $r=0$ and $r=1$, and compare
it to the continuum percolation of disks of two sizes.

Abstract: The Bak-Sneppen (BS) evolution model remains a well-studied example of
self-organized criticality (SOC). We propose a simple variant of the BS model,
where the global fitness fluctuations show $1/f^{\alpha}$ noise with a spectral
exponent nearly equal to 1 (pink noise). To further corroborate, we compute the
two-time autocorrelation function that decays logarithmically. The $1/f$ noise
in the global fitness is robust and hyper-universal. We identify the dominance
of non-trivial local fitness cross-power spectra.

Abstract: We applied the Tsallis statistics with the conventional expectation value to
a system of free particles, adopting the equilibrium temperature which is often
called the physical temperature. The entropic parameter $q$ in the Tsallis
statistics is less than one for power-law-like distribution. The well-known
relation between the energy and the temperature in the Boltzmann--Gibbs
statistics holds in the Tsallis statistics, when the equilibrium temperature is
adopted. We derived the momentum distribution and the correlation in the
Tsallis statistics. The momentum distribution and the correlation in the
Tsallis statistics are different from those in the Boltzmann--Gibbs statistics,
even when the equilibrium temperature is adopted. These quantities depend on
$q$ and $N$, where $N$ is the number of particles. The correlation exists even
for free particles. The parameter $q$ satisfies the inequality $1-1/(3N/2+1) <
q < 1$.

Abstract: The Hamiltonian of the $N$-state clock model is written in terms of a coupled
Temperley-Lieb (TL) algebra defined by $N-1$ types of TL generators. This
generalizes a previous result for $N=3$ obtained by J. F. Fjelstad and T.
M\r{a}nsson [J. Phys. A {\bf 45} (2012) 155208]. The $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric
clock chain Hamiltonian expressed in terms of the coupled TL algebra
generalizes the well known correspondence between the $N$-state Potts model and
the TL algebra. The algebra admits a pictorial description in terms of a planar
algebra involving parafermionic operators attached to $n$ strands. A key
ingredient in the resolution of diagrams is the string Fourier transform. The
pictorial presentation also allows a description of the Hilbert space. We also
give a pictorial description of the representation related to the staggered XX
spin chain. Just as the pictorial representation of the TL algebra has proven
to be particularly useful in providing a visual and intuitive way to understand
and manipulate algebraic expressions, it is anticipated that the pictorial
representation of the coupled TL algebra may lead to further progress in
understanding various aspects of the $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ clock model, including
the superintegrable chiral Potts model.

Conclusion: 该原理和模型具有普适性，可为非平衡系统中的自组织研究提供新视角。

Abstract: Recent observations of coordinated self-organisation (SO) of stress and
structure in granular systems provide insight into the fundamental principle
underlying this phenomenon. It is first argued here that SO emerges when a
minute subset of configurations are significantly more stable than the rest and
therefore survive the noise in the system much longer to be observed. This
principle goes deeper than recently proposed energy considerations. Guided by
this principle, a statistical mechanics model is formulated then for SO in
these systems and its extension to three dimensions is outlined. The principle
holds beyond granular systems and the model is extended next to describe
emergence of SO in more general systems. The application of the model is
illustrated for the specific example of laning. Parallels of the modelling
approach to traditional statistical mechanics provide useful insight that
should assist in modelling SO in other out-of-equilibrium systems.

Motivation: 探索模型基态相是否影响其热化性质，以及非均匀性（δ）和次近邻相互作用（J2）如何共同影响系统热平衡。

Method: 通过系统分析不同参数（δ和J2）下的模型，评估其是否符合本征态热化假设（ETH）。

Result: 中间δ（~0.5）和J2（~0.5至1）参数区域最符合ETH，而大δ和小J2区域系统进入局域相。

Conclusion: 模型的热化行为受参数δ和J2的复杂相互作用影响，中间参数区域更易满足ETH。

Abstract: We revisit the J1-J2 frustrated Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with dimerization
({\delta}) or modulation in the nearest-neighbor couplings to investigate its
thermalization behavior. While the dimerization tends to induce localization,
the next-nearest-neighbor interaction J2 generally favors thermalization,
making the assessment of the model's compliance with the Eigenstate
Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) particularly subtle. The challenge is further
compounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is
necessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of
this symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current
study is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the
well-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its
thermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between
two competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\delta}) and the
beyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to
thermal equilibrium. A systematic analysis shows that the ETH is most strongly
satisfied for intermediate values of {\delta} (~ 0.5) with J2 ranging from
intermediate (~ 0.5) to large (~ 1)- a parameter regime falls within the spiral
ground-state phase. It is also found that when the system is in the gapless
ground-state phase (which falls within the N'eel phase), the ETH is more prone
to violation. In the regime of large {\delta} and small J2, the system is seen
to enter a localized phase (characterized here by modulation in
density-of-states; assessing ETH compliance is less meaningful for this phase.

Method: 使用具有恒定能隙的简单系统和1D Ising模型，分析随机矩阵的特征值及其对热化时间的影响，并采用Kullback-Leibler散度和Fisher信息量化热化程度。

Result: 大能隙时冷却过程更快，小能隙时加热过程更快；Kullback-Leibler散度和Fisher信息在中期和长期表现出相同的信息内容。

Conclusion: 热化过程的时间尺度与能隙大小密切相关，冷却或加热的速率优势取决于系统能隙的尺度。

Abstract: We investigate the thermalization of a stochastic system with discrete phase
space, initially at equilibrium at temperature $T_i$ and then termalizing in an
environment at temperature $T_f$ , considering both cases $T_i > T_f$ and $T_i
< T_f$. For the simple case of a system with constant energy gaps, we show that
the relation between the time scales of the cooling and heating processes is
not univocal, and depends on the magnitude of the energy gap itself.
Specifically the eigenvalues of the corresponding stochastic matrix set the
time scales of the relaxation process and for large energy gaps the cooling
process is found to exhibit the shortest relaxation times to equilibrium while
the heating process is found to be faster at all scales for small gaps. We
consider both the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Fisher information and
its related quantities to quantify the degree of thermalization of the system.
In the intermediate to long time regime both quantities are found to bear the
same type of information concerning the rate of thermalization, and follow the
ordering predicted by the dynamic eigenvalues. We then consider a more complex
system with a more intricate stochastic matrix, namely a 1D Ising model, and
confirm the findings on the existence of two regimes, one in which cooling
becomes faster than heating. We make contact with a previous work where an
harmonic oscillator was used as working fluid and the heating process was
always found to be faster than the cooling one.

Conclusion: 研究为石墨烯系统中相关性和对称性破缺的作用提供了新见解，将推动未来实验和理论研究。

Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene systems with different number of layers feature an
abundance of correlated phases and superconducting states in experimental
measurements with different doping and displacement fields. Some of the
superconducting pockets can emerge from - or close to - one of the correlated
states. Therefore, studying the phase diagram of the correlated phases for
varying number of layers could be useful to interpret the experimental
observations. To achieve this, systematic Hartree-Fock calculations have been
performed to build the phase diagram of rhombohedral (ABC-stacked) graphene for
different number of layers, in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions.
By varying the external displacement field and carrier density, a cascade of
metallic partially-isospin-polarized phases that spontaneously break spin
and/or valley (flavor) symmetries is found. In addition, these states can
present nematicity, stabilized by electron-electron interactions, exhibiting
rich internal complexity. Polarized states are more stable for electron doping,
and they are found for systems with up to 20 layers. Moreover, the tunability
of the phase diagram via substrate screening and spin-orbit coupling proximity
effects has been studied. Our results offer new insights into the role of
correlations and symmetry breaking in graphitic systems which will motivate
future experimental and theoretical works.

Abstract: The interplay of topology and correlations defines a new playground to study
boundary criticality in quantum systems. We employ large scale auxiliary field
quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a two-dimensional Kane-Mele-Hubbard
model on the honeycomb lattice with zig-zag edges and the Hubbard U-term tuned
to the three-dimensional XY bulk critical point. Upon varying the Hubbard-U
term on the edge we observe a boundary phase transition from an ordinary phase
with a helical Luttinger liquid edge decoupled from the critical bulk to an
extraordinary-log phase characterized by a logarithmically diverging spin
stiffness. We find that the spectral functions exhibit distinct features in the
two phases giving potential experimental signatures.

Conclusion: 研究结果为TMO的分类和新研究提供了理论依据，有助于理解其复杂电子行为。

Abstract: The low-energy properties of transition metal oxides (TMOs) are governed by
the electrons occupying strongly correlated $d$-orbitals that are hybridized
with surrounding ligand oxygen $p$ orbitals to varying degrees. Their physics
is thus established by a complex interplay between the transition-metal
(TM)-ligand hopping $t$, charge transfer energy $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$, and
on-site TM Hubbard repulsion $U$. Here, we study the spectral properties of a
one-dimensional (1D) analog of such a $pd$ system, with alternating TM $d$ and
ligand anion $p$ orbitals situated along a chain. Using the density matrix
renormalization group method, we study the model's single-particle spectral
function, x-ray absorption spectrum, and dynamical spin structure factor as a
function of $\Delta_\mathrm{CT}$ and $U$. In particular, we present results
spanning from the Mott insulating ($\Delta_\mathrm{CT} > U$) to negative charge
transfer regime $\Delta_\mathrm{CT} < 0$ to better understand the ground and
momentum-resolved excited state properties of these different regimes. Our
results can guide new studies on TMOs that seek to situate them within the
Mott-Hubbard/charge transfer insulator classification scheme.

Conclusion: 为SrCoO$_3$的非平凡磁基态提供实验证据，为设计稳健铁磁系统提供新途径。

Abstract: Epitaxial strain in transition-metal oxides can induce dramatic changes in
electronic and magnetic properties. A recent study on the epitaxially strained
SrCoO$_3$ thin films revealed persistent ferromagnetism even across a
metal-insulator transition. This challenges the current theoretical
predictions, and the nature of the local spin state underlying this robustness
remains unresolved. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray
scattering (RIXS) at the Co-$L_3$ edge to probe the spin states of strained
SrCoO$_3$ thin films. Compared with CoO$_6$ cluster multiplet calculations, we
identify a ground state composed of a mixed high- and low-spin configuration,
distinct from the previously proposed intermediate-spin state. Our results
demonstrate that the robustness of ferromagnetism arises from the interplay
between this mixed spin state and the presence of ligand holes associated with
negative charge transfer. These findings provide direct experimental evidence
for a nontrivial magnetic ground state in SrCoO$_3$ and offer new pathways for
designing robust ferromagnetic systems in correlated oxides.

Conclusion: TCFM模型为铜氧化物的电子结构提供了全面理解，集成光谱分析是研究强关联电子系统的有效方法。

Abstract: Electronic structure of high-temperature superconducting cuprates is studied
by analyzing experimental data independently obtained from two complementary
spectroscopies, one, quasiparticle interference (QPI) measured by
scanning-tunneling microscopy and the other, angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) and by combining these two sets of data in a unified
theoretical analysis. Through explicit calculations of experimentally
measurable quantities, we show that a simple two-component fermion model (TCFM)
representing electron fractionalization succeeds in reproducing various
detailed features of these experimental data: ARPES and QPI data are
concomitantly reproduced by the TCFM in full energy and momentum spaces. The
measured QPI pattern reveals a signature characteristic of the TCFM, distinct
from the conventional single-component prediction, supporting the validity of
the electron fractionalization in the cuprate. The integrated analysis also
solves the puzzles of ARPES and QPI data that are seemingly inconsistent with
each other. The overall success of the TCFM offers a comprehensive
understanding of the electronic structure of the cuprates. We further predict
that a characteristic QPI pattern should appear in the unoccupied high-energy
part if the fractionalization is at work. We propose that
integrated-spectroscopy analyses offer a promising way to explore challenging
issues of strongly correlated electron systems.

Abstract: Quantum dots are versatile systems for exploring quantum transport, electron
correlations, and many-body phenomena such as the Kondo effect. While
equilibrium properties are well understood through methods like the numerical
renormalization group and density matrix renormalization group, nonequilibrium
transport remains a major theoretical challenge. From the experimental point of
view, recent advances in nanofabrication and measurement techniques have
enabled the investigation of far-from-equilibrium regimes. These conditions
give rise to new transport phenomena, where strong correlations and
nonequilibrium dynamics interplay in complex ways; beyond the reach of
conventional linear response theory. To meet these challenges, new approaches
such as nonequilibrium Green's functions, real-time NRG, and time-dependent
DMRG have emerged. This work reviews the established results for quantum dot
transport in and beyond the linear regime, highlights recent theoretical and
experimental advances, and discusses open problems and future prospects.

momenta. Furthermore, we find that the RSGA can be applied to other eigenstates
of the Lieb lattice in an approximate manner. Numerical simulations reveal that
there exist sets of eigenstates, which obey a quasi-RSGA. These states act as
energy towers within the low-lying excited spectrum, indicating that they are

Abstract: We formulate a path-integral Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating lattice
systems consisting of fictitious particles governed by a generalized exchange
statistics. This method, initially proposed for continuum systems, introduces a
continuous parameter $\xi$ in the partition function that interpolates between
bosonic ($\xi = 1$) and fermionic ($\xi = -1$) statistics. We generalize this
approach to discrete lattice models and apply it to the two-dimensional Hubbard
model of fictitious particles, including the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models as
special cases. By combining reweighting and $\xi$-extrapolation techniques, we
access both half-filled and doped regimes. In particular, we demonstrate that
the method remains effective even in strongly correlated, doped systems where
the fermion sign problem hinders conventional quantum Monte Carlo approaches.
Our results validate the applicability of the fictitious particle framework on
lattice models and establish it as a promising tool for sign-problem mitigation
in strongly interacting fermionic systems.

Conclusion: 通过扩展Floquet理论至开放系统，为FE在材料科学等领域的应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This article reviews theoretical methods for analyzing Floquet engineering
(FE) phenomena in open (dissipative) quantum or classical systems, with an
emphasis on our recent results. In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum
systems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum
systems, that is based on the Schr\"odinger equation. However, if we consider
the FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but
finite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is
inevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative
systems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show
that a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the
balance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to
the bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet
theory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation
of motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied
only to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution
function of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can
arrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence
of the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the
Floquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological
insulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum,
etc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs.

Conclusion: SrHfO3基超晶格是调控氧化物Rashba效应的理想平台，对自旋电子器件有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Harnessing the interplay of symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling, we
investigate Rashba spin splitting in buckled honeycomb
(SrHfO$_3$)$_2$/(LaAlO$_3$)$_4$(111) superlattices using density functional
theory (DFT) calculations with a Hubbard $U$ term and a Wannier-based
tight-binding (TB) model. In the non-centrosymmetric $P1$ phase, pronounced
Rashba-type splitting emerges near the $M$ and $K$ points accompanied by a
helical in-plane spin texture, while the centrosymmetric $P321$ phase remains
spin-degenerate. A Wannier-based tight-binding Hamiltonian, extended
analytically with on-site spin-orbit coupling, reproduces the DFT results. A
Rashba coefficient of $\alpha_R = 0.34$ eV$ \cdot$ Angstrom and energy $E_R =
29$ meV are extracted directly from the DFT band structure placing the system
among moderately strong oxide Rashba materials. $\Gamma$-phonon calculation
confirms the dynamical stability of the $P1$ structure and the results reveal
the critical role of symmetry breaking and inter-orbital hybridization in
enabling Rashba effects, supported by enhanced imaginary
second-nearest-neighbor hoppings and Berry curvature. These findings establish
SrHfO$_3$-based buckled heterostructures as a promising platform for
engineering Rashba effects in oxide-based spintronic devices.

Abstract: The effect of the Hund's J terms in various DFT+U+J corrections to semi-local
spin-density functional theory is assessed for a series of four octahedrally
coordinated Fe(II) spin-crossover molecules spanning the covalent end of the
ligand field spectrum. We report values and analyze trends for the Hubbard U
and Hund's J parameters determined via minimum-tracking linear response for all
valence atomic subspaces and relevant spin states in these molecules. We then
methodically apply them via simplified rotationally-invariant Hubbard
functionals in search of the simplest combination to yield reliable adiabatic
energy differences with respect to those obtained using CASPT2/CC. The observed
failure of canonical, positively-signed Hund's J terms in furthering the
already robust capacity of DFT+U to obtain accurate energetics prompts an
evaluation of their limitations when seeking to account for the static
correlation phenomena in such strongly covalent systems and suggests directions
for their improvement.

Conclusion: 锯齿链模型对完全表征atacamite的低能磁性至关重要，揭示了两种一维链能量尺度的独特分离。

Abstract: We report inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on the magnetically
frustrated $S=\frac12$ sawtooth-chain compound atacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$
featuring inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites. Transverse to the sawtooth
chains, INS reveals two dispersive spin-wave modes and a gap of at least 0.75
meV. This behavior is rationalized within a zigzag-chain model of Cu(2) spins
in an effective magnetic field of Cu(1) spins. The model is compatible with
first-principles calculations and accounts for INS dispersions within linear
spin-wave theory calculations. Our results reveal a unique case of an effective
separation of energy scales between two differently oriented one-dimensional
chains, with the zigzag-chain model being essential to fully characterize
atacamite's low-energy magnetism.

Abstract: I present a theory of strange metals that is based on the following
asumptions: (i) wavelike coherence is lost at each hop between neighboring
atoms in the solid, i.e. the metal is bad, (ii) the carriers move independently
from one another and (iii) the motion of the charge carriers obeys the
correspondence principle, i.e. the quantum-mechanically averaged carrier
diffusion in time is the same as in the classical case. The theory explains
$T$-linear resistivity with apparently Planckian scattering rates as well as
both the stretched Drude and displaced Drude peaks that are commonly observed
in optical absorption experiments. The present framework might also indicate a
solution to the problem of universal dielectric relaxation in insulators.

Result: 两种方法在二维掺杂Hubbard模型上结果一致，验证了嵌入方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GT-HMC嵌入WV-HMC可提升采样效率，同时保持结果准确性。

Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an
efficient and versatile algorithm that simultaneously mitigates both the sign
problem and the ergodicity problem -- the latter being intrinsic to algorithms
based on Lefschetz thimbles. We consider a situation in which the maximum flow
time can be set to a small value, as occurs when WV-HMC is applied to the doped
Hubbard model using a nonphysical redundant parameter. An optimal choice of
this parameter significantly reduces the sign problem on the original
integration surface and allows the maximum flow time to remain small, a feature
that facilitates increasing the system size while keeping the computation time
modest. However, as the worldvolume becomes a thin layer, it becomes
increasingly difficult to explore it efficiently, leading to potential
ergodicity issues. To overcome this limitation, we propose embedding the
Generalized-thimble HMC (GT-HMC) into the WV-HMC framework. GT-HMC performs HMC
updates on a deformed surface at a fixed flow time. Although it suffers from
ergodicity issues due to infinitely high potential barriers at the zeros of the
Boltzmann weight, it enables more efficient exploration within the allowed
region. Furthermore, its molecular dynamics step size can typically be taken to
be larger than in WV-HMC. GT-HMC is thus better suited for sampling regions
where ergodicity issues are not serious. We provide a proof that GT-HMC can be
embedded within the WV-HMC algorithm, and verify that the two methods -- the
pure WV-HMC and the combined version -- yield consistent results within
statistical errors for the two-dimensional doped Hubbard model on a $6 \times
6$ spatial lattice at $T/\kappa = 1/6.4\simeq 0.156$ and $U/\kappa = 8.0$ with
Trotter number $N_t = 20$ ($\kappa$: hopping parameter).

TL;DR: 论文研究了一类新型拓扑超导相，受精确费米子宇称对称性和平均晶体对称性保护，属于平均晶体对称性保护拓扑态（ACSPT），包括许多仅在无序或退相干条件下出现的本征ACSPT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对称性保护拓扑相（SPT）需要精确对称性保护，而平均SPT（ASPT）相在对称性仅在统计上恢复时仍保持稳健。研究旨在分类这些相并揭示其在无序系统中的独特性。

Method: 扩展实空间块态构造框架以纳入平均晶体对称性，通过装饰低维细胞和重新定义无阻碍条件来分类ASPT。

Result: 发现许多晶体拓扑超导体在现实缺陷下仍保持定义良好，揭示了无清洁系统类比的本征平均对称性保护相的丰富景观。

Conclusion: 研究提供了分类ASPT的系统方法，并验证了其在无序系统中的稳健性，为理解拓扑相在非理想条件下的行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: We investigate a novel class of topological superconducting phases protected
by exact fermion-parity symmetry and average crystalline symmetries. These
phases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected
topological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs --
topological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence.
Unlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require
exact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as
the symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state
ensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state
construction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this
generalized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases,
and the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the
constraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections. This provides a
physically transparent and systematic method for classifying ASPTs with spatial
symmetries that are only preserved statistically. We further validate our
classification using a generalized spectral sequence analysis, which serves as
an independent consistency check. Our results demonstrate that many crystalline
topological superconductors remain well defined under realistic imperfections,
and they uncover a rich landscape of intrinsically average-symmetry-protected
phases that have no analog in clean systems.

Abstract: Hysteretic gate responses of two-dimensional material heterostructures serve
as sensitive probes of the underlying electronic states and hold significant
promise for the development of novel nanoelectronic devices. Here we identify a
new mechanism of hysteretic behavior in
graphene/$h$BN/$\alpha$-$\mathrm{RuCl_3}$ charge transfer field effect devices.
The hysteresis loop exhibits a sharp onset under low temperatures and evolves
symmetrically relative to the charge transfer equilibrium. Unlike conventional
flash memory devices, the charge transfer heterostructure features a
transparent tunneling barrier and its hysteretic gate response is induced by
the dynamic tuning of interfacial dipoles originating from quantum exchange
interactions. The system acts effectively as a ferroelectric and gives rise to
remarkable tunability of the hysteretic gate response under external electrical
bias. Our work unveils a novel mechanism for engineering hysteretic behaviors
via dynamic interfacial quantum dipoles.

Abstract: Unconventional $p$-wave magnets (UPMs) with odd-parity spin textures have
attracted interest for their zero net magnetization and anisotropic spin-split
Fermi surfaces. Here, we explore a non-Hermitian open quantum system composed
of a ferromagnet and a UPM, subjected to an external magnetic field and
off-resonant circularly polarized light (CPL), serving as tunable control
parameters. We demonstrate the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the
proposed junction, whose locations can be modulated by the intrinsic properties
of the UPM. These EPs exhibit different multiplicities and formation conditions
compared to those in even-parity magnets (dubbed $d$- wave altermagnets), a
distinction attributable to the preserved time-reversal and broken inversion
symmetries characteristic of UPMs. We find that both the unidirectional
magnetic field (with adjustable strength and orientation) and the CPL induce
momentum-direction-dependent modifications to the EPs, such as their shifting,
tilting, merging, or annihilation, supported by analyses of spin projection and
eigenvector overlap. Although both perturbations influence the EP structure,
they operate via distinct mechanisms: CPL induces a global Floquet
re-normalization, enabling dynamic tunability through light, whereas the
unidirectional magnetic field selectively alters orientation-aligned terms,
lacking such tunability. Beyond revealing EP dynamics in UPM-based junctions,
our results highlight UPMs as promising platforms for non-Hermitian phenomena
in future spintronics.

Abstract: We reveal the role of aurophilic interactions in the formation and

Specifically, we identify electron transport signatures through 1D single
chains containing variable number of monomeric repeats of gold cyanide AuCN,
linked in series (AuCN)n, and through adjacent molecular wires linked in

exponential decay of conductance in (AuCN)n 1D wires for n=1-3. But when bound
in parallel, aurophilic coupling through the gold atoms of neighboring chains
reorders electronic states and results in significant enhancement of
conductance. Our work reveals that metallophilicity can play a significant role
in junction assembly and electron transport characteristics.

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase characterized by symmetry-protected,
momentum-dependent spin splitting and collinear compensated magnetic moments,
has thus far been explored primarily in periodic crystals. In this Letter, we
extend the concept of altermagnetism to quasicrystals -- aperiodic systems with
long-range order and noncrystallographic rotational symmetries. Using a
hyperspatial projection framework, we construct decorated Ammann-Beenker and
Penrose quasicrystalline lattices with inequivalent sublattices and investigate
a Hubbard model with anisotropic hopping. We demonstrate that
interaction-induced N\'eel order on such lattices gives rise to alternating
spin-polarized spectral functions that reflect the underlying quasicrystalline
symmetry, revealing the emergence of unconventional $g$-wave (octagonal) and
$h$-wave (decagonal) altermagnetism. Our symmetry analysis and low-energy
effective theory further reveal unconventional altermagnetic spin splitting,
which is compatible with quasicrystalline rotational symmetry. Our work shows
that quasicrystals provide a fertile ground for realizing unconventional
altermagnetic phases beyond crystallographic constraints, offering a platform
for novel magnetisms and transport phenomena unique to quasiperiodic systems.

Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that spin dynamics may acquire an inertial
effect in a few metallic magnets, deviating from the traditional inertia-free
dynamics. It remains an open question to ascertain the physical mechanisms and
universality of the spin inertia across diverse magnetic systems. Here, we show
that spin inertia generates nutation spin waves in the terahertz regime, which
can hybridize with the surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) conducting
materials such as graphene. By exciting hybrid spin wave-plasmon modes and
analyzing the reflection spectrum of a 2D material$|$magnet heterostructure, we
propose a method to quantitatively determine the strength of spin inertia in
magnetic layers. Our approach is universally applicable to all types of
magnetic insulators and could advance the future exploration of the magnitude
and physical mechanism of spin inertia.

Abstract: Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their
properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission
of the circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers the polarization of the
emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity
in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies
on the large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and
conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly-polarized emission modes.
We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under
intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled
harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description
which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of
birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows
analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and
elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.

Conclusion: 量子霍尔流体中的光诱导磁化效应揭示了其独特的横向响应特性，并展示了在光学量子打印中的潜在应用。

Abstract: We report two light-induced orbital magnetization effects in quantum Hall
(QH) fluids, stemming from their transverse response. The first is a purely
transverse contribution to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), where circularly
polarized light induces a DC magnetization by stirring the charged fluid. This
contribution dominates the IFE in the QH regime. The second is the orbital
inverse Cotton-Mouton effect (ICME), in which linearly polarized light
generates a DC magnetization. Since the applied field in the ICME does not
break time-reversal symmetry, the induced magnetization directly probes the
chiral orbital response of the fluid at the driving frequency. We estimate that
the resulting magnetization lies in the range of 0.5-10 Bohr magnetons per
charge carrier in materials such as graphene and transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) in the QH regime. Finally, we show that the induced
magnetization is accompanied by a local correction to the static particle
density, enabling optical quantum printing of density profiles into the QH
fluid.

Conclusion: 自发对称破缺与拓扑性质的关系复杂，自旋版本模型展示了非平凡拓扑相的存在。

Abstract: We study the interplay of spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological
properties in interacting one-dimensional models. We solve these models using
bozonization and identify topologically non-trivial phases by counting the
additional degeneracy (affiliated with the edge modes) of a finite-size system
relative to the infinite one. We find even if the mean-field solution is
topological, this may not be true when it arises from spontaneous symmetry
breaking, including in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This implies that
the original SSH model, as presented by Su, Schrieffer, and Heeger, is
topologically trivial, as opposed to its mean-field version. A spinful version,
on the other hand, does exhibit a topologically non-trivial phase. In that
state, both mean-field solutions are topologically non-trivial and correspond
to non-interacting SSH chains in the opposite phases with the winding number
$\nu=1$. We show that this phase is protected by a chiral symmetry, similar to
the non-interacting phases.

Conclusion: 耦合量子阱结构为优化AlGaN/GaN异质结构的迁移率提供了有效途径，尤其在特定间距和温度条件下。

Abstract: We demonstrate that coupled AlGaN/GaN quantum wells with asymmetric widths
($L_1-L_2<30 $ A achieve up to 4.5 times higher mobility than single wells at
optimal separation (d = 100 A). Crucially, mobility surpasses single wells when
d>40 A reversing the trend at smaller distances. This enhancement stems from
double-layer screening that suppresses remote/background impurities and
dislocations, while LO phonon scattering remains unaffected. For identical
wells, coupled systems underperform single wells at d<40 A but exceed them
beyond this threshold. Peak gains occur at cryogenic temperatures (77 K). Our
results provide a robust theoretical framework to optimize mobility in
AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, reducing experimental trial-and-error in quantum

Abstract: Over the years, Berry curvature, which is associated with the imaginary part
of the quantum geometric tensor, has profoundly impacted many branches of
physics. Recently, quantum metric, the real part of the quantum geometric
tensor, has been recognized as indispensable in comprehensively characterizing
the intrinsic properties of condensed matter systems. The intrinsic
second-order nonlinear conductivity induced by the quantum metric has attracted
significant recent interest. However, its expression varies across the
literature. Here, we reconcile this discrepancy by systematically examining the
nonlinear conductivity using the standard perturbation theory, the wave packet
dynamics, and the Luttinger-Kohn approach. Moreover, inspired by the Dirac
model, we propose a toy model that suppresses the Berry-curvature-induced
nonlinear transport, making it suitable for studying the quantum-metric-induced
nonlinear conductivity. Our theory can be further extended to include disorder
effects and higher-order quantum geometric contributions, paving the way for a
more comprehensive and systematic understanding of nonlinear transport.

Abstract: Multifold fermions, quasiparticles with multiple degeneracy protected by
crystalline symmetries, exhibit a variety of intriguing phenomena stemming from
their large topological charges and unique band structures. A comprehensive
understanding of their response to external stimuli remains challenging,
especially for types protected by nonsymmorphic symmetries where various
degrees of freedom are intricately coupled. Here, we systematically construct
effective models for multifold fermions that incorporate external fields based
on crystalline symmetry. Specifically, we develop a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot
\boldsymbol{p}$ model for the threefold fermion protected by space group
I2$_1$3 (No.~199) in the presence of spin--orbit coupling, and derive the terms
for external fields. By complementing this with a tight-binding model, we
investigate the magnetic field response and reveal the pair annihilation of
magnetic monopoles. Furthermore, we construct a $\boldsymbol{k} \cdot
\boldsymbol{p}$ model for the eightfold fermion in space group P$\bar{4}3n1'$
(No.~218), including its coupling to external fields. This work provides a
robust theoretical foundation for advancing the study of external field
responses and transport phenomena in multifold fermions, opening new avenues to
explore their rich physics.

Abstract: This paper presents the possibility for inertial imaging of spatially
patterned annular mass distributions of a circular graphene nanodrum resonator.
By placing two distinct analytes in concentric annular regions, we harness the
vibrational mode-specific sensitivities of the nanodrum to estimate their
respective mass densities. An analytical formulation based on the Rayleigh-Ritz
principle is developed to relate radial mass loading to modal frequency shifts.
Finite element simulations are performed in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the
shifts in the resonance frequency of vibrational modes under varying
geometrical configurations of annular rings. By processing these frequency
shifts through a transformation matrix, we estimate the concomitant mass
distributions of annular rings. The results indicate that the estimation errors
are lower for analytes placed near the antinodal regions of the dominant
vibration mode, with the lowest error being 1.82 % for analyte A and 2.03 % for
analyte B. Furthermore, thinner annular rings demonstrate enhanced detection
accuracy due to reduced modal overlap. This study demonstrates an analytical
strategy for mass detection using a graphene nanodrum by providing insights
into optimal analyte placement and structural design for high-precision
multi-target mass sensing applications.

Abstract: Recent developments dedicated to the building of multiscale mechanical and
chemical constitutive laws for energetic molecular crystals are presented and
discussed. In particular, various tools have been specifically incorporated in
molecular dynamics codes to facilitate the subsequent information transfer to
the continuum, i.e. finite elements simulation codes. Atomistic simulations
have been augmented with the capability to follow specific deformation paths as
well as local Lagrangian mechanical metrics, enabling the computation of
materials flow stress surface. This mechanistic library allowed the
construction of a comprehensive non-linear hyperelastic continuum model
including crystal plasticity and twinning for TATB. Besides, recent advances in
analyzing reactive molecular dynamics simulations with unsupervised learning
algorithms has enabled the identification and calibration of chemical
decomposition kinetics for RDX and TATB single crystal. In the present work,
the procedure is applied to $\beta$-HMX and extended with the calibration of a
multi-components equation of state. These two ingredients are implemented in a
finite-element code in order to model the shock-to-detonation transition at the
mesoscale level and to study dimensionality effects in quasi-static hotspots.
Finally, these dedicated efforts towards a comprehensive multiscale modeling of
explosives has also given rise to the need for new prospective experiments,
discussed throughout the paper.

Conclusion: 为抑制材料不稳定性和创造新型有机量子材料奠定了基础。

Abstract: Peierls theorem postulates that a one-dimensional (1D) metallic chain must
undergo a metal-to-insulator transition via lattice distortion, resulting in
bond length alternation (BLA) within the chain. The validity of this theorem
has been repeatedly proven in practice, as evidenced by the absence of a
metallic phase in low-dimensional atomic lattices and electronic crystals,
including conjugated polymers, artificial 1D quantum nanowires, and anisotropic
inorganic crystals. Overcoming this transition enables realizing long-sought
organic quantum phases of matter, including 1D synthetic organic metals and
even high-temperature organic superconductors. Herein, we demonstrate that the
Peierls transition can be globally suppressed by employing lattice topology
engineering of classic trans-polyacetylene chains connected to open-shell
nanographene terminals. The appropriate topology connection enables an
effective interplay between the zero-energy modes (ZMs) of terminal and the
finite odd-membered polyacetylene (OPA) chains. This creates a critical
topology-defined highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that compensates for
bond density variations, thereby suppressing BLA and reestablishing their
quasi-1D metallic character. Moreover, it also causes the formation of an
unconventional boundary-free resonance state, being delocalized over the entire
chain with non-decaying spectral weight, distinguishing them from traditional
solitons observed in polyacetylene. Our finding sets the stage for pioneering
the suppression of material instability and the creation of synthetic organic
quantum materials with unconventional quantum phases previously prohibited by
the Peierls transition.

Abstract: Measuring entanglement entropy in interacting, multipartite systems remains a
significant experimental challenge. We address this challenge by developing a
protocol to measure von Neumann entropy (VNE) and mutual information in quantum
transport systems with both many-body interactions and multiple subsystems. Our
analysis indicates that the vital connection between VNE and two-point
correlation functions persists under these realistic conditions. The
measurement is shown to be feasible for systems with boundary interactions and,
critically, for bulk-interacting systems subject to a quantum quench of their
internal couplings. Our work provides a pathway to experimentally quantify
entanglement in complex interacting systems and establishes mutual information
as an experimentally accessible indicator for system-environment entanglement.

Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides present compelling prospects
for next-generation low-power and high-frequency field-effect transistors.
However, scaling 2D TMD FETs into the sub-10 nm regime remains challenging due
to technical complexity. Moreover, short-channel effects in this length scale
are not yet fully understood. In this work, we investigate the transport
properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm,
using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green
function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an
effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a classical-to-quantum crossover
in electron transport during transistor downscaling, governed by two critical
temperatures: Tc, which marks the crossover from thermionic emission to quantum
tunneling, and Tt, beyond which thermionic emission dominates and the
subthreshold swing approaches its classical limit. The shortest 3 nm junction
exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold
swing superior to the Boltzmann tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence
of the transmission coefficient. This quantum-tunneling-enhanced switching
behavior demonstrates the potential of ultra-scaled 2D FETs to surpass
classical efficiency constraints, offering a promising route toward
energy-efficient, quantum-enabled computing technologies. This study presents a
predictive, atomistic methodology for quantifying quantum transport and
identifies the transition in electron transport mechanisms from semiclassical
thermionic current in long-channel to quantum tunneling in short-channel 2D TMD
FETs, offering critical design insights for leveraging quantum-classical hybrid
transistor technology.

Abstract: Three-wave scattering is a fascinating phenomenon with many applications in
various technologies. Reducing the system symmetry greatly affects three-wave
scattering, which, in this case, goes beyond the simple momentum conservation
law. In this study, we examine three-magnon scattering at the edge of a thin
ferromagnetic film, when a bulk spin wave interacts with an edge-localized
propagating spin-wave upon the reflection. This creates new bulk spin waves at
mixed frequencies by means of three-magnon confluence or stimulated splitting
processes. Using our developed analytical theory, which has been confirmed by
full micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that the amplitude of the wave
generated in the stimulated splitting process is several times larger than that
generated in the confluence process, primarily due to the lower group velocity.
Furthermore, intensity of inelastically scattered waves exhibit a pronounced
dependence on the incidence angle and frequency of the edge spin wave that goes
beyond existing qualitative models. We show that the observed behaviors can
only be explained by taking into account, that the scattered waves are created
by several elementary three-magnon processes involving the incident and
reflected waves. The complex nature of the scattered wave creation results in a
strong sensitivity of its amplitude to the phase accumulation of spin waves
upon reflection.

Abstract: Heterostructures of normal metals (N) and magnetic insulators (F) show
paradigmatic effects, such as spin-Hall magnetoresistance and electric drag
currents. These effects are linear in the applied electric field $E(\omega)$.
Normal-metal $-$ magnetic-insulator heterostructures also exhibit a
characteristic nonlinear response quadratic in $E(\omega)$, referred to as
unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance or spin-torque diode effect. In this
article, we develop a theory of the bilinear response of FN bilayers and NFN
trilayers for finite frequencies $\omega$ of the driving field and for four
contributions that have been previously considered in the literature: Joule
heating, phonon-mediated unidirectional magnetoresistance, the spin-torque
diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall magnetoresistance. We
identify their distinct dependencies on frequency and the magnetization
direction of the magnetic insulator and examine their scaling with magnetic
field and system geometry, providing a framework for experimental
differentiation.

Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from
ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent frontier in
condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear
magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings
with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts
exhibiting odd-parity spin splitting remain largely unexplored. Here, based on
symmetry argument, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be
induced from collinear antiferromagnets. Remarkably, using effective model
analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly
polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices induces
both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet
odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced
antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed
Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of
MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new
class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced
magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.
