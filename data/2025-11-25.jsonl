In the single-particle framework, we introduce the one-particle irreducible 1PI effective action formalism taking explicitly into account the choice of the initial quantum state, its saddle-point plus Gaussian fluctuation approximation, and its finite temperature extension via Matsubara summation. This yields a clear physical interpretation in terms of zero-point and thermal contributions to the Helmholtz free energy. The formalism is then applied to the GP action producing the 1PI effective potential at zero and finite temperature including beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang and thermal corrections. We discuss the gapless and gapped Bogoliubov spectra, their relevance to equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, and the role of regularization. Applications include the inclusion of an external potential within the local density approximation, the derivation of finite-temperature Josephson equations, and the extension to D dimensional systems. This unified approach provides a transparent connection between microscopic quantum fluctuations and effective macroscopic equations of motion for Bose-Einstein condensates."}

In this work, we propose and numerically demonstrate the realization of the Josephson diode effect in an atomtronic circuit consisting of a ring-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate and with optical barriers serving as Josephson junctions. Our implementation of this macroscopic non-reciprocal quantum phenomenon is based on realizing the required inversion symmetry breaking through asymmetric barrier placement and an asymmetric alternating current (AC) drive, enabling position- and drive-tunable diode effects with efficiencies up to 15% and 91%, respectively. While standard time-of-flight absorption imaging can readily observe these effects, we employ cavity optomechanics for in situ, real-time, and non-destructive measurements of the relevant condensate dynamics. Our results establish a highly tunable platform for nonreciprocal Josephson transport, opening avenues for diode-based neutral-atom technologies in future quantum circuits."}

Here, we investigate a new approach that uses Rydberg impurities as a spectroscopic sensor of the surrounding strongly correlated state of ultracold paired fermions. The extended wavefunction of the Rydberg electron induces a finite-range potential that can bind atoms from the BCS medium, forming molecular states. As a consequence, the optical absorption spectrum of the impurity encodes key many-body properties. Using the functional determinant approach, we provide a direct measure of the superfluid gap through frequency shifts of dimer and trimer peaks. The spectra also reveal whether the Cooper pairs are broken or trapped intact. For static Rydberg atoms, we relate this signature of pairing to the suppression of the orthogonality catastrophe due to the superconducting gap resulting in the formation of well-defined polaron quasiparticles. Our work establishes Rydberg atom spectroscopy as a powerful local probe of strongly correlated matter."}

Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe2 and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe2, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices."}

On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon."}

Distributions of the coupled exponentials include the Pareto Types I-IV and Gosset's Student-t. For the Pareto Type II distribution, the Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy has a linear dependence on the shape, which dominates over the logarithmic dependence on the scale, motivating the need for a generalization. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies are shown to be of historic importance but ultimately unsatisfactory generalizations. The coupled entropy of the coupled stretched exponential distribution isolates the nonlinear-shape dependence to a generalized logarithm of the partition function. The Rényi and Tsallis entropies retain a strong dependence on the nonlinear-shape such that they are not equivalent to the uncertainty at the scale. Lemmas for the composability and extensivity of the coupled entropy are proven in support of an axiomatic definition.

Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly in regard to the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. Without loss of generality, the proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor model, known for its predictive capability and adaptability to fit a large number of resistance switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences, that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor state.

Tunneling spectroscopy in CsBi2 reveals a nearly fully opened superconductivity gap. The ratio of 2Δ/kBTC = 4.7 suggests relatively strong coupling superconductivity, as compared with that in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs). In contrast to the previous study categorizing CsBi2 as a type-I superconductor, the applied magnetic field induces a hexagonal vortex lattice in which each vortex core exhibits an intriguing three-fold symmetry state. In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence.

Direct numerical simulations and self-consistent mode-coupling theory reveal that the anomaly originates from giant, long-range nonequilibrium fluctuations amplified by the imposed gradient. While linear theory predicts a divergent dissipation in the inviscid limit, nonlinear mode coupling regularizes the divergence, yielding a finite anomalous dissipation.

This results in weakly coupled competing sectors whose eigenvalue competition produces abrupt crossovers without nonanalyticity, a mechanism we term nearly block-diagonal irreducible. A key thermodynamic signature of such pseudotransitions is that the residual entropy at the interface remains bounded between the residual entropies of the competing sectors. We develop a general spectral framework to describe this behavior and apply it to two representative models: the Ising chain with internal degeneracy (Doniach model) and a hexagonal nanowire chain with mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 components.

In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments."}

In this framework, the overlap matrix between two corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is derived from diagonalizing the real-space Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. The pass-ordered product of overlap matrices around the BZ boundary forms a Wilson loop, and defines the Chern number in real space. It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization. By contrast, the phase diagram is almost unaffected by polarized disorder, indicating that nontrivial topology persists against disorder. These observations are supported by the linear conductance and the density of bulk states."}

From the steady mean-squared velocity, we define a kinetic temperature and a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation whose violation vanishes in two limits: large mass or large chirality, identifying chirality as an additional route to equilibrium-like behavior. The steady-state velocity excess kurtosis gives a phase map that exhibits a (Gaussian-like)-active(bimodal)-(Gaussian-like) re-entrance with mass; chirality confines activity and shrinks the active sector.

Here, we design a practically realizable tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. This model respects eight-fold rotational and chiral symmetries, resulting in a higher-order topological phase with eight zero-energy corner modes that have no crystalline counterparts.

Our approach block encodes the exact expression for the second derivative of the energy and uses quantum linear systems algorithms to deal with the reciprocal powers of the gaps that appear in the expression. We further show that if prior knowledge about the values of the second derivative is used then our algorithm can $ε$-approximate the entropy using a number of queries that scales with the condition number $κ$, the temperature $T$, error tolerance $ε$ and an analogue of the partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$, as $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{Z}κ^2 }{εT}\\right)$.

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."}

While such noise is pervasive, its overall impact on activated transitions between metastable states remains unclear, despite prior studies of specific noise forms and scaling limits. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for Lévy noise defined by its finite intensity and independent stationary increments. By identifying the most probable transition paths as minimizers of a stochastic action functional, we derive analytical scaling laws for escape rates under weak noise, thereby extending the classical Arrhenius law. Our results demonstrate that Lévy noise universally enhances escape efficiency by reducing the effective potential barrier compared to Gaussian noise with equivalent intensity. Strikingly, even vanishingly weak Lévy noise can exponentially increase escape rates across a broad range of amplitude distributions. This phenomenon arises from discontinuous most probable transition paths, where escape occurs via finite jumps. We validate these paths through the cumulant-generating function, a path integral representation, the mean first passage time and numerical simulations.

For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets.

Here we introduce a laterally excited high overtone thickness shear bulk acoustic resonator, abbreviated as X HTBAR, that overcomes these limitations through a fully planar excitation scheme. The X HTBAR employs a 3 micron thick 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric film on a 500 micron high resistivity silicon substrate, enabling efficient excitation of thickness shear modes through lateral electrodes without the need for bottom electrodes and confining the acoustic field between the top electrodes. This configuration removes parasitic loss channels, increases energy transfer efficiency to greater than ninety nine percent, and provides a stable free spectral range of about 5.75 MHz with very small fluctuations. Experimental measurements show comb like phonon spectra spanning 0.1 to 1.8 GHz, high quality factors in the range of ten to the power of three to ten to the power of five, frequency quality products larger than ten to the power of thirteen at room temperature, and a low temperature coefficient of frequency. In addition, a gridded electrode design together with the intrinsic properties of 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3, including insensitivity to electrode spacing and a large electromechanical coupling coefficient, suppresses spurious modes and allows tunable mode volumes from 0.008 to 0.064 cubic millimeters.

While the non-Bloch polarization $P_β$ defined on the generalized Brillouin zone restores momentum-space topology, a direct, robust real-space bulk probe has remained elusive. We resolve this by establishing a universal correspondence between $P_β$ and the entanglement polarization $χ$ of the biorthogonal ground state. Introducing a quasi-reciprocal Hamiltonian $\\tilde{H}$ that removes the NHSE while preserving bulk topology, we rigorously prove the fundamental identity $P_β \\equiv χ(\\tilde{H})\\pmod 1$ in the thermodynamic limit under the quasi-locality assumption. Crucially, we demonstrate that this equivalence transcends the locality constraints that limit traditional topological invariants. While the conventional Resta polarization fails when $\\tilde{H}$ becomes non-local due to the divergence of position variance, we reveal that $χ(\\tilde{H})$ remains robustly quantized, protected by the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators. Our work thus identifies entanglement as the unique real-space diagnostic capable of capturing non-Bloch topology beyond the breakdown of locality, successfully restoring the BBC across diverse non-Hermitian systems such as line-gap, point-gap, and gapless phases, thereby unifying the geometric and entanglement paradigms in non-Hermitian physics."}

We further demonstrate how the KPZ-type scaling governs the large-deviation behavior and survival probability near the boundary in the hyperbolic domain, and how Lifshitz tails arise naturally in a deterministic large-deviation landscape on the hyperbolic plane via instanton approach, reproducing the rare-event statistics of one-dimensional diffusion in the array of traps with the Poisson distribution.

It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $β$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $β$ where sign problems occur.

Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions. While conventional skyrmions exhibit a dominant $σ_z$ component with weak dipolar $σ_x, σ_y$ contributions, spin-flux skyrmions possess an additional monopolar $σ_x$ component that yields a finite average emergent field for a finite density of skyrmions. This nontrivial component introduces a nontrivial term in the Hall conductivity, enabling a direct explanation of experimental Hall resistivity anomalies that cannot be accounted for by conventional skyrmions alone. Moreover, we show that this additional term couples to the in-plane spin polarization of conduction electrons, providing a further tunable handle to control the transverse Hall response."}

Here, we examine the performance and limitations of the LMC measure in a controlled physical setting: a two-dimensional XY model studied through Monte Carlo simulations. By computing LMC complexity at each step of the system's relaxation dynamics, and directly comparing these values with the evolving dipole configurations, we show that LMC complexity systematically fails to identify states of high structural complexity. In particular, the measure often assigns maximal complexity to nearly equilibrated configurations while underestimating vortex-rich intermediate states. We further show that the time derivative of LMC complexity contains more meaningful dynamical information.

Unlike previous studies, which typically allowed for one single value of $K$ or sometimes a small assortment of fixed values, here a tiling may concomitantly employ $K$-mers comprising any number $K$ of cells, provided a maximality constraint is satisfied. In essence, this constraint requires each of the $K$-mers in use to be as lengthy as possible, given its surroundings in the resulting tiling. Maximality aims to limit the variety of possible tilings while allowing for interesting behavior in terms of the statistical physical observables of interest. In fact, by introducing an energy function based on cell contacts and parameterizing it appropriately, we have been able to observe relatively unexpected behavior, including the suggestion of phase transitions as the system's temperature evolves."}

They are defined as the maximum classical relative entropy or Rényi relative entropy realizable by performing a measurement on $ρ$ and $σ$, and they have interpretations in terms of asymptotic quantum hypothesis testing. Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators. In this paper, we establish foundational properties of these objective functions by analyzing their matrix gradients and Hessian superoperators; namely, we prove that these objective functions are $β$-smooth and $γ$-strongly convex / concave, where $β$ and $γ$ depend on the max-relative entropies of $ρ$ and $σ$. A practical consequence of these properties is that we can conduct Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent / ascent, a well known classical optimization technique, to calculate the measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy to arbitrary precision. These algorithms are generally more memory efficient than our previous algorithms based on semi-definite optimization [Huang and Wilde, arXiv:2406.19060], and for well conditioned states $ρ$ and $σ$, these algorithms are notably faster."}

The recently developed time-dependent double coupled-cluster (TD-dCC) ansatz achieves this by combining correlation effects from the N- and (N-1)-electron sectors, but its exact formulation remains computationally demanding. Here we introduce a hierarchy of cost-effective approximate TD-dCC ansatzes derived from truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansions, which preserve a single-similarity-transformation structure while retaining the essential correlation diagrams responsible for satellite formation. We further develop a detailed component analysis that isolates hole-mediated excitation pathways, which are correlated processes arising from the coupling between ground-state and ionized-state amplitudes. We use it to interpret quasiparticle and satellite features across the hierarchy. Applications to the single-impurity Anderson model and molecular systems (H2O and CH4) demonstrate that the approximate TD-dCC methods closely and efficiently reproduce exact many-body spectral features and quasiparticle weights. In parallel, we construct a fault-tolerant quantum signal processing algorithm for the core-hole Green's function, providing a scalable quantum route for simulating correlated core-level dynamics.

Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware.

We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume. Our work thus establishes a direct link between linear-response properties and many-body entanglement."}

However, the resultant states only approach Fock states and therefore do not exhibit quantum coherence. Here we overcome this limitation using a minimal step: a nonlinear phase-insensitive absorption process added to the linear one. The coherent addition of such individually passive processes allows coherence to emerge and increase in phase space without an external drive and with minimal interaction requirements. The coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states emerges because the linear and nonlinear absorption processes are not mutually passive. In the simplest case rotationally symmetric Wigner functions of the oscillator Fock states convert their many negative regions to an extremely complex asymmetric structure in sharp contrast to the rotational symmetry of those obtained by the individual interactions. We extend this case to include an unsaturable absorber (oscillator) and analyse switching between linear and nonlinear absorptions, suitable for broad classes of experiments."}

By deriving the system Hamiltonian under the rotating-wave approximation and employing a Lindblad master equation to rigorously model dissipation, we analyze the complete dynamical evolution of the battery. Our study demonstrates that strong, resonant light-matter interactions are crucial for enhancing the key performance metrics: charging efficiency, stored energy, and ergotropy (extractable work). We systematically investigate the deleterious effects of detuning and decoherence, and critically, we uncover a non-trivial interplay between the system's coupling strengths.

When AEQSs are controlled by 1qqaf's, it suffices in essence to find an optimal 1qqaf that approximately solves a target relational problem. For this purpose, we develop a basic idea of approximately utilizing well-known quantum algorithms for quantum counting, quantum amplitude estimation, and quantum approximation. We then provide a rough estimation of the efficiency of our quantum learning algorithms for AEQSs."}

In this article, we extend fractional calculus to explore a particle in a periodic potential, where the Schrödinger equation is generalized to its fractional form. This framework allows us to study how the Lévy index $q$ governs the formation and inversion of energy bands, offering a pathway to engineer new physical behaviors and device functionalities by tuning $q$ in periodic quantum systems. We solve the fractional Schrödinger equation for periodic rectangular potentials of varying height $V_0$, barrier thickness $L$, and well width $W$ using an imaginary-time evolution algorithm, and supplement the discrete energy dispersion through Gaussian process regression. Our analysis reveals a qualitative shift in the band structure at $q=2$, separating into regimes for $q>2$ and $q<2$. For $q > 2$, energy bands undergo an inverting transformation as symmetric minima emerge within the first Brillouin zone, shifting from $k=0$ toward $k=\\pm π/a$ with increasing $q$. These degenerate minima define a Bloch-momentum qubit, suggesting an analog to valley degrees of freedom used in valleytronics. The response of the ground band scales with fractional order as $V_0^{-0.28\\pm0.05}L^{-0.34\\pm0.08}W^{-0.49\\pm0.06}$, indicating tunable sensitivity to geometry. For $q < 2$, the effective mass near $k = 0$ decreases exponentially with $q$, yielding a universal effective mass of $0.15\\pm0.01$ as $q \\to 1$, demonstrating that the Lévy index serves as a tunable degree of freedom capable of driving band inversion, modulating the band gap, and reshaping carrier dynamics."}

Our investigations are based on the principle idea of the Eckert 1991 protocol and utilize the secret key capacity introduced by Devetak and Winter in 2005. Our results include a proof on what measurement bases need to be chosen to achieve this capacity for the case of Werner states. It also presents a new processing strategy and compares it with the most common one that can be found within the literature. Furthermore, it answers the question on how much entanglement distillation is optimal. By doing so we propose a unified formalism, describing the whole processing chain, that can be used to make quantitative statements on the relation between the quality and quantity of entangled but noisy quantum states used for generating secure keys."}

The synchronized dynamics is independent of initial conditions and features entanglement among spins within each motif.

Leveraging the flexibility and robustness of optimal control theory combined with underlying insights from effective Hamiltonian theory, we present a new family of broadband DNP pulse sequences, termed LOOP (Longitudinally Optimized with Overarching Periodicity), that alleviates the excitation-pulse challenge by accomplishing longitudinal polarization transfer. These sequences define robust single-spin effective $z$ rotations, with impressive compensation towards microwave field inhomogeneity, and are capable of delivering DNP transfer with bandwidths exceeding 100 MHz, while employing a peak microwave field amplitude of only 32 MHz, at an external magnetic field of 0.35 T."}

Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.\n  This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era.

To our knowledge, this is only the second time that an ontological model has been constructed for an entire theory, rather than just for some particular scenarios within a theory. This result refutes a conjecture from doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.052216 which suggested that there might be no local-realist ontological model for bilocal classical theory. Moreover, it is the first time that an ontological model has been constructed for a theory that fails to be locally tomographic, showing that the assumption of local tomography underpinning the structure theorem in doi.org/10.22331/q-2024-03-14-1283 is a genuine limitation of the theorem. This demonstrates that in general there is no tension between failures of local tomography and classical explainability (i.e., generalised noncontextuality). In fact, bilocal classical theory is in many ways more simply understood via the underlying ontological model than it is within its original formulation (much as how odd-dimensional stabiliser subtheories can be more simply understood via Spekkens' toy theory). Furthermore, this result naturally leads to the question, does every locally-classical theory admit of an ontological model? By constructing a concrete counterexample, we show that this is not the case. Our findings demonstrate that there is no straightforward relationship between theories being locally-classical, and them being classically-explainable. This shows that the fundamental status of compositional properties (such as local tomography) is not a technical side-issue, but a central and unavoidable question for a coherent understanding even of classicality itself."}

Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|Θ(\\mathcal{U})|d/ε^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $Θ(\\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $ε$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|Θ(\\mathcal{U})|\\mathrm{polylog}(d)/ε^2)$.

We then introduce the effect of dark counts and demonstrate how to quantify the minimum required efficiency to observe a desired CHSH violation with an increasing dark count error. Finally, to obtain an analytical closed-form expression of the minimum efficiency, we consider the set of no-signaling behaviors that satisfy the Tsirelson bound, which are easier to characterize than the quantum set. Using such behaviors, we find a simple closed-form expression for a lower bound on the minimum efficiency which is monotonically increasing with the CHSH violation, though the analytically obtained lower bounds are meaningfully below the numerically tight lower bound."}

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."}
