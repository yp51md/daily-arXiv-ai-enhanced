### [1] [Aperiodic Dissipation as a Mechanism for Steady-State Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15108)
*Shilpi Roy,Jiangbin Gong*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了非周期性耗散如何诱导稳态局域化，挑战了传统认为耗散导致退相干的观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为耗散会破坏量子系统的相干性，但研究发现工程化耗散可以促进量子效应。本文旨在探索非周期性耗散如何独立于哈密顿量中的无序或准周期势，诱导稳态局域化。

Method: 通过比较两类非周期性耗散（可公度和不可公度情况），分析其对稳态局域化的影响，使用相干性度量、纯度和参与比等工具。

Result: 不可公度调制在稳定局域化稳态中效果最佳，耗散通过长程相位关联主动塑造局域化而非仅导致退相干。

Conclusion: 非周期性耗散是控制开放量子系统中局域化的有效方法，为操纵量子态和设计耗散驱动相提供了新途径。

Abstract: Dissipation is traditionally regarded as a disruptive factor in quantum
systems because it often leads to decoherence and delocalization. However,
recent insights into engineered dissipation reveal that it can be tuned to
facilitate various quantum effects, from state stabilization to phase
transitions. In this work, we identify aperiodic dissipation as a mechanism for
inducing steady-state localization, independent of disorder or a quasiperiodic
potential in the Hamiltonian. This localization arises from long-range phase
correlations introduced by a spatially varying dissipation phase parameter,
which enables nontrivial interference in the steady-state. By systematically
comparing two classes of aperiodic dissipation (defined as commensurate and
incommensurate cases), we find that incommensurate modulation plays the most
efficient role in stabilizing a localized steady-state. Our analysis, based on
coherence measures, purity, and participation ratio, reveals a direct link
between eigenstate coherence and real-space localization, showing that
dissipation can actively shape localization rather than simply causing
decoherence. These findings highlight aperiodic dissipation as a viable
approach to controlling localization in open quantum systems, potentially
enabling new ways to manipulate quantum states and design dissipation-driven
phases.

### [2] [Comparative Analysis of QNN Architectures for Wind Power Prediction: Feature Maps and Ansatz Configurations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14795)
*Batuhan Hangun,Emine Akpinar,Oguz Altun,Onder Eyecioglu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）结合量子计算与机器学习，旨在通过量子力学原理提升经典方法。本研究评估量子神经网络（QNNs）在风能数据集上的表现，证明其优于经典方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管QML潜力巨大，但当前NISQ设备的限制引发对其实际优势的质疑。本研究旨在验证QNNs的有效性。

Method: 构建并评估12种QNN配置，结合两种量子特征映射和六种纠缠策略，在风能数据集上进行实验。

Result: 使用Z特征映射的QNNs在预测风能输出时达到93%准确率，优于经典方法。

Conclusion: QNNs在预测任务中表现优异，展示了QML在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

### [3] [CutReg: A loss regularizer for enhancing the scalability of QML via adaptive circuit cutting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14858)
*Maniraman Periyasamy,Christian Ufrecht,Daniel D. Scherer,Wolfgang Mauerer*

Main category: quant-ph

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子机器学习（QML）是否具有优势仍是一个开放问题，而NISQ硬件的限制（如电路深度和连接性）阻碍了验证量子优势和解决诸如贫瘠高原等主要障碍。

Method: 引入一种新的正则化项到QML优化过程中，直接惩罚与采样相关的开销，以平衡电路切割的优势与典型机器学习成本函数的优化。

Result: 该方法能够优化器在减少切割开销的同时保持QML模型的整体准确性，从而为研究更大复杂问题铺平道路。

Conclusion: 通过平衡切割开销与模型准确性，该方法为探索量子优势提供了新途径。

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a cornerstone
of computational drug discovery. This research demonstrates the successful
application of a Quantum Multiple Kernel Learning (QMKL) framework to enhance
QSAR classification, showing a notable performance improvement over classical
methods. We apply this methodology to a dataset for identifying DYRK1A kinase
inhibitors. The workflow involves converting SMILES representations into
numerical molecular descriptors, reducing dimensionality via Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), and employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained
on an optimized combination of multiple quantum and classical kernels. By
benchmarking the QMKL-SVM against a classical Gradient Boosting model, we show
that the quantum-enhanced approach achieves a superior AUC score, highlighting
its potential to provide a quantum advantage in challenging cheminformatics
classification tasks.

### [5] [Recent solution to the Casimir puzzle awaits its experimental confirmation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14955)
*V. M. Mostepanenko,G. L. Klimchitskaya*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文讨论了卡西米尔谜题的可能解决方案，指出耗散Drude模型不适用于横向电衰减波区域，但在传播波和横向磁极化衰减波中仍适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Drude模型在横向电衰减波区域与实验数据矛盾的问题，并验证其在其他区域的适用性。

Method: 通过计算传播波和横向磁极化衰减波中的卡西米尔力，并比较石墨烯的双极点特性，提出假设。

Result: Drude模型在横向电衰减波区域不适用，但在其他区域与实验数据一致；石墨烯的双极点特性可能解释了等离子体模型在该区域的适用性。

Conclusion: Drude模型在特定区域不适用，双极点特性可能是等离子体模型成功的原因，需进一步实验验证。

Abstract: The plausible resolution of the Casimir puzzle implying that the dissipative
Drude model is not applicable in the area of transverse electric evanescent
waves is discussed. Calculations show that for the propagating waves, as well
for the evanescent waves with transverse magnetic polarization, the Drude model
can beused in calculations of the Casimir force by the Lifshitz theory with no
contradictions with the measurement data. The lateral component of magnetic
field of the magnetic dipole oscillating near a metallic surface is computed
for the parameters of experiment in preparation which is aimed to directly
check the validity of the Drude model in the area of transverse electric
evanescent waves. By comparing with the case of graphene, whose dielectric
response is spatially nonlocal and possesses the double pole at zero frequency,
it is hypothesized that the success of the dissipationless plasma model in this
area is also caused by the presence of a double pole.

### [6] [Long-Range Entangling Operations via Josephson Junction Metasurfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14958)

Method: 利用超表面作为可重构耦合介质，通过设计的传输系数确定相互作用强度，研究了通过超表面共振驱动的iSWAP门和几何相位积累的控制相位门实现两比特相互作用。

Result: 模拟显示在厘米级距离上保持超过98%的纠缠保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架为远距离量子比特的高保真纠缠操作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present a framework for implementing two-qubit entangling operations
between distant superconducting qubits using a space-time modulated Josephson
junction metasurface. By modulating the surface in both space and time, we
engineer sidebands with controllable wavevectors that selectively couple target
qubits. The metasurface acts as a reconfigurable coupling medium, where the
interaction strength is determined by engineered transmission coefficients
rather than by exponentially decaying near-field coupling, thus reducing the
dependence on physical proximity. We investigated the implementation of
two-qubit interactions via iSWAP gates driven resonantly through the
metasurface and controlled phase gates via geometric phase accumulation.
Simulations show entangling fidelity exceeding 98% maintained over centimeter
scale separations.

Abstract: In this article we revisit objectivity conditions for the quantum Brownian
motion (QBM) model only under the recoilless (Born-Oppenheimer) limit. We
clarify the previous results for the objectivity study under what conditions
the objectivity is achieved, especially how a trajectory of a central
oscillator influences objectivity and why the objectivity is enhanced the phase
get closer to $\pi/2$. We show that the finite number of environmental
oscillators can have the objectivity only with respect to the associated time
scales defined by frequency relation between a central oscillator and
environmental oscillators. We study possible frequency relations for the
objectivity and the associated time scales.

Abstract: Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and
general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various
experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved
spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects
such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and
theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian
gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock
interferometry configuration designed to detect the gravitational field of a
rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could mediate
entanglement between quantum systems. Due to the symmetry of the configuration,
the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but
remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Assuming the validity of the
quantum equivalence principle, this approach may provide insights not only into
the quantum nature of gravity but also into whether spacetime itself exhibits
quantum properties. However, our analysis reveals that, within realistic
experimental parameters, the expected effects are too small to be detected. We
discuss possible interpretations of this undetectability, and its implications
for tests of quantum gravity.

Result: 上下文性是非经典性的充分但不必要条件；提出了一种无需上下文性即可表现非经典性的量子实验；简化了测量配置以验证上下文性。

Conclusion: 量子系统的性质可通过投影生成器捕捉，简化测量配置可验证上下文性。

Abstract: Quantum contextuality is known as the fundamental feature of quantum
mechanics. It is not clear whether contextuality fully reveals the nonclassical
aspects of quantum mechanics. To answer this question, we propose a
mathematical framework based on logic algebra to compare classical and quantum
experiments. With the framework, we precisely characterize the contextuality
and nonclassicality, reveal that the former is a sufficient but not necessary
condition for the latter, and present a type of quantum experiments which
exhibit nonclassicality without contextuality. We also point out that the
property of quantum systems is captured by the projector generators. Therefore,
it is possible to witness quantum contextuality with simplified measurement
configurations. For example, we show that 12 projectors witness the
Kochen-Specker contextuality, and 3 measurements are sufficient to witness the
quantum contextuality, as compared to the 4 presented in the compatibility
graph approach.

Abstract: The impact of local von Neumann measurements on quantum battery capacity is
investigated in tripartite quantum systems. Two measurement-based protocols are
proposed and the concept of optimal local projective operators is introduced.
Specifically, explicit analytical expressions are derived for the protocols
when applied to general three-qubit X-states. Furthermore, the negative effects
of white noise and dephasing noise on quantum battery capacity are analyzed,
proving that optimal local projective operators can improve the robustness of
subsystem and total system capacity against both noise types for the general
tripartite X-state. The performance of different schemes in capacity
enhancement are numerically validated through detailed examples and it is found
that these optimized operators can effectively enhance both subsystem and total
system battery capacity. The results indicate that the local von Neumann
measurement is a powerful tool to enhance the battery capacity in multipartite
quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum coherence is one of the most basic characteristics of quantum
mechanics. Here we give some methods to detect and measure quantum coherence.
Firstly, we propose a coherence criterion without full quantum state tomography
based on partial transposition. Moreover, we present a coherent nonlinear
detection strategy from witnesses, in which we find that for some coherent
states, normal witness detection fails but our nonlinear detection succeeds. In
addition, we prove that when the nonlinear detection on the two copies of the
coherent state fails, the nonlinear detection on the three copies may be
successful. Finally, due to the difficulty in calculating robustness of
coherence for general states, we introduce a lower bound for coherent
robustness based on the witness operator, and after comparing our lower bound
with the currently known lower bound, one show that our lower bound is better.
Coherence is believed to play a crucial role in quantum information tasks,
making the detection and quantization of coherence particularly significant.
Therefore, these results help to open up new avenues for advancement in quantum
theory.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum computing (NAQC) offers distinct advantages such as
dynamic qubit reconfigurability, long coherence times, and high gate
fidelities, making it a promising platform for scalable quantum computing.
Despite these strengths, efficiently implementing quantum circuits like the
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) remains a significant challenge due to atom
movement overheads and connectivity constraints. This paper introduces optimal
compilation strategies tailored to QFT circuits and NAQC systems, addressing
these challenges for both linear and grid-like architectures. By minimizing
atom movements, the proposed methods achieve theoretical lower bounds in atom
movements while preserving high circuit fidelity. Comparative evaluations
against state-of-the-art compilers demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed methods. These methods could serve as benchmarks for evaluating the
performance of NAQC compilers.

Conclusion: 该架构降低了实现容错的要求，为近期量子硬件实现提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Topological quantum codes are intrinsically fault-tolerant to local noise,
and underlie the theory of topological phases of matter. We explore geometry to
enhance the performance of topological quantum codes by rotating the four
dimensional self-correcting quantum memory, and present codes targeted to both
near-term and utility-scale quantum computers. We identify a full set of
logical Clifford operations and with it design a universal fault-tolerant
quantum architecture. Our design achieves single-shot error correction,
significant reductions in required qubits, and low-depth logical operations. In
turn, our proposed architecture relaxes the requirements for achieving fault
tolerance and offers an efficient path for realization in several near-term
quantum hardware implementations. Our [[96,6,8]] 4D Hadamard lattice code has
low weight-6 stabilizers and depth-8 syndrome extraction circuits, a high
pseudo-threshold of $\sim 0.01$, and a logical error rate of $\sim 10^{-6}$ per
logical qubit per round of error correction at $10^{-3}$ physical error rate
under a standard circuit-level noise model. A Clifford-complete logical gate
set is presented, including a constructive and efficient method for Clifford
gate synthesis.

### [14] [Catalytic $z$-rotations in constant $T$-depth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15147)
*Isaac H. Kim*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that the $T$-depth of any single-qubit $z$-rotation can be reduced to
$3$ if a certain catalyst state is available. To achieve an
$\epsilon$-approximation, it suffices to have a catalyst state of size
polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$. This implies that
$\mathsf{QNC}^0_f/\mathsf{qpoly}$ admits a finite universal gate set consisting
of Clifford+$T$. In particular, there are catalytic constant $T$-depth circuits
that approximate multi-qubit Toffoli, adder, and quantum Fourier transform
arbitrarily well. We also show that the catalyst state can be prepared in time
polynomial in $\log (1/\epsilon)$.

entangle remote superconducting qubits via microwave-optical transduction using
multi-time-bin states. By adapting conventional entanglement swapping
techniques, fidelity improves from 0.75 to $0.98$ in transduction systems, and
0.66 to 0.89 in noisy channels. The protocol mitigates thermal noise without
relying on purification and offers a practical path toward scalable,
heterogeneous quantum systems.

Abstract: Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in
fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted
attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet
interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely
positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a
systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to
features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown
of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting
with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system
violates angular momentum conservation despite the rotational symmetry of the
underlying equations of motion.

Result: 不确定性关系在纯态下紧致，完全描述了双参数估计精度的量子极限。

Conclusion: 通过操纵多维参数空间的几何结构，可以有效解决多参数估计的挑战。

Abstract: Quantum multiparameter estimation aims to simultaneously estimate multiple
parameters from observing quantum systems and data processing. The complexity
of quantum multiparameter estimation arises primarily from measurement
incompatibility and parameter correlations. By manipulating the
multidimensional parameter space, we derive an estimation uncertainty relation
that captures the impact of measurement incompatibility and parameter
correlation on quantum two-parameter estimation. This uncertainty relation is
tight for pure states and completely describes the quantum limit of
two-parameter estimation precision. We also develop an error ellipse method to
intuitively illustrate the impact of the uncertainty relation and apply it to
the phase-space complex displacement estimation. Our research shows that
multiparameter estimation challenges can be effectively addressed by
manipulating the geometry of multidimensional parameter space.

Teleportation Protocol (WITP). We commence by constructing an analog of a
traversable wormhole utilizing the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in conjunction
with the Thermofield Double (TFD) state framework, implemented within a quantum
circuit. Subsequently, we manipulate various parameters, including temperature
($\beta$) and the location of the message qubit, and compare the fidelity
result with that of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)-based
wormhole-inspired teleportation protocol. Our findings demonstrate that the
SYK-based protocol achieves a higher fidelity of states in comparison to the
TFIM counterpart. We further analyze the protocol for different values of
$\beta$ and the SWAP operator. These findings are attributed to the emergence
of random matrix ensembles via random phase theory within the dynamics of the
SYK model, which is characterized by pronounced chaotic behavior. A significant
outcome of our investigation is initializing the message as a two-qubit Bell
state, followed by teleportation across the system. We introduce a Pauli
stabilizer-based fidelity measure to diagnose the teleportation
characteristics. This yields a considerable enhancement in fidelity relative to
the single-qubit variant of the protocol. Finally, we analyze the temporal
fluctuation of fidelity for both single-qubit and two-qubit message across the
channel, contributing to a deeper understanding of quantum teleportation
dynamics.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ans\"atze for solving
variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance.
Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge,
impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the
effective rank, denoted as $\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of
expressivity. Specifically, $\kappa$ captures the number of effectively
independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized
quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to
expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture,
input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that
$\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an
$n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This
result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and
quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights,
and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design
space, we employ $\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of
highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a
reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent
that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating
theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes
$\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the
effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum
circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN
architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine
learning.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅恢复了NMR中的定制脉冲序列，还进一步扩展了其在复杂量子系统中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a well-known open-loop protocol for suppressing
unwanted interactions in a quantum system, thereby drastically extending the
coherence time of useful quantum states. In the original framework of evolution
symmetrization, a DD sequence was shown to enforce a symmetry on the unwanted
Hamiltonian, thereby suppressing it if the symmetry was inaccessible. In this
work, we show how symmetries already present in the undesired Hamiltonian can
be harnessed to reduce the complexity of decoupling sequences and to construct
nested protocols that correct dominant errors at shorter timescales, using the
factorization of DD symmetry groups into a product of its subgroups. We provide
many relevant examples in various spin systems, using the Majorana
constellation and point-group factorization to identify and exploit symmetries
in the interaction Hamiltonian. Our framework recovers tailored pulse sequences
developed in the context of NMR and further produces novel short and robust
sequences capable of suppressing on-site disorder, dipole-dipole interactions,
and more exotic many-body interactions in spin ensembles.

Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum information processing, it is crucial to
develop high-efficiency and broadband quantum memory of squeezed light, which
enables the storage of full-bandwidth information. Here, we present a quantum
memory of squeezed light with up to 24 MHz bandwidth, which is at least 12
times that of previous narrowband resonant memory systems, via a far-off
resonant Raman process. We achieve output squeezing of as high as 1.0 dB with
fidelity above 92% and a memory efficiency of 80%, corresponding to an
end-to-end efficiency of 64.2%, when input squeezing is 1.6 dB. The lowest
excess noise of 0.025 shot-noise-unit in the memory system is estimated by the
noisy channel model which is benefited from optimizing quantum memory
performance with a backward retrieval strategy. Our results represent a
breakthrough in high-performance memory for squeezed states within tens of
MHz-level bandwidth, which has potential applications in high-speed quantum
information processing.

Abstract: Amplitude damping is a dominant source of error in high performance quantum
processors. A promising approach in quantum error correction is erasure error
conversion, where errors are converted into detectable leakage states.
Dual-rail encoding has been shown as a candidate for the conversion of
amplitude-damping errors; with unique sensitivities to noise and decoherence
sources. Here we present a dual-rail encoding within a single fixed-frequency
superconducting multimode transmon qubit. The three island, two junction device
comprises two transmonlike modes with a detuning of 0.75-1 GHz, in a coaxial
circuit QED architecture. We show the logical bit-flip and phase-flip error
rates are more than one order of magnitude lower than the physical error rates,
and demonstrate stability and repeatability of the architecture through an
extended measurement of three such devices. Finally, we discuss how the
error-detected subspace can be used for investigations into the fundamentals of
noise and decoherence in fixed-frequency transmon qubits.

Abstract: We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable
efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio
electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a
correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation
amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of
magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error
in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible
system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these
estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase
in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these
approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence
that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from
these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to
consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled
cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum
embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable
self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of
quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate
the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.

Conclusion: 该方法为Rydberg原子接收器在卫星通信中的应用提供了重要突破。

Abstract: Rydberg-atom receivers aim for ultra-high sensitivity to microwave fields
through various techniques, but receiving satellite signals has remained a
significant challenge, due to the difficulty of capturing weak microwaves over
long distances. In this work, we introduce a high-gain antenna to focus
satellite signals, and then apply into an atomic cell via a microwave cavity.
Using microwave-enhanced coupling, the minimum detectable power of incident
microwave is down to -128 dBm, and the corresponding sensitivity is estimated
as 21 nV/cm/Hz1/2 at frequency of 3.80 GHz. Furthermore, beacon signal from
geostationary satellites is captured with Rydberg sensors for the first time,
without the need for a low-noise amplifier. And C-band modulated signals are
read out with a signal-to-noise ratio of 8 dB. Our results mark a significant

Result: 数值模拟验证了方法的有效性，提高了精度且未显著增加门数。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了随机编译的应用范围，解决了无界哈密顿项强度量化问题。

Abstract: Randomized compilation protocols have recently attracted attention as
alternatives to traditional deterministic Trotter-Suzuki methods, potentially
reducing circuit depth and resource overhead. These protocols determine gate
application probabilities based on the strengths of Hamiltonian terms, as
measured by the trace norm. However, relying solely on the trace norm to define
sampling distributions may not be optimal, especially for continuous-variable
and hybrid-variable systems involving unbounded operators, where quantifying
Hamiltonian strengths is challenging. In this work, we propose an adaptive
randomized compilation algorithm that dynamically updates sampling weights via
low-order moment measurements of Hamiltonian terms, assigning higher
probabilities to terms with greater uncertainty. This approach improves
accuracy without significantly increasing gate counts and extends randomized
compilation to continuous-variable and hybrid-variable systems by addressing
the difficulties in characterizing the strengths of unbounded Hamiltonian
terms. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: The universality of quantum theory has been questioned ever since it was
proposed. Key to this long-unsolved question is to test whether a given
physical system has non-classical features. Here we connect recently proposed
witnesses of non-classicality, based on information-theoretic ideas, with the
theory of temporal entanglement. We provide a protocol to witness the
non-classicality of a system by probing it with a qubit: we show that, assuming
a general conservation law, violating temporal Bell inequalities on the qubit
probe implies the non-classicality of the system under investigation. We also
perform proof-of-principle experimental emulations of the proposed witness of
non-classicality, using a three qubit Nuclear Magnetic Resonance quantum
computer. Our result is robust, as it relies on minimal assumptions, and
remarkably it can be applied in a broad range of contexts, from quantum biology
to quantum gravity.

Abstract: In this manuscript we discuss the relationship between the gate time of
Rydberg two-qubit gate and the Rydberg interaction strength. Different from the
two-qbuit gates that directly depend on the interactions between the spins (or
pseudo spins), the ones in atomic arrays are realized by driving the atoms to
the Rydberg states. As a consequence, competition happens between shortening
the gate time and decreasing the excitation probability of Rydberg states. For
the case of Rydberg blockade, it is found that the gate time is irrelevant of
the Rydberg interaction strength. In contrast, for the case of weak Rydberg
interactions, the interactions will help to accelerate the two-qubit gates.
This implies that the scheme of weak Rydberg interactions will be faster than
the Rydberg blockade one to realize the two-qbuit gates under the same Rabi
frequencies of Rydberg excitation. Through using the geometric control under
the region of weak Rydberg interaction, fast and robust two-qubit gates can be
achieved in atomic arrays, of which detailed discussion can be referred to the
manuscript \textsl{arXiv:2412. 19193 (2024)}.

Abstract: Surface codes are promising for practical quantum error correction due to
their high threshold and experimental feasibility. However, their performance
under realistic noise conditions, particularly those involving correlated
errors, requires further investigation. In this study, we investigate the
impact of correlated errors on the error threshold. In particular, we focus on
several distinct types of correlated errors that could potentially arise from
next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) coupling in quantum systems. We present the
analytical threshold of the surface code under these types of correlated noise,
and find that errors correlated along straight lines possess a type of crucial
symmetry, resulting in higher thresholds compared to other types of correlated
errors. This deepens our insight into the threshold of surface code and hence
facilitates a more robust design of quantum circuits with a higher noise
threshold.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has
been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous
implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are
susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and
polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin
encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD
systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in
conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been
experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD
system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source
operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully
demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120
km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of
continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of
integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a
telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key
rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development
signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and
scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology

Conclusion: 激子-极化子凝聚体为研究二维非平衡普适性提供了可靠平台，并为探索远离平衡的量子系统相干性开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally
different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class
in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from
equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium
counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental
evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far.
Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ
universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of
light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium
conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as
space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across
microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct
lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling
exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results
establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for
exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues
for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far
from equilibrium.

Conclusion: 无限寄存器不增强${\sf QMA}$能力，但可实现完美完备性；高效放大器显著提升完备性。

Abstract: A long-standing open problem in quantum complexity theory is whether ${\sf
QMA}$, the quantum analogue of ${\sf NP}$, is equal to ${\sf QMA}_1$, its
one-sided error variant. We show that ${\sf QMA}={\sf QMA}^{\infty}= {\sf
QMA}_1^{\infty}$, where ${\sf QMA}_1^\infty$ is like ${\sf QMA}_1$, but the
verifier has an infinite register, as part of their witness system, in which
they can efficiently perform a shift (increment) operation. We call this
register an ``infinite counter'', and compare it to a program counter in a Las
Vegas algorithm. The result ${\sf QMA}={\sf QMA}^\infty$ means such an infinite
register does not increase the power of ${\sf QMA}$, but does imply perfect
completeness.
  By truncating our construction to finite dimensions, we get a ${\sf
QMA}$-amplifier that only amplifies completeness, not soundness, but does so in
significantly less time than previous ${\sf QMA}$ amplifiers. Our new
construction achieves completeness $1-2^{-q}$ using $O(1)$ calls to each of the
original verifier and its inverse, and $O(\log q)$ other gates, proving that
${\sf QMA}$ has completeness doubly exponentially close to 1, i.e. ${\sf
QMA}={\sf QMA}(1-2^{-2^r},2^{-r})$ for any polynomial $r$.

Abstract: Bosons and fermions are defined by their exchange properties and the
underlying symmetries determine the structure of the corresponding state
spaces. For two particles there are two possible exchange symmetries, resulting
in symmetric or antisymmetric behaviour, but when exploring multiparticle
systems also quantum states with chiral symmetries appear. In this work we
demonstrate that chiral symmetries lead to extremal forms of quantum
entanglement. More precisely, we show that subspaces with this symmetry are
highly entangled with respect to the geometric measure of entanglement, leading
to observables which can be useful for entanglement characterization. Along the
way, we develop a simple method to solve the problem of genuine multiparticle
entanglement for unitarily invariant three-particle states and use it to
identify genuine multipartite entangled states whose partial transposes with
respect to all bipartitions are positive. Finally, we consider generalizations
with less symmetry and discuss potential applications.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors are a promising platform for scalable quantum
computing. An obstacle to implementing deep quantum circuits is managing atom
loss, which constitutes a significant fraction of all errors. Current
approaches are either not capable of replacing lost atoms in the middle of a
circuit -- and therefore restricted to fixed, short circuit depths -- or
require more than an order of magnitude longer time than gate and measurement
operations to do so. In this work, we demonstrate fast, continuous atom
replacement leveraging the metastable $^{171}$Yb qubit. A continuously loaded
reservoir near the computation zone enables on-demand atom extraction with
tweezers up to 500 times per second. New qubit arrays can be prepared 30 times
per second when including single-atom preparation, non-destructive imaging and
initialization. Importantly, existing qubits are completely undisturbed by the
reloading process, owing to the extreme isolation of the metastable qubit from
cooling and imaging light. This work establishes a complete foundation for
implementing fast quantum circuits with unlimited depth, removing a final
roadblock for fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用量子错误简并性提升解码性能的方法，在低密度奇偶校验码中实现了接近量子哈希界限的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子纠错是实现可扩展量子计算的关键，而低密度奇偶校验码因其结构稀疏性和与迭代解码算法的兼容性表现出色。

Method: 通过显式利用量子错误的简并性，提升解码性能，并在去极化通道上进行仿真验证。

Result: 在编码率为1/3时，方法在物理错误率为9.45%的情况下，实现了低至$10^{-4}$的帧错误率，接近量子哈希界限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了简并性在缩小量子纠错与基本极限之间差距中的关键作用。

Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for realizing scalable quantum
computation. Among various approaches, low-density parity-check codes over
higher-order Galois fields have shown promising performance due to their
structured sparsity and compatibility with iterative decoding algorithms whose
computational complexity scales linearly with the number of physical qubits. In
this work, we demonstrate that explicitly exploiting the degeneracy of quantum
errors can significantly enhance the decoding performance. Simulation results
over the depolarizing channel indicate that the proposed method, at a coding
rate of 1/3, achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-4}$ at a physical
error rate of 9.45% for a code with 104,000 logical qubits and 312,000 physical
qubits, approaching the quantum hashing bound. These findings highlight the
critical role of degeneracy in closing the gap to the fundamental limits of
quantum error correction.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了连续两次相同相位压缩操作下参数估计的可行性，提出通过相位变换优化估计精度，并比较了联合估计与逐步估计的优劣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续两次相同相位压缩操作导致量子统计模型失效，无法可靠估计参数，因此需要探索优化方法以提高估计精度。

Method: 在两次压缩操作之间引入相位变换以减少模型失效，并分析其对估计精度的影响。同时比较联合估计与逐步估计的精度界限。

Result: 通过优化的相位变换，联合估计在精度上仍优于逐步估计，且通用检测方法在某些情况下可接近最优精度。

Conclusion: 适当的相位变换能有效减少模型失效，联合估计在噪声环境下仍具优势，为参数估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: When two successive squeezing operations with the same phase are applied to a
field mode, reliably estimating the amplitude of each is impossible because the
output state depends solely on their sum. In this case, the quantum statistical
model becomes sloppy, and the quantum Fisher information matrix turns singular.
However, estimation of both parameters becomes feasible if the quantum state is
subjected to an appropriate scrambling operation between the two squeezing
operations. In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of a phase-shift
scrambling transformation, optimized to reduce sloppiness and maximize the
overall estimation precision. We also compare the optimized precision bounds of
joint estimation with those of stepwise estimation methods, finding that joint
estimation retains an advantage despite the quantum noise induced by the
residual parameter incompatibility. Finally, we analyze the precision
achievable by general-dyne detection and find that it may approach the optimal
precision in some regimes.

Conclusion: 研究结果为随机化LCU算法在哈密顿模拟和本征态制备中的应用提供了新的工具和方法。

Abstract: Randomisation is widely used in quantum algorithms to reduce the number of
quantum gates and ancillary qubits required. A range of randomised algorithms,
including eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian
simulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed
for different applications, share common features in the use of unitary
decomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by
analysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in
quantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the
randomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the
resulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an
unphysical form $U \rho V^\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore,
randomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the
expectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a
quantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose
feature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly
suitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an
unbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U \rho V^\dagger$ and
its generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the
state prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our
results reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and
shadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables
efficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the
simulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian
simulation and eigenstate preparation tasks.

Motivation: 研究波函数分支的精确定义，以扩展退相干理论并替代量子公理中的人为中心测量，同时探索其在高效经典模拟中的潜力。

Method: 比较了Taylor & McCulloch和Weingarten的两种方法，前者基于干扰与区分分支的复杂度差异，后者通过最小化加权复杂度与熵来定义分支。

Result: 两种方法均表明分支因状态复杂度的线性增长而持久存在，但各有优缺点。

Conclusion: 提出了可解决的开放性问题，并讨论了两种方法的适用性与局限性。

Abstract: Under unitary evolution, a typical macroscopic quantum system is thought to
develop wavefunction branches: a time-dependent decomposition into orthogonal
components that (1) form a tree structure forward in time, (2) are approximate
eigenstates of quasiclassical macroscopic observables, and (3) exhibit
effective collapse of feasibly measurable observables. If they could be defined
precisely, wavefunction branches would extend the theory of decoherence beyond
the system-environment paradigm and could supplant anthropocentric measurement
in the quantum axioms. Furthermore, when such branches have bounded
entanglement and can be effectively identified numerically, sampling them would
allow asymptotically efficient classical simulation of quantum systems. I
consider a promising recent approach to formalizing branches on the lattice by
Taylor & McCulloch [Quantum 9, 1670 (2025), arXiv:2308.04494], and compare it
to prior work from Weingarten [Found. Phys. 52, 45 (2022), arXiv:2105.04545].
Both proposals are based on quantum complexity and argue that, once created,
branches persist for long times due to the generic linear growth of state
complexity. Taylor & McCulloch characterize branches by a large difference in
the unitary complexity necessary to interfere vs. distinguish them. Weingarten
takes branches as the components of the decomposition that minimizes a weighted
sum of expected squared complexity and the Shannon entropy of squared norms. I
discuss strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, and identify tractable
open questions.

Conclusion: 为近期量子平台提供了一种资源高效且可扩展的量子相位估计框架。

Abstract: Eigenvalue estimation is a central problem for demonstrating quantum
advantage, yet its implementation on digital quantum computers remains limited
by circuit depth and operational overhead. We present an analog quantum phase
estimation (aQPE) protocol that extracts the eigenenergies of a target
Hamiltonian via continuous time evolution and single-mode cavity measurement.
By encoding eigenvalue information as conditional cavity phase-space rotations,
the scheme avoids deep quantum circuits and entangling gates, while enabling
readout through established cavity tomography techniques. We further illustrate
the feasibility of this approach by engineering a Hamiltonian that implements
aQPE of the XY model, whose ground-state energy problem is QMA-complete, within
a physical architecture compatible with existing circuit quantum
electrodynamics technology. Our results provide a resource-efficient and
scalable framework for implementing quantum phase estimation in near-term
quantum platforms.

Motivation: 传统认为耗散会破坏量子系统，但研究发现工程化耗散可促进量子效应，本文旨在探索非周期性耗散对局域化的作用。

Method: 通过比较两类非周期性耗散（可公度和不可公度），分析其对稳态局域化的影响，使用相干性、纯度和参与比等指标。

Result: 不可公度调制在稳定局域化稳态中效果最佳，耗散可通过长程相位相关性主动塑造局域化。

Conclusion: 非周期性耗散是控制开放量子系统中局域化的有效方法，为操纵量子态和设计耗散驱动相提供了新途径。

Abstract: Dissipation is traditionally regarded as a disruptive factor in quantum
systems because it often leads to decoherence and delocalization. However,
recent insights into engineered dissipation reveal that it can be tuned to
facilitate various quantum effects, from state stabilization to phase
transitions. In this work, we identify aperiodic dissipation as a mechanism for
inducing steady-state localization, independent of disorder or a quasiperiodic
potential in the Hamiltonian. This localization arises from long-range phase
correlations introduced by a spatially varying dissipation phase parameter,
which enables nontrivial interference in the steady-state. By systematically
comparing two classes of aperiodic dissipation (defined as commensurate and
incommensurate cases), we find that incommensurate modulation plays the most
efficient role in stabilizing a localized steady-state. Our analysis, based on
coherence measures, purity, and participation ratio, reveals a direct link
between eigenstate coherence and real-space localization, showing that
dissipation can actively shape localization rather than simply causing
decoherence. These findings highlight aperiodic dissipation as a viable
approach to controlling localization in open quantum systems, potentially
enabling new ways to manipulate quantum states and design dissipation-driven
phases.

Conclusion: QNNs在预测任务中表现优异，展示了QML在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of
quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine
learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as
entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the
practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns
by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired
counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their
effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and
evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum
feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz
design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs
employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when
forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings
show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring
the potential of QML in real-world applications.

Result: 该方法能够权衡切割开销与模型精度，为研究更大复杂问题以实现量子优势铺平道路。

Conclusion: 通过正则化项平衡采样开销与模型精度，为QML在更大问题中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Whether QML can offer a transformative advantage remains an open question.
The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and
connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical
investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting
techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on
smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However,
this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the
expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to
estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel
regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the
overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables
the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the
optimization of the typical ML cost function. Specifically, it navigates the
trade-off between minimizing the cutting overhead and maintaining the overall
accuracy of the QML model, paving the way to study larger complex problems in
pursuit of quantum advantage.

Conclusion: Drude模型在横向电消失波区域的失败可能与其缺少双极点有关。

Abstract: The plausible resolution of the Casimir puzzle implying that the dissipative
Drude model is not applicable in the area of transverse electric evanescent
waves is discussed. Calculations show that for the propagating waves, as well
for the evanescent waves with transverse magnetic polarization, the Drude model
can beused in calculations of the Casimir force by the Lifshitz theory with no
contradictions with the measurement data. The lateral component of magnetic
field of the magnetic dipole oscillating near a metallic surface is computed
for the parameters of experiment in preparation which is aimed to directly
check the validity of the Drude model in the area of transverse electric
evanescent waves. By comparing with the case of graphene, whose dielectric
response is spatially nonlocal and possesses the double pole at zero frequency,
it is hypothesized that the success of the dissipationless plasma model in this
area is also caused by the presence of a double pole.

Abstract: We present a framework for implementing two-qubit entangling operations
between distant superconducting qubits using a space-time modulated Josephson
junction metasurface. By modulating the surface in both space and time, we
engineer sidebands with controllable wavevectors that selectively couple target
qubits. The metasurface acts as a reconfigurable coupling medium, where the
interaction strength is determined by engineered transmission coefficients
rather than by exponentially decaying near-field coupling, thus reducing the
dependence on physical proximity. We investigated the implementation of
two-qubit interactions via iSWAP gates driven resonantly through the
metasurface and controlled phase gates via geometric phase accumulation.
Simulations show entangling fidelity exceeding 98% maintained over centimeter

Abstract: Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and
general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various
experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved
spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects
such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and
theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian
gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock
interferometry configuration designed to detect the gravitational field of a
rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could mediate
entanglement between quantum systems. Due to the symmetry of the configuration,
the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but
remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Assuming the validity of the
quantum equivalence principle, this approach may provide insights not only into
the quantum nature of gravity but also into whether spacetime itself exhibits
quantum properties. However, our analysis reveals that, within realistic
experimental parameters, the expected effects are too small to be detected. We
discuss possible interpretations of this undetectability, and its implications
for tests of quantum gravity.

Abstract: Quantum contextuality is known as the fundamental feature of quantum
mechanics. It is not clear whether contextuality fully reveals the nonclassical
aspects of quantum mechanics. To answer this question, we propose a
mathematical framework based on logic algebra to compare classical and quantum
experiments. With the framework, we precisely characterize the contextuality
and nonclassicality, reveal that the former is a sufficient but not necessary
condition for the latter, and present a type of quantum experiments which
exhibit nonclassicality without contextuality. We also point out that the
property of quantum systems is captured by the projector generators. Therefore,
it is possible to witness quantum contextuality with simplified measurement
configurations. For example, we show that 12 projectors witness the
Kochen-Specker contextuality, and 3 measurements are sufficient to witness the
quantum contextuality, as compared to the 4 presented in the compatibility
graph approach.

Abstract: The impact of local von Neumann measurements on quantum battery capacity is
investigated in tripartite quantum systems. Two measurement-based protocols are
proposed and the concept of optimal local projective operators is introduced.
Specifically, explicit analytical expressions are derived for the protocols
when applied to general three-qubit X-states. Furthermore, the negative effects
of white noise and dephasing noise on quantum battery capacity are analyzed,
proving that optimal local projective operators can improve the robustness of
subsystem and total system capacity against both noise types for the general
tripartite X-state. The performance of different schemes in capacity
enhancement are numerically validated through detailed examples and it is found
that these optimized operators can effectively enhance both subsystem and total
system battery capacity. The results indicate that the local von Neumann
measurement is a powerful tool to enhance the battery capacity in multipartite

Abstract: Quantum coherence is one of the most basic characteristics of quantum
mechanics. Here we give some methods to detect and measure quantum coherence.
Firstly, we propose a coherence criterion without full quantum state tomography
based on partial transposition. Moreover, we present a coherent nonlinear
detection strategy from witnesses, in which we find that for some coherent
states, normal witness detection fails but our nonlinear detection succeeds. In
addition, we prove that when the nonlinear detection on the two copies of the
coherent state fails, the nonlinear detection on the three copies may be
successful. Finally, due to the difficulty in calculating robustness of
coherence for general states, we introduce a lower bound for coherent
robustness based on the witness operator, and after comparing our lower bound
with the currently known lower bound, one show that our lower bound is better.
Coherence is believed to play a crucial role in quantum information tasks,
making the detection and quantization of coherence particularly significant.
Therefore, these results help to open up new avenues for advancement in quantum
theory.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum computing (NAQC) offers distinct advantages such as
dynamic qubit reconfigurability, long coherence times, and high gate
fidelities, making it a promising platform for scalable quantum computing.
Despite these strengths, efficiently implementing quantum circuits like the
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) remains a significant challenge due to atom
movement overheads and connectivity constraints. This paper introduces optimal
compilation strategies tailored to QFT circuits and NAQC systems, addressing
these challenges for both linear and grid-like architectures. By minimizing
atom movements, the proposed methods achieve theoretical lower bounds in atom
movements while preserving high circuit fidelity. Comparative evaluations
against state-of-the-art compilers demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed methods. These methods could serve as benchmarks for evaluating the
performance of NAQC compilers.

Abstract: Topological quantum codes are intrinsically fault-tolerant to local noise,
and underlie the theory of topological phases of matter. We explore geometry to
enhance the performance of topological quantum codes by rotating the four
dimensional self-correcting quantum memory, and present codes targeted to both
near-term and utility-scale quantum computers. We identify a full set of
logical Clifford operations and with it design a universal fault-tolerant
quantum architecture. Our design achieves single-shot error correction,
significant reductions in required qubits, and low-depth logical operations. In
turn, our proposed architecture relaxes the requirements for achieving fault
tolerance and offers an efficient path for realization in several near-term
quantum hardware implementations. Our [[96,6,8]] 4D Hadamard lattice code has
low weight-6 stabilizers and depth-8 syndrome extraction circuits, a high
pseudo-threshold of $\sim 0.01$, and a logical error rate of $\sim 10^{-6}$ per
logical qubit per round of error correction at $10^{-3}$ physical error rate
under a standard circuit-level noise model. A Clifford-complete logical gate
set is presented, including a constructive and efficient method for Clifford
gate synthesis.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that the $T$-depth of any single-qubit $z$-rotation can be reduced to
$3$ if a certain catalyst state is available. To achieve an
$\epsilon$-approximation, it suffices to have a catalyst state of size
polynomial in $\log(1/\epsilon)$. This implies that
$\mathsf{QNC}^0_f/\mathsf{qpoly}$ admits a finite universal gate set consisting
of Clifford+$T$. In particular, there are catalytic constant $T$-depth circuits
that approximate multi-qubit Toffoli, adder, and quantum Fourier transform
arbitrarily well. We also show that the catalyst state can be prepared in time
polynomial in $\log (1/\epsilon)$.

0.66 to 0.89 in noisy channels. The protocol mitigates thermal noise without

Abstract: Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in
fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted
attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet
interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely
positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a
systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to
features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown
of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting
with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system
violates angular momentum conservation despite the rotational symmetry of the
underlying equations of motion.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过操纵多维参数空间的几何结构，可以有效解决多参数估计的挑战。

Abstract: Quantum multiparameter estimation aims to simultaneously estimate multiple
parameters from observing quantum systems and data processing. The complexity
of quantum multiparameter estimation arises primarily from measurement
incompatibility and parameter correlations. By manipulating the
multidimensional parameter space, we derive an estimation uncertainty relation
that captures the impact of measurement incompatibility and parameter
correlation on quantum two-parameter estimation. This uncertainty relation is
tight for pure states and completely describes the quantum limit of
two-parameter estimation precision. We also develop an error ellipse method to
intuitively illustrate the impact of the uncertainty relation and apply it to
the phase-space complex displacement estimation. Our research shows that
multiparameter estimation challenges can be effectively addressed by
manipulating the geometry of multidimensional parameter space.

Abstract: This study aims to provide insights into various aspects of quantum chaos and
teleportation by implementing the recently developed Wormhole-Inspired
Teleportation Protocol (WITP). We commence by constructing an analog of a
traversable wormhole utilizing the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model in conjunction
with the Thermofield Double (TFD) state framework, implemented within a quantum
circuit. Subsequently, we manipulate various parameters, including temperature
($\beta$) and the location of the message qubit, and compare the fidelity
result with that of the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)-based
wormhole-inspired teleportation protocol. Our findings demonstrate that the
SYK-based protocol achieves a higher fidelity of states in comparison to the
TFIM counterpart. We further analyze the protocol for different values of
$\beta$ and the SWAP operator. These findings are attributed to the emergence
of random matrix ensembles via random phase theory within the dynamics of the
SYK model, which is characterized by pronounced chaotic behavior. A significant
outcome of our investigation is initializing the message as a two-qubit Bell
state, followed by teleportation across the system. We introduce a Pauli
stabilizer-based fidelity measure to diagnose the teleportation
characteristics. This yields a considerable enhancement in fidelity relative to
the single-qubit variant of the protocol. Finally, we analyze the temporal
fluctuation of fidelity for both single-qubit and two-qubit message across the
channel, contributing to a deeper understanding of quantum teleportation
dynamics.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are widely employed as ans\"atze for solving
variational problems, where their expressivity directly impacts performance.
Yet, accurately characterizing QNN expressivity remains an open challenge,
impeding the optimal design of quantum circuits. In this work, we introduce the
effective rank, denoted as $\kappa$, as a novel quantitative measure of
expressivity. Specifically, $\kappa$ captures the number of effectively
independent parameters among all the variational parameters in a parameterized
quantum circuit, thus reflecting the true degrees of freedom contributing to
expressivity. Through a systematic analysis considering circuit architecture,
input data distributions, and measurement protocols, we demonstrate that
$\kappa$ can saturate its theoretical upper bound, $d_n=4^n-1$, for an
$n$-qubit system when each of the three factors is optimally expressive. This
result provides a rigorous framework for assessing QNN expressivity and
quantifying their functional capacity. Building on these theoretical insights,
and motivated by the vast and highly structured nature of the circuit design
space, we employ $\kappa$ as a guiding metric for the automated design of
highly expressive quantum circuit configurations. To this end, we develop a
reinforcement learning framework featuring a self-attention transformer agent
that autonomously explores and optimizes circuit architectures. By integrating
theoretical characterization with practical optimization, our work establishes
$\kappa$ as a robust tool for quantifying QNN expressivity and demonstrates the
effectiveness of reinforcement learning in designing high-performance quantum
circuits. This study paves the way for building more expressive QNN
architectures, ultimately enhancing the capabilities of quantum machine
learning.

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) is a well-known open-loop protocol for suppressing
unwanted interactions in a quantum system, thereby drastically extending the
coherence time of useful quantum states. In the original framework of evolution
symmetrization, a DD sequence was shown to enforce a symmetry on the unwanted
Hamiltonian, thereby suppressing it if the symmetry was inaccessible. In this
work, we show how symmetries already present in the undesired Hamiltonian can
be harnessed to reduce the complexity of decoupling sequences and to construct
nested protocols that correct dominant errors at shorter timescales, using the
factorization of DD symmetry groups into a product of its subgroups. We provide
many relevant examples in various spin systems, using the Majorana
constellation and point-group factorization to identify and exploit symmetries
in the interaction Hamiltonian. Our framework recovers tailored pulse sequences
developed in the context of NMR and further produces novel short and robust
sequences capable of suppressing on-site disorder, dipole-dipole interactions,
and more exotic many-body interactions in spin ensembles.

Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum information processing, it is crucial to
develop high-efficiency and broadband quantum memory of squeezed light, which
enables the storage of full-bandwidth information. Here, we present a quantum
memory of squeezed light with up to 24 MHz bandwidth, which is at least 12
times that of previous narrowband resonant memory systems, via a far-off
resonant Raman process. We achieve output squeezing of as high as 1.0 dB with
fidelity above 92% and a memory efficiency of 80%, corresponding to an
end-to-end efficiency of 64.2%, when input squeezing is 1.6 dB. The lowest
excess noise of 0.025 shot-noise-unit in the memory system is estimated by the
noisy channel model which is benefited from optimizing quantum memory
performance with a backward retrieval strategy. Our results represent a
breakthrough in high-performance memory for squeezed states within tens of
MHz-level bandwidth, which has potential applications in high-speed quantum
information processing.

Dual-rail encoding has been shown as a candidate for the conversion of

Abstract: We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable
efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio
electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a
correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation
amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of
magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error
in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible
system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these
estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase
in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these
approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence
that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from
these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to
consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled
cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum
embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable
self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of
quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate
the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.

Conclusion: 该方法为Rydberg原子接收器在卫星通信中的应用提供了重要突破。

Abstract: Rydberg-atom receivers aim for ultra-high sensitivity to microwave fields
through various techniques, but receiving satellite signals has remained a
significant challenge, due to the difficulty of capturing weak microwaves over
long distances. In this work, we introduce a high-gain antenna to focus
satellite signals, and then apply into an atomic cell via a microwave cavity.
Using microwave-enhanced coupling, the minimum detectable power of incident
microwave is down to -128 dBm, and the corresponding sensitivity is estimated
as 21 nV/cm/Hz1/2 at frequency of 3.80 GHz. Furthermore, beacon signal from
geostationary satellites is captured with Rydberg sensors for the first time,
without the need for a low-noise amplifier. And C-band modulated signals are
read out with a signal-to-noise ratio of 8 dB. Our results mark a significant

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了随机编译的应用范围，解决了无界哈密顿项强度量化的难题。

Abstract: Randomized compilation protocols have recently attracted attention as
alternatives to traditional deterministic Trotter-Suzuki methods, potentially
reducing circuit depth and resource overhead. These protocols determine gate
application probabilities based on the strengths of Hamiltonian terms, as
measured by the trace norm. However, relying solely on the trace norm to define
sampling distributions may not be optimal, especially for continuous-variable
and hybrid-variable systems involving unbounded operators, where quantifying
Hamiltonian strengths is challenging. In this work, we propose an adaptive
randomized compilation algorithm that dynamically updates sampling weights via
low-order moment measurements of Hamiltonian terms, assigning higher
probabilities to terms with greater uncertainty. This approach improves
accuracy without significantly increasing gate counts and extends randomized
compilation to continuous-variable and hybrid-variable systems by addressing
the difficulties in characterizing the strengths of unbounded Hamiltonian
terms. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: The universality of quantum theory has been questioned ever since it was
proposed. Key to this long-unsolved question is to test whether a given
physical system has non-classical features. Here we connect recently proposed
witnesses of non-classicality, based on information-theoretic ideas, with the
theory of temporal entanglement. We provide a protocol to witness the
non-classicality of a system by probing it with a qubit: we show that, assuming
a general conservation law, violating temporal Bell inequalities on the qubit
probe implies the non-classicality of the system under investigation. We also
perform proof-of-principle experimental emulations of the proposed witness of
non-classicality, using a three qubit Nuclear Magnetic Resonance quantum
computer. Our result is robust, as it relies on minimal assumptions, and
remarkably it can be applied in a broad range of contexts, from quantum biology
to quantum gravity.

Abstract: In this manuscript we discuss the relationship between the gate time of
Rydberg two-qubit gate and the Rydberg interaction strength. Different from the
two-qbuit gates that directly depend on the interactions between the spins (or
pseudo spins), the ones in atomic arrays are realized by driving the atoms to
the Rydberg states. As a consequence, competition happens between shortening
the gate time and decreasing the excitation probability of Rydberg states. For
the case of Rydberg blockade, it is found that the gate time is irrelevant of
the Rydberg interaction strength. In contrast, for the case of weak Rydberg
interactions, the interactions will help to accelerate the two-qubit gates.
This implies that the scheme of weak Rydberg interactions will be faster than
the Rydberg blockade one to realize the two-qbuit gates under the same Rabi
frequencies of Rydberg excitation. Through using the geometric control under
the region of weak Rydberg interaction, fast and robust two-qubit gates can be
achieved in atomic arrays, of which detailed discussion can be referred to the
manuscript \textsl{arXiv:2412. 19193 (2024)}.

Abstract: Surface codes are promising for practical quantum error correction due to
their high threshold and experimental feasibility. However, their performance
under realistic noise conditions, particularly those involving correlated
errors, requires further investigation. In this study, we investigate the
impact of correlated errors on the error threshold. In particular, we focus on
several distinct types of correlated errors that could potentially arise from
next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) coupling in quantum systems. We present the
analytical threshold of the surface code under these types of correlated noise,
and find that errors correlated along straight lines possess a type of crucial
symmetry, resulting in higher thresholds compared to other types of correlated
errors. This deepens our insight into the threshold of surface code and hence
facilitates a more robust design of quantum circuits with a higher noise
threshold.

Conclusion: 该工作为基于固态单光子技术的稳健可扩展QKD网络提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has
been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous
implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are
susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and
polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin
encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD
systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in
conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been
experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD
system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source
operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully
demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120
km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of
continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of
integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a
telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key
rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development
signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and
scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology

Conclusion: 激子-极化激元凝聚体为研究二维非平衡普适性提供了可靠平台，并为探索远离平衡的量子系统相干性开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter can exhibit fundamentally
different behavior. A key example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class
in two spatial dimensions (2D KPZ), where microscopic deviations from
equilibrium give rise to macroscopic scaling laws without equilibrium
counterparts. While extensively studied theoretically, direct experimental
evidence of 2D KPZ scaling has remained limited to interface growth so far.
Here, we report the observation of universal scaling consistent with the KPZ
universality class in 2D exciton-polariton condensates -- quantum fluids of
light that are inherently driven and dissipative, thus breaking equilibrium
conditions. Using momentum-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as
space- and time-resolved interferometry, we probe the phase correlations across
microscopically different systems, varying drive conditions in two distinct
lattice geometries. Our analysis reveals correlation dynamics and scaling
exponents in excellent agreement with 2D KPZ predictions. These results
establish exciton-polariton condensates as a robust experimental platform for
exploring 2D nonequilibrium universality quantitatively, and open new avenues
for investigating the emergence of coherence in interacting quantum systems far
from equilibrium.

Motivation: 解决量子复杂性理论中长期存在的开放问题，即${\sf QMA}$是否等于其单侧误差变体${\sf QMA}_1$，并探索无限计数器的作用。

Method: 引入无限计数器作为验证系统的一部分，通过截断构造设计高效的${\sf QMA}$放大器，显著提升完备性。

Result: 证明了${\sf QMA}={\sf QMA}_1^\infty$，并展示了放大器在$O(1)$时间内将完备性提升至$1-2^{-q}$。

Conclusion: 无限计数器不影响${\sf QMA}$的能力，但实现了完美完备性，同时提供了一种高效的${\sf QMA}$放大器构造方法。

Abstract: A long-standing open problem in quantum complexity theory is whether ${\sf
QMA}$, the quantum analogue of ${\sf NP}$, is equal to ${\sf QMA}_1$, its
one-sided error variant. We show that ${\sf QMA}={\sf QMA}^{\infty}= {\sf
QMA}_1^{\infty}$, where ${\sf QMA}_1^\infty$ is like ${\sf QMA}_1$, but the
verifier has an infinite register, as part of their witness system, in which
they can efficiently perform a shift (increment) operation. We call this
register an ``infinite counter'', and compare it to a program counter in a Las
Vegas algorithm. The result ${\sf QMA}={\sf QMA}^\infty$ means such an infinite
register does not increase the power of ${\sf QMA}$, but does imply perfect
completeness.
  By truncating our construction to finite dimensions, we get a ${\sf
QMA}$-amplifier that only amplifies completeness, not soundness, but does so in
significantly less time than previous ${\sf QMA}$ amplifiers. Our new
construction achieves completeness $1-2^{-q}$ using $O(1)$ calls to each of the
original verifier and its inverse, and $O(\log q)$ other gates, proving that
${\sf QMA}$ has completeness doubly exponentially close to 1, i.e. ${\sf
QMA}={\sf QMA}(1-2^{-2^r},2^{-r})$ for any polynomial $r$.

Abstract: Bosons and fermions are defined by their exchange properties and the
underlying symmetries determine the structure of the corresponding state
spaces. For two particles there are two possible exchange symmetries, resulting
in symmetric or antisymmetric behaviour, but when exploring multiparticle
systems also quantum states with chiral symmetries appear. In this work we
demonstrate that chiral symmetries lead to extremal forms of quantum
entanglement. More precisely, we show that subspaces with this symmetry are
highly entangled with respect to the geometric measure of entanglement, leading
to observables which can be useful for entanglement characterization. Along the
way, we develop a simple method to solve the problem of genuine multiparticle
entanglement for unitarily invariant three-particle states and use it to
identify genuine multipartite entangled states whose partial transposes with
respect to all bipartitions are positive. Finally, we consider generalizations
with less symmetry and discuss potential applications.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors are a promising platform for scalable quantum
computing. An obstacle to implementing deep quantum circuits is managing atom
loss, which constitutes a significant fraction of all errors. Current
approaches are either not capable of replacing lost atoms in the middle of a
circuit -- and therefore restricted to fixed, short circuit depths -- or
require more than an order of magnitude longer time than gate and measurement
operations to do so. In this work, we demonstrate fast, continuous atom
replacement leveraging the metastable $^{171}$Yb qubit. A continuously loaded
reservoir near the computation zone enables on-demand atom extraction with
tweezers up to 500 times per second. New qubit arrays can be prepared 30 times
per second when including single-atom preparation, non-destructive imaging and
initialization. Importantly, existing qubits are completely undisturbed by the
reloading process, owing to the extreme isolation of the metastable qubit from
cooling and imaging light. This work establishes a complete foundation for
implementing fast quantum circuits with unlimited depth, removing a final
roadblock for fault-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.

Result: 在编码率为1/3时，帧错误率低至$10^{-4}$，接近量子哈希界。

Conclusion: 量子错误的简并性对缩小量子纠错与基本极限的差距至关重要。

Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for realizing scalable quantum
computation. Among various approaches, low-density parity-check codes over
higher-order Galois fields have shown promising performance due to their
structured sparsity and compatibility with iterative decoding algorithms whose
computational complexity scales linearly with the number of physical qubits. In
this work, we demonstrate that explicitly exploiting the degeneracy of quantum
errors can significantly enhance the decoding performance. Simulation results
over the depolarizing channel indicate that the proposed method, at a coding
rate of 1/3, achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-4}$ at a physical
error rate of 9.45% for a code with 104,000 logical qubits and 312,000 physical
qubits, approaching the quantum hashing bound. These findings highlight the
critical role of degeneracy in closing the gap to the fundamental limits of
quantum error correction.

Conclusion: 相位扰动操作能有效提升参数估计精度，联合估计方法在噪声环境下仍具优势。

Abstract: When two successive squeezing operations with the same phase are applied to a
field mode, reliably estimating the amplitude of each is impossible because the
output state depends solely on their sum. In this case, the quantum statistical
model becomes sloppy, and the quantum Fisher information matrix turns singular.
However, estimation of both parameters becomes feasible if the quantum state is
subjected to an appropriate scrambling operation between the two squeezing
operations. In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of a phase-shift
scrambling transformation, optimized to reduce sloppiness and maximize the
overall estimation precision. We also compare the optimized precision bounds of
joint estimation with those of stepwise estimation methods, finding that joint
estimation retains an advantage despite the quantum noise induced by the
residual parameter incompatibility. Finally, we analyze the precision
achievable by general-dyne detection and find that it may approach the optimal
precision in some regimes.

Abstract: Randomisation is widely used in quantum algorithms to reduce the number of
quantum gates and ancillary qubits required. A range of randomised algorithms,
including eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian
simulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed
for different applications, share common features in the use of unitary
decomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by
analysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in
quantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the
randomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the
resulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an
unphysical form $U \rho V^\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore,
randomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the
expectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a
quantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose
feature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly
suitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an
unbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U \rho V^\dagger$ and
its generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the
state prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our
results reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and
shadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables
efficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the
simulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian
simulation and eigenstate preparation tasks.

Conclusion: 论文指出了两种方法的优缺点，并提出了可解决的开放性问题，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Under unitary evolution, a typical macroscopic quantum system is thought to
develop wavefunction branches: a time-dependent decomposition into orthogonal
components that (1) form a tree structure forward in time, (2) are approximate
eigenstates of quasiclassical macroscopic observables, and (3) exhibit
effective collapse of feasibly measurable observables. If they could be defined
precisely, wavefunction branches would extend the theory of decoherence beyond
the system-environment paradigm and could supplant anthropocentric measurement
in the quantum axioms. Furthermore, when such branches have bounded
entanglement and can be effectively identified numerically, sampling them would
allow asymptotically efficient classical simulation of quantum systems. I
consider a promising recent approach to formalizing branches on the lattice by
Taylor & McCulloch [Quantum 9, 1670 (2025), arXiv:2308.04494], and compare it
to prior work from Weingarten [Found. Phys. 52, 45 (2022), arXiv:2105.04545].
Both proposals are based on quantum complexity and argue that, once created,
branches persist for long times due to the generic linear growth of state
complexity. Taylor & McCulloch characterize branches by a large difference in
the unitary complexity necessary to interfere vs. distinguish them. Weingarten
takes branches as the components of the decomposition that minimizes a weighted
sum of expected squared complexity and the Shannon entropy of squared norms. I
discuss strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, and identify tractable
open questions.

Abstract: Eigenvalue estimation is a central problem for demonstrating quantum
advantage, yet its implementation on digital quantum computers remains limited
by circuit depth and operational overhead. We present an analog quantum phase
estimation (aQPE) protocol that extracts the eigenenergies of a target
Hamiltonian via continuous time evolution and single-mode cavity measurement.
By encoding eigenvalue information as conditional cavity phase-space rotations,
the scheme avoids deep quantum circuits and entangling gates, while enabling
readout through established cavity tomography techniques. We further illustrate
the feasibility of this approach by engineering a Hamiltonian that implements
aQPE of the XY model, whose ground-state energy problem is QMA-complete, within
a physical architecture compatible with existing circuit quantum
electrodynamics technology. Our results provide a resource-efficient and
scalable framework for implementing quantum phase estimation in near-term

Abstract: The $\beta$-ensemble is a prototypical model of a single particle system on a
one-dimensional disordered lattice with inhomogeneous nearest neighbor hopping.
Corresponding nonergodic phase has an anomalous critical energy scale, $E_c$:
correlations are present above and absent below $E_c$ as reflected in the
number variance. We study the dynamical properties of the $\beta$-ensemble
where the critical energy controls the characteristic timescales. In
particular, the spectral form factor equilibrates at a relaxation time,
$t_\mathrm{R} \equiv E_c^{-1}$, which is parametrically smaller than the
Heisenberg time, $t_\mathrm{H}$, given by the inverse of the mean level
spacing. Incidentally, the dimensionless relaxation time, $\tau_\mathrm{R}
\equiv t_\mathrm{R}/t_\mathrm{H} \ll 1$ is equal to the Dyson index, $\beta$.
We show that the energy correlations are absent within a temporal window
$t_\mathrm{R} < t < t_\mathrm{H}$, which we term as the correlation void. This
is in contrast to the mechanism of equilibration in a typical many-body system.
We analytically explain the qualitative behavior of the number variance and the
spectral form factor of the $\beta$-ensemble by a spatially local mapping to
the Anderson model.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS)
problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random
tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are
motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several
equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically
in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was
observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an
efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend
previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case
to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium
phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the
considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape
properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss
the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.

Result: 发现松弛时间tR=Ec^-1远小于海森堡时间tH，且无量纲松弛时间τR=β。能量相关性在tR<t<tH内消失，形成“相关性空洞”。

Conclusion: β-ensemble的动力学行为与非遍历相中的临界能量尺度密切相关，其平衡机制与典型多体系统不同，通过局部映射解释了数方差和谱形式因子的行为。

Abstract: The $\beta$-ensemble is a prototypical model of a single particle system on a
one-dimensional disordered lattice with inhomogeneous nearest neighbor hopping.
Corresponding nonergodic phase has an anomalous critical energy scale, $E_c$:
correlations are present above and absent below $E_c$ as reflected in the
number variance. We study the dynamical properties of the $\beta$-ensemble
where the critical energy controls the characteristic timescales. In
particular, the spectral form factor equilibrates at a relaxation time,
$t_\mathrm{R} \equiv E_c^{-1}$, which is parametrically smaller than the
Heisenberg time, $t_\mathrm{H}$, given by the inverse of the mean level
spacing. Incidentally, the dimensionless relaxation time, $\tau_\mathrm{R}
\equiv t_\mathrm{R}/t_\mathrm{H} \ll 1$ is equal to the Dyson index, $\beta$.
We show that the energy correlations are absent within a temporal window
$t_\mathrm{R} < t < t_\mathrm{H}$, which we term as the correlation void. This
is in contrast to the mechanism of equilibration in a typical many-body system.
We analytically explain the qualitative behavior of the number variance and the
spectral form factor of the $\beta$-ensemble by a spatially local mapping to
the Anderson model.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the Maximum-Average Subtensor ($p$-MAS)
problem, in which one wants to find a subtensor of size $k$ of a given random
tensor of size $N$, both of order $p$, with maximum sum of entries. We are
motivated by recent work on the matrix case of the problem in which several
equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties have been characterized analytically
in the asymptotic regime $1 \ll k \ll N$, and a puzzling phenomenon was
observed involving the coexistence of a clustered equilibrium phase and an
efficient algorithm which produces submatrices in this phase. Here we extend
previous results on equilibrium and algorithmic properties for the matrix case
to the tensor case. We show that the tensor case has a similar equilibrium
phase diagram as the matrix case, and an overall similar phenomenology for the
considered algorithms. Additionally, we consider out-of-equilibrium landscape
properties using Overlap Gap Properties and Franz-Parisi analysis, and discuss
the implications or lack-thereof for average-case algorithmic hardness.

Abstract: Spin-density separation, marked by distinct propagation velocities of spin
and density excitations, epitomizes strong correlations, historically confined
to one-dimensional (1D) systems. Recent ultracold quantum gas experiments,
however, demonstrate its emergence in higher dimensions through precise tuning
of intra- to interspecies interaction ratios, inspiring exploration of how
dimensionality and interatomic interactions govern quantum correlations. We
investigate this in two-component bosonic mixtures with finite-range
interactions, probing 1D and three-dimensional (3D) dynamics. Using effective
field theory within the one-loop approximation, we derive analytical
expressions for zero-temperature ground-state energy and quantum depletion,
seamlessly recovering contact interaction results in the contact limit. By
crafting an effective action for decoupled density and spin modes, we compute
dynamic structure factors (DSFs), revealing how finite-range interactions
sculpt spin-density separation. A pivotal finding is the dimensionality-driven
divergence in DSF peak dynamics: in 1D, peaks ascend to higher frequencies with
increasing interaction strength, yielding sharp responses; in 3D, peaks descend
to lower frequencies, with broader density wave profiles. These insights
highlight dimensionality's critical role in collective excitations and provide
a robust theoretical blueprint for probing interaction-driven quantum phenomena
via Bragg spectroscopy, paving new pathways for exploring dimensionally tuned
quantum correlations in ultracold quantum gases.

Abstract: The Josephson effect can be observed in a Bose-Einstein condensate in a
double-well potential, which is attributed to the tunneling of bosons between
two wells. We propose a multi-mode theory to investigate the dynamics of local
excitations in a one-dimensional condensate in a double-well potential. We show
that the system can be described by two independent two-mode models. The
Josephson oscillation and the self-trapping of local collective excitations are
predicted analytically and confirmed by numerical simulation.

Abstract: The generation of the ground state of a spin vortex in a $^{87}$Rb
Bose-Einstein condensate with the assistance of an optical plug has been
studied. However, gravity is everywhere, and this potential linear dependence
on the spatial position will destroy the axisymmetric structure of the system
with the optical plug. In this case, the question of whether the spin vortex
ground state still exists remains unresolved. The present study aims to explore
the impact of microgravity on the formation of the spin vortex state with the
assistance of an optical plug. To this end, a simple model has been employed to
provide a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. The Gross-Pitaevskii
equations are solved by setting the optical plug intensity, adjusting the
optical plug width, and adjusting the microgravity strength. This process
results in the phase diagram for the single-mode state and spin vortex state.
Under microgravity situations, we observe an off-axis structure of the spin
vortex state. Our calculations offer a reliable approach to generating spin
vortex states in a microgravity environment.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally
coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and
vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, the
cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the
other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this
paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin
transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a
combined symmetry of $\mathcal{T}$ and some other symmetry operation
$\mathcal{O}$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling
transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator
$\mathcal{O}$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our
generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and
experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration
and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that
can be readily verified experimentally.

Conclusion: 半经典框架成功揭示了耗散量子混沌在稳态密度矩阵中的印记，为研究开放量子系统的遍历性、局域化和非平衡相提供了工具。

Abstract: We investigate the quantum-classical correspondence in open quantum many-body
systems using the SU(3) Bose-Hubbard trimer as a minimal model. Combining exact
diagonalization with semiclassical Langevin dynamics, we establish a direct
connection between classical trajectories characterized by fixed-point
attractors, limit cycles, or chaos and the spectral and structural properties
of the quantum steady state. We show that classical dynamical behavior, as
quantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics
of the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with
regular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising
from chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries
constrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and
enforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of
the phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize
phase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation
ratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's
support. We find that the entropy scales as $S \propto \ln N^D$, consistently
capturing the classical nature of the underlying dynamics. This semiclassical
framework, based on stochastic mixtures of coherent states, successfully
reproduces not only observable averages but also finer features such as
spectral correlations and localization properties. Our results demonstrate that
dissipative quantum chaos is imprinted in the steady-state density matrix, much
like in closed systems, and that the interplay between dynamical regimes and
symmetry constraints can be systematically probed using spectral and
phase-space diagnostics. These tools offer a robust foundation for studying
ergodicity, localization, and non-equilibrium phases of open quantum systems.

Result: 展示了该方法能以最小计算成本提取低频振动信息。

Conclusion: 粗粒化与FRESEAN模式分析的结合为未来应用提供了高效工具。

Abstract: At room temperature, low frequency vibrations at far-infrared frequencies are
thermally excited ($k_B T > h \nu$) and not restricted to harmonic fluctuations
around a single potential energy minimum. For folded proteins, these
intrinsically anharmonic vibrations can contain information on slow
conformational transitions. Recently, we have developed FREquency-SElective
ANharmonic (FRESEAN) mode analysis, a method based on time correlation
functions that isolates low-frequency vibrational motions from molecular
dynamics simulation trajectories without relying on harmonic approximations. We
recently showed that low-frequency vibrations obtained from FRESEAN mode
analysis are effective collective variables in enhanced sampling simulations of
conformational ensembles. However, FRESEAN mode analysis is based on velocity
time correlations between all degrees of freedom, which creates computational
challenges for large biomolecules. To facilitate future applications, we
demonstrate here how coarse-graining of all-atom simulation trajectories can be
combined with FRESEAN mode analysis to extract information on low-frequency
vibrations at minimal computational cost.

Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in
which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution
of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional
diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information
needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a
thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with
which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures
that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate
this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If
realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model
that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected
noise or active control of denoising.

Abstract: A new class of one-dimensional, discrete time random walk model with memory,
termed "Random walk with $n$ memory channels" (RW$n$MC) is proposed. In this
model the information of $n$ ($n\in \mathbb{Z}$) previous steps from the

shows that it can lead to asymptotic diffusive and superdiffusive behavior in
different parameter regimes. A connection between RW$n$MC and P\'olya type urn
model evolving by $n$ drawings has also been reported. This connection for the
RW2MC is discussed in detail which suggests the applicability of RW$2$MC in

Abstract: Quantifying space exploration is a central question in random walk theory,
with direct applications ranging from animal foraging, diffusion-limited
reactions, and intracellular transport to stock markets. In particular, the
explored domain by one or many simple memoryless (or Markovian) random walks
has received considerable attention . However, the physical systems mentioned
above typically involve significant memory effects, and so far, no general
framework exists to analyze such systems. We introduce the concept of a
\emph{flip}, defined most naturally in one dimension, where the visited
territory is $[x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}]$: a flip occurs when, after
discovering a new site at $x_{\rm max}$, the walker next discovers $x_{\rm min}
- 1$ instead of $x_{\rm max} + 1$ (and vice-versa).
  While it reduces to the classical splitting probability in Markovian systems,
we show that the flip probability serves as a key observable for quantifying
the impact of memory effects on space exploration.
  Here, we demonstrate that the flip probability follows a strikingly simple
and universal law: it decays inversely with the number of sites visited, as
\(1/n\), independently of the underlying stochastic process. We confirm this
behavior through simulations across paradigmatic non-Markovian models and
observe it in real-world systems, without relying on model assumptions,
including biological tracer motion, DNA sequences, and financial market
dynamics. Finally, we reveal the physical mechanism behind this universality
and show how it extends to higher-dimensional and fractal domains. Our
determination of universal flip statistics lay the groundwork for understanding
how memory effects govern random explorations.

Result: 在周期性势和小分子膜渗透测试中，该方法比伞形采样效率高一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法为自由能估计提供了一种高效且物理原理明确的方案。

Abstract: Accurate free-energy estimation is essential in molecular simulation, yet the
periodic boundary conditions (PBC) commonly used in computer simulations have
rarely been explicitly exploited. Equilibrium methods such as umbrella
sampling, metadynamics, and adaptive biasing force require extensive sampling,
while non-equilibrium pulling with Jarzynski's equality suffers from poor
convergence due to exponential averaging. Here, we introduce a
physics-informed, score-based diffusion framework: by mapping PBC simulations
onto a Brownian particle in a periodic potential, we derive the Fokker-Planck
steady-state score that directly encodes free-energy gradients. A neural
network is trained on non-equilibrium trajectories to learn this score,
providing a principled scheme to efficiently reconstruct the potential of mean
force (PMF). On benchmark periodic potentials and small-molecule membrane
permeation, our method is up to one order of magnitude more efficient than
umbrella sampling.

Conclusion: 研究提供了SBM中宇称破缺的充要条件及其临界值的解析表达，但相图未能完全描述基态特性。

Abstract: By utilizing a unitary transformation, we derive the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the degeneracy between the even- and odd-parity energy states of
the spin-boson model (SBM). Employing the Rayleigh quotient of matrix algebra,
we rigorously prove that the ground state energy of the SBM is lower than the
systems lowest possible degenerate energy and possesses a definite parity.
Based on the necessary and sufficient conditions for parity breaking, we
provide an analytical expression for the parity-breaking critical value, which
is closely related to the expansion order and computational accuracy. This
expression reproduces the SBM phase diagram obtained by quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC) and logarithmic discretization numerical renormalization group (NRG)
methods. However, this phase diagram does not characterize the ground state of
the system.

has been highly controversial in static studies, can be directly deciphered in
the time-domain through their fundamentally distinct order parameter dynamics
measured via time-resolved X-ray scattering at an X-ray free electron laser. In
nonmagnetic ScV6Sn6, the dynamics are characterized by ultrafast melting and
coherent amplitudon oscillations, typical of a phonon-coupled charge order. In
stark contrast, magnetic FeGe exhibits resilient metastable charge order
dynamics, hitherto unobserved in any other charge-ordered system - this unique
time-domain behavior directly signifies an unconventional magnetism-interlocked
charge order state realized in this kagome magnet. Our results not only provide
a model case where unconventional nature of electronic order, hidden in
equilibrium, is directly unraveled in the time-domain, but also pave the way
for future out-of-equilibrium engineering of novel quantum orders in kagome
lattice platforms.

Motivation: 研究HoB₂的磁性行为，探索其独特的铁磁自旋排列和相变现象。

Result: HoB₂在15K和11K处表现出相变，磁矩在50度倾斜方向排列，面内磁各向异性占主导。

Conclusion: HoB₂中存在面内与面外磁各向异性的强烈竞争，导致独特的铁磁自旋排列。

Abstract: Rare-earth (RE) compounds have been of enormous interest in condensed matter
physics as a platform for the exploration of interesting physical phenomena.
Here, we report the successful single crystal growth of HoB$_{2}$, which
exhibits a paramagnetic (PM)-ferromagnetic (FM) phase transition at 15 K and
another phase transition at 11 K, and the discovery of a highly anisotropic
magnetic phase diagram of this FM diboride. Magnetization measurements suggest
that the ferromagnetically ordered moments of Ho$^{3+}$ ions are oriented at a
direction tilted by 50 degrees from the ab-plane at 2K, which rotate largely
toward the ab-plane direction upon application of a magnetic field, but hardly
toward the c-axis direction. Heat capacity and electrical resistivity
measurements clearly demonstrate that the low-temperature phase transition at
11 K occurs even under high magnetic fields along the ab-plane direction,
whereas it disappears immediately by magnetic fields along the c-axis
direction. Moreover, the field-induced crossover phenomenon between FM and PM
phases near 15 K is found to be more promoted when applying a magnetic field
along the ab-plane direction. The resulting magnetic phase diagram reveals that
in-plane magnetic anisotropy is predominant in the present system, which
contradicts the previous report of a spin reorientation phenomenon toward the
c-axis direction between 11 K and 15 K. Taken together, the present findings
suggest the presence of strong competition between in-plane and out-of-plane
magnetic anisotropies in HoB$_{2}$, giving rise to the unique FM spin
arrangement.

Result: 在16K以下观察到c轴铁磁分量与面内自旋共存，并发现一种独特的反铁四极序（AFQ）。

Conclusion: URhSn的基态结构打破了kagome平面的镜面对称性，形成了一种具有手性或极性的AFQ序。

Abstract: Successive phase transitions in the quasi-kagome compound URhSn were
investigated by resonant X-ray scattering (RXS) at the uranium $M_4$ edge. In
the high-temperature phase between 16 K and 54 K, an additional RXS signal was
detected superposed onto fundamental reflections in both $\pi$-$\sigma'$ and
$\pi$-$\pi'$ polarization channels. Upon cooling below 16 K, reported as a
ferromagnetic phase along $c$, substantial enhancements were observed again in
the both polarization channels at the 300 reflection, demonstrating a
simultaneous emergence of in-plane spin alongside the $c$-axis ferromagnetic
components. The observed behavior can be interpreted by an antiferro-quadrupole
(AFQ) order of $O_{yz}$ or $O_{zx}$ characterized by a propagation vector $q =
0$ in the intermediate phase, which then coexists with a ferromagnetic
component below 16 K. The resulting ground state structure breaks the mirror
symmetry perpendicular to the kagome plane, identifying the formation of a
unique AFQ order with either chirality or polarity in URhSn.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了XXZ三角晶格模型中超固态激发的微观起源及其与自旋液体相的关联。

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the
triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale
numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin
dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement
with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound
$\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a
roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory,
accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$
point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral
weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the
observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i)
an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii)
perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a
self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework
is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined
with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the
$M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM
reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near
$\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state
exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse
photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical
analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ
triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed
experimentally.

Conclusion: 研究为磁性拓扑绝缘体中微观无序与宏观现象的关系提供了新见解。

Abstract: We report on the interplay between atomic scale inhomogeneity and competing
magnetic phases and its effect on the anomalous Hall effect in the layered
antiferromagnet MnBi$_4$Te$_7$, a natural superlattice hosting coexisting
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Using a combination of scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM), DC and AC magnetization, and magneto-transport
measurements, we reveal that intrinsic Mn Bi antisite defects induce strong
interlayer exchange coupling, giving rise to a robust exchange bias observed in
both magnetic and Hall responses. The exchange bias undergoes a transition from
asymmetric to symmetric behavior between 2 K and 6 K, indicating a temperature
driven dynamical reconfiguration of interfacial spin structures. The training
effect analysis revealed a stronger contribution of frozen spins at 2 K
compared to 6 K, with relaxation amplitude shift from -264 Oe to 306 Oe. This
sign reversal indicates a field-induced change in interfacial coupling. The
temperature dependence of longitudinal resistivity and magnetization reveals
complementary behavior, indicating the coexistence of two distinct spin states
near the magnetic transition temperature. The phase fraction based resistivity
model captures the distinct scattering mechanisms that govern electronic
transport across different magnetic regimes. Our findings offer a direct link
between microscopic disorder, interfacial magnetism and macroscopic topological
phenomena in magnetic topological insulators.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了晶格几何变化对磁性行为的显著影响，结果可在当前量子气体显微镜中观察到。

Abstract: We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single
dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a
square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice
with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously
varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition
function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of
diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of
Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to
simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a
sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic
ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from
square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.

Abstract: The mysterious quantum-critical Planckian bad metal phase with perfect
T-linear resistivity persisting beyond the quasi-particle limit and universal
T-linear scattering rate has been observed in various high-Tc cuprate
superconductors. Here, we develop a realistic theoretical approach to this
phase in an analytically solvable large-N multi-channel Kondo lattice model,
derived from a heavy-fermion formulated conventionaL t-J model, known for
qualitatively describing cuprates. This phase is originated from critical
charge Kondo fluctuations where disordered local bosonic charge fluctuations
couple to spinon and heavy conduction-electron Fermi surfaces near a
charge-Kondo-breakdown local quantum critical point associated with
pseudogap-to-Fermi liquid transition. Our results show excellent agreement with
experiments and offer broad implications for other unconventional
superconductors.

Abstract: The discovery of local-moment magnetism in van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors
down to the single-layer limit has led to a paradigm shift in the understanding
of two-dimensional (2D) magnets and unleashed their potential for applications
in microelectronic and optoelectronic devices. The incorporation of strong
electronic and magnetic correlations in 2D vdW metals remains a sought-after
platform not only to enable control of emergent quantum phases, such as
superconductivity, but also to achieve more theoretically tractable microscopic
models of complex materials. To date, however, there is limited success in the
discovery of such metallic vdW platforms, and $f$-electron monolayers remain
out of reach. Here we demonstrate that the actinide $\beta$-UTe$_3$ can be
exfoliated to the monolayer limit. A sizable electronic specific heat
coefficient provides the hallmark of strong correlations. Remarkably,
$\beta$-UTe$_3$ remains ferromagnetic in the half-unit-cell limit with an
enhanced ordering temperature of 35 K, a factor of two larger than its bulk
counterpart. Our work establishes $\beta$-UTe$_3$ as a novel materials platform
for investigating and modeling correlated behavior in the monolayer limit and
opens numerous avenues for quantum control with, e.g., strain engineering.
