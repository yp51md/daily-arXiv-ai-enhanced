We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary \"holographic\" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime."}

Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators."}

In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation. This enables us to design a new randomized algorithm to compute the log-partition function through importance sampling augmented by belief propagation. This approach differs from the traditional method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, whose efficiency is hard to guarantee, and enables us to obtain a algorithm with provable polynomial runtime."}

Here, we present extensive numerical evidence that fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) Anderson localization belongs to the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In turn, by adopting the KPZ framework, we gain fresh insight into the structure and phenomenology of Anderson localization itself. We analyze both localized eigenstates and time-evolved wave packets, demonstrating that the fluctuation of their logarithmic density follows the KPZ scaling. Moreover, we reveal that the internal structure of these eigenstates exhibits glassy features characteristic of the directed polymer problem, including the emergence of dominant paths together with pinning and avalanche behavior. Localization is not isotropic but organized along preferential branches of weaker confinement, corresponding to these dominant paths. For localized wave packets, we further demonstrate that their spatial profiles obey a stretched-exponential form consistent with the KPZ scaling, while remaining fully compatible with the single-parameter scaling (SPS) hypothesis, a cornerstone of Anderson localization theory. Altogether, our results establish a unified KPZ framework for describing fluctuations and microscopic organization in 2D Anderson localization, revealing the glassy nature of localized states and providing new understanding into the universal structure of disordered quantum systems."}

Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena."}

Additionally, the relaxation becomes progressively slower with time. The created nonequilibrium state of the glassy system is conveniently described by introducing a fictive temperature which provides the instantaneous state of the nonequilibrium system. The fictive temperature $T_{f} (t)$ is time dependent. During cooling, the fictive temperature is higher than the actual temperature. After the cooling or quenching has ceased, the fictive temperature approaches the final temperature at a rate that depends on the relaxation properties of the liquid. In this work we use linear response theory to connect the time dependence of the fictive temperature to memory function which is shown to be related to the frequency dependent specific heat which itself depends on the fictive temperature $T_{f} (t)$. Thus, one requires { \\it a self-consistent calculation} to capture the interdependence of relaxation rate and structural response function. We present a numerical calculation where we apply our relations to silica where the relaxation function that describes the frequency dependent specific heat and is modeled as a stretched exponential William-Watts (WW) function, while the relaxation time is modeled as a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT). We calculate the fictive temperature self-consistently. $T_{f}(t)$ exhibits the fall out from actual temperature as time (t) progresses."}

Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing."}

By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $ε$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field.

Res. {\\bf 7}, L032049 (2025)], showing that the combined effects of simultaneous contact with thermal baths at different temperatures and external driving forces can split the conventional order-disorder transition into two distinct critical points, determined by which ordered state initially dominates. We show the robustness of this phenomenon by extending a minimal interacting-spin model from the idealized case of simultaneous bath coupling to a finite-time coupling protocol. In particular, we introduce two protocols in which the system interacts with a single bath at a time: a stochastic protocol, where the system randomly switches between the baths at different temperatures, and a deterministic protocol where the coupling alternates periodically. Our analysis reveals two key results: (i) the splitting of phase transitions persists across all coupling schemes -- simultaneous, stochastic, and deterministic -- and (ii) different optimizations of power and efficiency in a collectively operating heat engine reveal that both the stochastic and deterministic protocols exhibit superior global performance at intermediate switching rates and periods when compared to simultaneous coupling. The global trade-off between power and efficiency is described by an expression solely depending on the temperatures of thermal reservoirs as the efficiency approaches to the ideal limit."}

Each task requires many iterations and numerous circuits per iteration, and real-world applications often involve multiple tasks, scaling with the precision needed to explore the application's energy landscape. This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications. Evaluations on scientific and combinatorial benchmarks show shot count reductions of $25.9\\times$ on average and over $100\\times$ for large-scale problems at the same target accuracy.

We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids."}

Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature.

While traditionally derived from specific microscopic mechanisms, the ubiquity of these laws suggests a more general organizing principle. This article proposes a statistical-mechanics framework in which such interaction laws emerge as macroscopic fixed points of aggregation processes involving strongly heterogeneous microscopic contributions.\n  We consider systems where individual interaction sources exhibit heavy-tailed heterogeneity consistent with Zipf-Pareto statistics and where aggregation proceeds without intrinsic length scales. Under minimal assumptions of heterogeneity, multiplicativity, scale invariance, and stability under coarse-graining, we show that the resulting macroscopic interaction field must adopt a scale-free, power-law form. The associated exponent is not imposed a priori but emerges from effective dimensionality, symmetry, and aggregation structure.\n  Within this framework, the inverse-square law is interpreted as a stable statistical fixed point corresponding to isotropic aggregation in an effective three-dimensional space, while deviations from this regime naturally arise from anisotropy, constrained geometries, or nontrivial effective dimensions. This perspective provides a unified interpretation of interaction laws observed in physics, spatial economics, and human geography, without invoking domain-specific microscopic mechanisms.\n  The proposed framework reframes inverse power-law interactions as robust emergent features of Zipfian aggregation rather than as unique consequences of particular physical forces, thereby offering a common statistical explanation for their cross-disciplinary recurrence."}

The mechanism for the log generation has a simple geometric explanation which shows that hole fluctuations are suppressed as the incoming momentum is taken to be along the direction of the defect. The RG flow time is shown to scale with the length of the defect. We also show that the dislon, the Goldstone mode localized to the defect, couples in a non-derivative fashion to the bulk fermions and becomes relevant above the dislons' Debye frequency which depends upon the defect tension."}

A hierarchy of separable neural quantum states is trained on finite-shot local Pauli outcomes and compared against an unconstrained reference model trained on the same data. When all constrained models are statistically disfavored, the data certify entanglement beyond the imposed limit directly from measurement statistics, without reconstructing the density matrix. We validate the method on simulated six- and ten-qubit datasets targeting GHZ, Dicke, and Bell-pair states, and demonstrate robustness for mixed states under local noise.

Here, we present extensive numerical evidence that fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) Anderson localization belongs to the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In turn, by adopting the KPZ framework, we gain fresh insight into the structure and phenomenology of Anderson localization itself. We analyze both localized eigenstates and time-evolved wave packets, demonstrating that the fluctuation of their logarithmic density follows the KPZ scaling. Moreover, we reveal that the internal structure of these eigenstates exhibits glassy features characteristic of the directed polymer problem, including the emergence of dominant paths together with pinning and avalanche behavior. Localization is not isotropic but organized along preferential branches of weaker confinement, corresponding to these dominant paths. For localized wave packets, we further demonstrate that their spatial profiles obey a stretched-exponential form consistent with the KPZ scaling, while remaining fully compatible with the single-parameter scaling (SPS) hypothesis, a cornerstone of Anderson localization theory. Altogether, our results establish a unified KPZ framework for describing fluctuations and microscopic organization in 2D Anderson localization, revealing the glassy nature of localized states and providing new understanding into the universal structure of disordered quantum systems."}

Focusing on the combined effects of single-ion anisotropy, Zeeman field, next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) exchange, and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, we analyze how these parameters influence the magnetization curves and magnon spectra. This work serves two main goals. First, we critically examine the limitations of SRSWT, showing that in the absence of external or interaction tuning, the theory tends to overestimate magnon self-energy corrections, often predicting first-order magnetic transitions with multivalued magnetization and metastable solution branches (i.e., self-consistent but thermodynamically unstable states). Second, we demonstrate that topological transitions -- signaled by magnon gap closings at the Dirac points -- can be tuned to occur below the magnetic transition temperature and within the thermodynamically stable regime. In particular, we identify two practical tuning strategies: applying an external Zeeman field of appropriate sign depending on the anisotropy strength, and introducing a small antiferromagnetic NNN exchange coupling. These findings not only clarify the predictive scope and limitations of SRSWT but also provide experimentally relevant guidance for realizing thermally driven topological transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb magnetic insulators."}

For example, fully symmetry-adapted universal operator pools typically generate long and deep quantum circuits, gate-efficient universal operator pools generally break symmetries, and gate-efficient fully symmetry-adapted operator pools may not be universal. In this work, we analyze such symmetry dilemmas both theoretically and numerically. On the theory side, we prove that the popular, gate-efficient operator pool consisting of singlet spin-adapted singles and perfect-pairing doubles is not universal when spatial symmetry is enforced. To demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of pools, we perform numerical simulations using an adaptive algorithm paired with operator pools that are (i) fully symmetry-adapted and universal, (ii) fully symmetry-adapted and non-universal, and (iii) breaking a single symmetry and are universal. Our numerical simulations encompass three physically relevant scenarios in which the target state is (i) the global ground state, (ii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in multiple symmetry properties, and (iii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in a single symmetry property. Our results show when symmetry-breaking but universal pools can be used safely, when enforcing at least one distinguishing symmetry suffices, and when a particular symmetry must be rigorously preserved to avoid variational collapse. Together, the formal and numerical analysis provides a practical guide for designing and benchmarking symmetry-adapted operator pools that balance universality, resource requirements, and robust state targeting in quantum simulations for chemistry."}

Stepanov"], "title": "Diagrammatics in the Dual Space, or There and Back Again", "comment": "Habilitation thesis", "summary": "Accurately describing many-body effects in multi-orbital systems remains a major challenge in theoretical condensed matter physics. At present, there is a significant methodological gap between the numerical tools used in ab initio computational materials science and those developed to study strong electronic correlations. The former can treat realistic, large-scale systems but typically neglect many-body effects, while the latter focus on simplified models with only a few degrees of freedom, as only such models can be solved accurately in the presence of strong interactions. The purpose of this thesis is to bridge these two approaches and establish a systematic theoretical framework for realistic correlated electronic materials. This involves a full-cycle methodology that begins with constructing ab initio interacting models from density-functional theory, solving them using dynamical mean-field theory to capture local correlations, and extending beyond to incorporate non-local collective electronic fluctuations. To this end, we introduce the \"dual\" approach to strong correlations, which includes the dual fermion, dual boson, and dual triply irreducible local expansion methods. The central idea of the dual theories is to shift the reference point of the conventional Feynman diagrammatic expansion from a non-interacting electronic system to an interacting but exactly solvable one. Integrating out this reference system recasts the expansion in an effective dual space, where all diagrammatic building blocks are renormalized by the corresponding impurity quantities. This procedure transforms a non-perturbative expansion in the original variables into a perturbative expansion in terms of dual fermionic and bosonic fields, exact in both the weak- and strong-coupling limits. In this thesis, we collect and systematize the major developments of dual techniques achieved to date."}

I argue that the deeper conflict is logical: quantum theory is inherently contextual, whereas the classical tradition presupposes a single global, Boolean valuation. Building on Bohr's complementarity, the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen argument and Bell's theorem, I recast locality and completeness as the existence of a global section of a presheaf of value assignments over the category of measurement contexts. The absence of global sections expresses the impossibility of context-independent description, and Čech cohomology measures the resulting obstruction. The internal logic of the presheaf topos is intuitionistic, and the seven-valued contextual logic proposed by Ghose and Patra is exhibited as a finite Heyting algebra capturing patterns of truth, falsity and indeterminacy across incompatible contexts. Classical physics corresponds to the sheaf case, where compatible local data glue and Boolean logic is effectively restored. Measurement is therefore reinterpreted as sheafification of presheaf-valued truth rather than as a physical breakdown of unitarity. Finally, a $σ$--$λ$ dynamics motivated by stochastic mechanics provides a continuous interpolation between strongly contextual and approximately classical regimes, dissolving the usual measurement paradoxes and apparent nonlocality as artefacts of an illegitimate demand for global truth."}

These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\\pm π/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-γ}$ with $2<γ< 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid.

The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature.

In practice, however, birefringence-induced transverse walk-off breaks this factorization and couples these degrees of freedom.

In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected.

Here, we present extensive numerical evidence that fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) Anderson localization belongs to the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In turn, by adopting the KPZ framework, we gain fresh insight into the structure and phenomenology of Anderson localization itself. We analyze both localized eigenstates and time-evolved wave packets, demonstrating that the fluctuation of their logarithmic density follows the KPZ scaling. Moreover, we reveal that the internal structure of these eigenstates exhibits glassy features characteristic of the directed polymer problem, including the emergence of dominant paths together with pinning and avalanche behavior. Localization is not isotropic but organized along preferential branches of weaker confinement, corresponding to these dominant paths. For localized wave packets, we further demonstrate that their spatial profiles obey a stretched-exponential form consistent with the KPZ scaling, while remaining fully compatible with the single-parameter scaling (SPS) hypothesis, a cornerstone of Anderson localization theory. Altogether, our results establish a unified KPZ framework for describing fluctuations and microscopic organization in 2D Anderson localization, revealing the glassy nature of localized states and providing new understanding into the universal structure of disordered quantum systems."}

The method addresses limitations of many algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) etc by using shallow Trotterized circuits for short real-time evolution on a quantum processor. The sampled basis is then symmetry-filtered by using various symmetries of the Hamiltonian which is then classically diagonalized in the reduced Hilbert space. We benchmark this approach on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain up to 24 qubits using the IBM Heron processor. The algorithm achieves sub-percent accuracy in ground-state energies across various anisotropy regimes. Crucially, it outperforms the Sampling Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method, demonstrating a substantially lower energy error for comparable reduced-space dimensions. This work validates symmetry-filtered, real-time sampling as a robust and efficient path for studying correlated quantum systems on current near-term hardware."}

However, any QCNN operating on classical data must rely on an encoding scheme to embed inputs into quantum states, and this choice can dominate both performance and resource requirements. This work presents an implementation-level comparison of three representative encodings -- Angle, Amplitude, and a Hybrid phase/angle scheme -- for QCNNs under depolarizing noise. We develop a fully differentiable PyTorch--Qiskit pipeline with a custom autograd bridge, batched parameter-shift gradients, and shot scheduling, and use it to train QCNNs on downsampled binary variants of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST at $4\\times 4$ and $8\\times 8$ resolutions.\n  Our experiments reveal regime-dependent trade-offs. On aggressively downsampled $4\\times 4$ inputs, Angle encoding attains higher accuracy and remains comparatively robust as noise increases, while the Hybrid encoder trails and exhibits non-monotonic trends. At $8\\times 8$, the Hybrid scheme can overtake Angle under moderate noise, suggesting that mixed phase/angle encoders benefit from additional feature bandwidth. Amplitude-encoded QCNNs are sparsely represented in the downsampled grids but achieve strong performance in lightweight and full-resolution configurations, where training dynamics closely resemble classical convergence. Taken together, these results provide practical guidance for choosing QCNN encoders under joint constraints of resolution, noise strength, and simulation budget."}

The polarization is found not only in the amplitudes but also in the periods of the Weiss oscillations. It is found that the period polarization in Weiss oscillations originates from the polarized effective Fermi energies or the polarized Landau level spacing scales. In Weiss oscillations, polarization in amplitude does not imply the presence of polarization in period, whereas polarization in period is accompanied by polarization in amplitude. The superposition of polarization in amplitude and polarization in period enables the appearance of considerable polarization in Weiss oscillations under relatively weak external electric fields."}

With a constellation of satellites and a set of ground stations in a satellite-based QKD system, how to schedule satellites to achieve efficient QKD is an important problem. This problem has been studied in the dual-downlink architecture, where each satellite distributes pairs of entanglements to two ground stations simultaneously. However, it has not been studied in the single downlink architecture, where satellites create keys with each individual ground station, and then serve as trusted nodes to create keys between pairs of ground stations. While the single downlink architecture provides weaker security in that the satellites need to be trusted, it has many advantages, including the potential of achieving significantly higher key rates, and generating keys between pairs of ground stations that are far away from each other and cannot be served using the dual-downlink architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic approach for satellite scheduling that accounts for fairness among the ground station pairs, while taking advantage of the dynamic satellite channels to maximize the system performance. We evaluate this approach in a wide range of settings and demonstrate that it provides the best tradeoffs in terms of total and minimum key rates across the ground station pairs. Our evaluation also highlights the importance of considering seasonal effects and cloud coverage in evaluating satellite-based QKD systems. In addition, we show different tradeoffs in global and regional QKD systems."}

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations."}

Here we show that conformally coated Ni Nanotubes arranged in a woodpile geometry with lattice spacings ranging from 800 to 1200 nm, realised by two-photon lithography and atomic layer deposition, exhibit a geometry-tuneable balance between chiral and axial states. Magnetic force microscopy on the top layer of the 3D woodpile reveals that few-layer systems exhibit a chiral contrast whilst increasing the number of stacked layers drives a transition to an axial configuration with the change in state populations depending strongly on lattice spacing. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that chirality is not intrinsic to isolated tubes but is imprinted by spin textures formed in the substrate sheet film, which couple into the 3D network. As the sheet-film influence diminishes with increasing layer number, dipolar interactions dominate and stabilise the axial state. This two-stage mechanism of chirality imprinting followed by increasingly dominant dipolar interactions, provides clear control parameters for tailoring spin-texture populations.

The effective CD-phase Hamiltonian takes into account local ($U$) and nonlocal ($V$) correlations, and the transfer of composite bosons ($t_b$). Within the framework of the effective field approximation, we have shown the existence of two types of CD phases: the high-temperature classical paramagnetic CO-phase of charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and the low-temperature magnetic quantum CDq phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, with ''uncertain valence'' [NiO$_{6}$]$^{(9\\pmδ)-}$ ($0 \\le δ\\le 1$) and spin density $(1 \\pm δ)/2$ NiO$_6$-centers.

While frame-change maps and frame-invariant resource sums are theoretically understood, their impact on circuit-based quantum information processing has largely remained unexplored. We formulate QRF transformations as circuit compilation rules and, for systems with finite Abelian symmetry described by the regular representation, derive a gate-level dictionary that maps local operations in one frame to their images in another. This yields a group-theoretic classification of gates where symmetry-commuting operators remain local, up to frame-dependent phases, while generic gates are promoted to controlled entangling operations in which the original frame acts as a control register. The resulting frame-dependence entangling-gate count defines a relational circuit complexity where the cost of a computation depends on the internal reference frame of the observer. We instantiate the framework in a three-qubit model and show that the QRF unitary acts as a lossless converter between a purity-based local coherence and concurrence, preserving their invariant sum and giving a concrete realization of the relativity of entanglement. We implement the corresponding circuits on an IBM Quantum superconducting platform, using full state tomography to reconstruct the redistribution of resources between internal frames. The hardware data reproduce the predicted conversion of local coherence into entanglement, and the observed deviations from exact conservation quantify the effect of realistic device noise on relational quantum protocols."}

Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin.

We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary \"holographic\" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics.

In this paper, we present Quantum Neural Radiance Fields (Q-NeRF), the first hybrid quantum-classical framework for neural radiance field rendering. Q-NeRF integrates QIREN modules into the Nerfacto backbone, preserving its efficient sampling, pose refinement, and volumetric rendering strategies while replacing selected density and radiance prediction components with quantum-enhanced counterparts. We systematically evaluate three hybrid configurations on standard multi-view indoor datasets, comparing them to classical baselines using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics.

Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime."}

Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators."}

A wide range of classical machine learning methods, as well as more recent quantum machine learning approaches, have been investigated to address this challenge, each providing valuable progress but also leaving open questions regarding scalability, robustness, and adaptability to evolving fraud patterns. In this work, we introduce the Fidelity-based Quantum Autoencoder (FiD-QAE), a quantum architecture that employs fidelity estimation as the decision criterion for anomaly detection. Transactions are encoded into quantum states, compressed through a variational quantum circuit, and evaluated using the SWAP test to distinguish legitimate from fraudulent transactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FiD-QAE, including statistical analyses, multiple performance metrics, and robustness tests under quantum noise models. The results show that FiD-QAE maintains consistent performance across different imbalance levels and preserves robustness in noisy conditions. Moreover, validation on IBM Quantum hardware backends confirms the feasibility of our approach on real devices, with outcomes consistent with simulation. These findings position quantum fidelity as a powerful criterion for anomaly detection and highlight FiD-QAE as a promising direction that complements existing classical and quantum approaches, offering robustness and generalizability for financial fraud detection in realistic environments."}

In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \\textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $ν=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \\textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $ν=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL.

Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice. We then introduce an imaginary-time-enhanced FALQON (ITE-FALQON) scheme, which inserts short imaginary-time evolution steps into the feedback loop. The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems."}

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

Thus, the environment becomes the Hilbert space, where the natural definition of the cvQFT will be related to rotation operators, which in the $N$--mode are completely specified by unitary matrices of order $N$. Then the cvQFT is defined as the rotation operator whose rotation matrix is given by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. For the implementation of rotation operators with primitive components (single--mode rotations and beam splitters), we follow the well known Murnaghan procedure, with appropriate modifications. Moreover, algorithms related to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are applied to reduce drastically the implementation complexity. The final part is concerned with the application of the cvQFT to general Gaussian states.

However, the evolution of quantum coherence for light beams undergoing fundamental optical processes at dielectric interfaces remains unexplored. Furthermore, manipulating multiphoton correlations typically requires complex interactions that challenge few-photon level implementation. Here, we introduce a quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem for light beams, describing how their coherence-polarization properties are influenced by reflection and refraction, as well as how these properties evolve upon subsequent propagation. Our work demonstrates that the quantum statistics of photonic systems can be controllably modified through the inherent polarization coupling arising from reflection and refraction at an interface, without relying on conventional light-matter interactions. Our approach reveals regimes where thermal light can exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics with fluctuations below the shot-noise level through post-selected measurements, and this statistical property can be tuned by the incident angle. Remarkably, this quantum statistical modification is governed by a scaling law linking beam collimation to far-field thermalization. Our work establishes a robust, decoherence-avoiding mechanism for quantum state control, advancing the fundamental understanding of coherence in quantum optics and opening new avenues for applications in quantum information and metrology."}

Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice. We then introduce an imaginary-time-enhanced FALQON (ITE-FALQON) scheme, which inserts short imaginary-time evolution steps into the feedback loop. The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems."}

They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales."}

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

Although a quantum-assisted hierarchical fuzzy neural network (QA-HFNN) was proposed to learn fuzzy membership for each feature, it cannot model dependencies between features due to its single-qubit encoding. To address this, this paper proposes a dual-qubit hierarchical fuzzy neural network (DQ-HFNN), encoding feature pairs onto a pair of entangled qubits, which extends the single-feature fuzzy model to a joint fuzzy representation. By introducing quantum entanglement, the dual-qubit circuit can encode non-classical correlations, enabling the model to directly learn relationship patterns between feature pairs. Experiments on benchmarks show that DQ-HFNN demonstrates higher classification accuracy than QA-HFNN, as well as classical deep learning baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies after controlling for circuit depth and parameter counts show that the performance gain mainly stems from the relational modeling capability enabled by entanglement rather than enhanced expressivity. The proposed DQ-HFNN model exhibits high parameter efficiency and fast inference speed. Experiments under noisy conditions suggest that it is robust against noise and has the potential to be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices."}

The relationship between available entanglement and the sharing capacity remains largely unexplored, which constrains the efficient design and scalability of quantum networks. Here, we establish the entanglement threshold required to support unbounded sharing across an entire network by introducing a protocol based on probabilistic projective measurements.

Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine.

However, in the context of controlling ``chaotic'' quantum unitary dynamics, the situation is far more tenuous. The classical concepts of exponential sensitivity to trajectory initial conditions and ergodicity do not directly translate into quantum unitary evolution. Nevertheless properties inherent to quantum chaos can take on those roles: i) the dynamical sensitivity to weak perturbations, measured by the fidelity decay, serves a similar purpose as the classical sensitivity to initial conditions; and ii) paired with the fact that quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to be statistically described by random matrix theory, implies a method to translate the ergodic feature into the control of quantum dynamics. With those two properties, it can be argued that quantum chaotic dynamical systems, in principle, allow for full controllability beyond a characteristic time that scales only logarithmically with system size and $\\hbar^{-1}$. In the spirit of classical targeting, it implies that it is possible to fine tune the immense quantum interference with weak perturbations and steer the system from any initial state into any desired target state, subject to constraints imposed by conserved quantities. In contrast, integrable dynamics possess neither ergodicity nor exponential instability, and thus the weak perturbations apparently must break the integrability for control purposes. The main ideas are illustrated with the quantum kicked rotor. The production of revivals, cat-like entangled states, and the transition from any random state to any other random state is possible as demonstrated."}

We show that the number of steps of the corresponding Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) algorithm that prepares a ground state to a given precision depends on the structure of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we develop an upper bound for the number of RGD steps that depends on the spectral gap of the Hamiltonian, the overlap between ground and initial state, and the target precision. In numerical experiments we study examples where we observe for a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions that the RGD steps needed to prepare a ground state scales linearly with the number of spins. For all-to-all couplings a quadratic scaling is obtained. To achieve efficient implementations while keeping convergence guarantees, we develop RGD approximations by randomly projecting the Riemannian gradient into polynomial-sized subspaces. We find that the speed of convergence of the randomly projected RGD critically depends on the size of the subspace the gradient is projected into. Finally, we develop efficient quantum device implementations based on Trotterization and a quantum stochastic drift-inspired protocol. We implement the resulting quantum algorithms on IBM's quantum devices and provide data for small-scale problems."}

Including boundaries of 3D color codes, we demonstrate that the 3D restriction decoder achieves optimal scaling of the logical error rate and a threshold value of 1.55(6)% for code-capacity bit- and phase-flip noise, which is almost a factor of two higher than previously reported for this family of codes [2, 3].

Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics. Our findings also provide important insights for the development of quantum technologies that use entanglement in the time domain, including non-local temporal interferometry, temporal ghost imaging, and temporal state tomography in multi-particle systems."}

It generalizes its classical counterpart by extending the concept beyond temperature equilibration. This paper approaches the QME in Markovian open quantum systems from different perspectives. First, we propose a physical mechanism based on decoherence-free subspaces. Second, we show that an exponential enhancement of the decay rate toward equilibrium, scaling with system size, can be obtained, leading to an extreme version of the phenomenon in Markovian open quantum systems. Third, we study the strong Mpemba effect through the unravelings of Davies maps, revealing subtleties in the choice of figures of merit used to identify the QME.

For that purpose, dequantization algorithms play a central role in providing a clear theoretical framework to separate the complexity of quantum and classical algorithms. However, existing dequantized algorithms typically rely on sampling procedures, leading to prohibitively large computational overheads and hindering their practical implementation on classical computers. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based dequantization framework for GSEE that eliminates the sampling process while preserving the asymptotic complexity of prior dequantized algorithms. In our formulation, the overhead arising from sampling is replaced by the growth of the bond dimension required to represent Chebyshev vectors as tensor network states. Consequently, physical structure, such as entanglement and locality, is naturally reflected in the computational cost. By combining this approach with tensor network approximations, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), we construct a practical dequantization algorithm that is executable within realistic computational resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can efficiently construct high-degree polynomials up to $d=10^4$ for Hamiltonians with up to $100$ qubits, explicitly revealing the crossover between classically tractable and quantum advantaged regimes. These results indicate that tensor network-based dequantization provides a crucial tool toward the rigorous, quantitative verification of quantum advantage in realistic many-body systems."}

We consider a bosonic model with two phase-shift parameters and analyze the performance of second- and third-order nonlinear scrambling using two classes of probe states: squeezed vacuum states and coherent states. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear scrambling mitigates sloppiness, increases compatibility, and improves overall estimation precision. We find third-order nonlinearity to be more effective than second-order under both fixed-probe and fixed-energy constraints. Furthermore, by comparing joint estimation to a stepwise estimation strategy, we show that a threshold for nonlinear coupling exists. For coherent probes, joint estimation outperforms the stepwise strategy if the nonlinearity is sufficiently large, while for squeezed probes, this advantage is observed specifically with third-order nonlinearity."}

We point out that the relevant mechanism is not intrinsically field-theoretic, but is essentially a quantum tunneling/evanescent matter channel, which is already captured within ordinary quantum mechanics. More importantly, the microscopic constituents of realistic macroscopic objects are bound and localized by strong potentials, introducing a large internal energy scale that suppresses coherent propagation between distant bodies. Including such binding/localization generically yields an exponential suppression, rendering the matter-mediated contribution negligible at the macroscopic separations relevant to gravitational-entanglement proposals.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles."}

In turn, by adopting the KPZ framework, we gain fresh insight into the structure and phenomenology of Anderson localization itself. We analyze both localized eigenstates and time-evolved wave packets, demonstrating that the fluctuation of their logarithmic density follows the KPZ scaling. Moreover, we reveal that the internal structure of these eigenstates exhibits glassy features characteristic of the directed polymer problem, including the emergence of dominant paths together with pinning and avalanche behavior. Localization is not isotropic but organized along preferential branches of weaker confinement, corresponding to these dominant paths. For localized wave packets, we further demonstrate that their spatial profiles obey a stretched-exponential form consistent with the KPZ scaling, while remaining fully compatible with the single-parameter scaling (SPS) hypothesis, a cornerstone of Anderson localization theory.

These findings provide a key experimental benchmark for the quantum-classical crossover and suggest that lattice topology can play a crucial role in tuning the balance between quantum and classical physics in strongly correlated systems."}

Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena."}

Here, we demonstrate that local connected correlation functions provide a superior, practical means to directly probe the dynamics of magnetic order in a quenched Rydberg atom array. Using a Magnus expansion formalism, we derive analytic expressions for these correlations that capture a smooth crossover from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic dominance. Our analytic results, which reveal the critical parameter relationship $U_{c}(δ)$, are validated against exact numerical simulations and exhibit robustness to finite-size effects. By shifting the focus from global singularities to local correlations, our protocol establishes a direct and feasible path to observe the rich critical dynamics in scalable quantum simulators."}

However, their current performance is mostly limited by large dot-to-dot variability that leads to uncontrolled qubit energies and random tilts in the spin quantization axis. Here, we propose a systematic and local method to engineer the spin qubit response by imprinting a controlled anisotropy in the quantum dot confinement, enabling on-demand electric g-tensor control. In particular, we find that both the quantum-dot size and asymmetry allow electrical tuning of the g-tensor and significantly suppress magnitude and angular variability of the spin response for selected magnetic field directions. We confirm this behavior by analyzing single-disorder realizations and statistical ensembles in state-of-the-art strained and unstrained germanium channels, showing that the latter provides an optimal path for $g$-tensor engineering. Our results provide practical design principles for on-demand control of the spin response and mitigating variability, paving the way towards large-scale germanium-based quantum computers."}

It is assumed that the leads act as inert reservoirs that simply supply/absorb electrons to/from the sample. Within a model of a CI coupled to leads with a cylindrical geometry, we show that this is not true. In the proximity of the CI, the edge current leaks into the leads, with the Hall conductance quantized only if this novel proximity effect is taken into account. For a special choice of leads, we identify the conductance with a topological invariant of the system, in terms of the winding number of the phase of the reflection coefficients of the scattering states."}

The method addresses limitations of many algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) etc by using shallow Trotterized circuits for short real-time evolution on a quantum processor. The sampled basis is then symmetry-filtered by using various symmetries of the Hamiltonian which is then classically diagonalized in the reduced Hilbert space. We benchmark this approach on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain up to 24 qubits using the IBM Heron processor. The algorithm achieves sub-percent accuracy in ground-state energies across various anisotropy regimes. Crucially, it outperforms the Sampling Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method, demonstrating a substantially lower energy error for comparable reduced-space dimensions. This work validates symmetry-filtered, real-time sampling as a robust and efficient path for studying correlated quantum systems on current near-term hardware."}

In this work, we develop a unified framework that clarifies the origin of ETH by separating kinematic typicality from dynamical input. We show that the characteristic ETH structure of local operator matrix elements follows from four ingredients: the maximum entropy principle, the geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space, the locality of physical observables, and a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP). ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable from typical states within a narrow microcanonical shell with respect to local measurements. Within this framework, diagonal ETH emerges from measure concentration, while the universal exponential suppression and smooth energy-frequency dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements arise from entropic scaling and local dynamical correlations, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, geometry, and chaos-induced typicality, and clarify its scope, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics."}

Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}\\times{\\bf B})\\cdotσ$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $ΔR_{zz}(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E},{\\bf B})/R_0=-β_{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\cal E}\\times{\\bf B})^2$, with $β_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric. Our findings establish a new, quantum geometric and non-Markovian memory effect in magnetotransport, paving the way for controlling electronic transport in complex and topological matter."}
