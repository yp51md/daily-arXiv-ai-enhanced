The QD dynamics are investigated in the framework of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which includes long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) and the beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, revealing the emergence of self-bound states. Stable stationary solutions for multipole QDs with different values of the topological charge (vorticity $S$) are shaped as necklace-like modes, with the number of \\textquotedblleft beads\" (multipole's order) $n=2S$, up to $S=6$. The stability area of the multipoles shrinks with the increase of $S$. For higher values of $S$ the centrifugal effect associated with the phase winding destabilizes the annular density and drives the formation of fragmented multipole droplet states. The dependence of the chemical potential, total energy and peak density on the norm (number of particles) and $S$ is produced. These findings uncover the stabilizing effect of the LHY correction and DDI anisotropy in maintaining complex QD states in the non-rotating configurations."}

We demonstrate that scrambling safeguards precision by dispersing information about the encoded parameter into many-body correlations. For Haar-random scrambling unitaries, we derive exact formulas for the average quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the reduced state after tracing out lost particles. The result exhibits a threshold; any remaining subsystem larger than $N/2$ recovers the full QFI, while smaller subsystems contain negligible information. We link this threshold to the scrambling-induced transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement and the associated growth of the Schmidt rank. We outline two realizations -- a brickwork circuit and chaotic XX-chain evolution -- and demonstrate the protection of one-axis-twisted probes against the loss of up to half of the particles."}

While integrability is known to survive in static and periodically driven systems, its fate in the complete absence of time-translation symmetry, particularly in interacting random quantum circuits, has remained unclear. Here we construct integrable random quantum circuits built from inhomogeneous XXZ R-matrices. Remarkably, integrability is preserved for arbitrary sequences of gate layers, ranging from quasiperiodic to fully random, thereby explicitly breaking both continuous and discrete time-translation symmetry. Using large-scale time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group simulations at infinite temperature and half filling, we map out the resulting spin-transport phase diagram and identify ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes controlled by the spectral parameters of the R-matrices. The spatiotemporal structure of spin correlations within each regime depends sensitively on the inhomogeneity, exhibiting spatial asymmetry and sharp peak structures tied to near-degenerate quasiparticle velocities. To account for these findings, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics framework adapted to time-dependent integrable circuits, yielding Euler-scale predictions for correlation functions, Drude weights, and diffusion bounds. This approach identifies the quasiparticles governing transport and quantitatively captures both the scaling exponents and fine structures of the correlation profiles observed numerically. Our results demonstrate that exact Yang-Baxter integrability is compatible with stochastic quantum dynamics and establish generalized hydrodynamics as a predictive framework for transport in time-dependent integrable systems."}

Applying this technique to transition metal dichalcogenide moiré semicondutors, we predict itinerant ferromagnetism in WSe$_2$/WS$_2$ and an antiferromagnetic insulator in twisted $Γ$-valley homobilayer, using the same neural network without any physics input beyond the microscopic Hamiltonian. Crucially, both types of magnetic states are obtained from a single calculation within the $S_z=0$ sector, removing the need to compute and compare multiple $S_z$ sectors. This significantly reduces computational cost and paves the way for faster and more reliable magnetic material design."}

There is good agreement between the results of measurements of the generated internal magnetic field obtained using a ferroprobe and recording the EMF induced by the occurrence of generation currents in an external magnetic field, which determines the conditions of the mechanism of the nondissipative transport in the edge channels at room temperature, which is caused by their interactions with single carriers through negative U dipole boron centers.

This study explores the practical application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) combined with Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) to address a multi-objective territorial planning problem. We model an 88-variable portfolio optimization involving carbon sequestration, biodiversity connectivity, and social impact metrics, executed on intermediate-scale IBM Quantum hardware (ibm_torino and ibm_fez). The results of seven independent hardware runs demonstrate that the QAOA+ZNE workflow consistently outperforms a classical greedy baseline. The quantum method achieves a mean portfolio score of 58.47 +/- 6.98, corresponding to a 31.6% improvement over the classical heuristic (44.42), with high statistical significance (p = 0.0009) and a large effect size (Cohen's d = 2.01), where ZNE yields extrapolated expectation values of the portfolio objective rather than a discrete portfolio solution without noise. A validation run conducted after a 13-day interval confirms the temporal stability of the methodology against hardware calibration drifts. These findings establish empirical quantum utility in an environmental science context, showing that current NISQ-era devices, when coupled with rigorous error mitigation, can identify complex territorial synergies that myopic classical approaches overlook. The proposed workflow provides a scalable methodological template for high-precision environmental conservation policies."}

While these phenomena are well-described by continuum hydrodynamics, a microscopic framework connecting them to their topological origins has remained elusive. Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p<1$). This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators. Our results provide a discrete microscopic description for odd diffusion, offering a powerful toolkit to predict transport in confined geometries and disordered chiral media."}

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms."}

Here, we analytically and computationally demonstrate how the optimal tuning of a recurrent neural network is determined given a finite integration time. Rather than maximizing the theoretically available sensitivity, we find networks attain different sensitivities depending on the available time. Consequently, the optimal dynamic regime can shift away from criticality when integration times are finite, highlighting the necessity of incorporating finite-time considerations into studies of information processing."}

While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question. Here we demonstrate systematic noise mitigation during spin shuttling in a linear $^{28}$Si/SiGe quantum dot device. First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\\,μ\\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\\,μ\\text{s}$. Finally, we incorporate dynamical decoupling techniques while periodically shuttling over distances exceeding $200\\,\\text{nm}$, reaching $T_\\text{2}^{H,sh}= 32\\,μ\\text{s}$. For the same setup, we demonstrate that dressed-state shuttling provides robust protection against low-frequency noise with a decay time $T_R^{\\text{sh}} = 21\\,μ\\text{s}$, without the overhead of pulsed control and allowing protection during one-way spin transport. By preserving coherence over timescales exceeding typical gate and readout operations, the demonstrated strategies establish mobile spin qubits as a viable solution for scalable silicon quantum processors."}

Starting from a topological generalization of generalized probabilistic theories, we consider probability assignments defined as functions of an operational transition probability between pure states. We show that under three operationally motivated requirements: no superluminal signaling, availability of normal steering via purification in a sigma additive sense, and sigma affinity of probabilities under countable preparation mixtures, any admissible rule within this class must reduce to the identity. In particular, nonlinear deviations generically enable operational signaling distinctions in steering scenarios, while continuity combined with sigma affinity excludes non affine alternatives. This identifies a unique causal fixed point. Within this class of probability rules, the Born rule emerges as the only assignment compatible with no signaling in operational theories admitting normal steering. We connect the operational result to standard infinite-dimensional quantum mechanics through the normal state space of von Neumann algebras and the GNS representation, recovering the conventional Born rule for projective and generalized measurements. We discuss the scope of the assumptions and implications for proposed post quantum modifications in continuous variable and quantum field theoretic regimes."}

In this work, we study the impact of dissipation on the nodal ring in a 3D topological semimetal. We find that the energy spectrum becomes fully complex in the presence of dissipation, and the original nodal ring is split into two exceptional rings. We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings. We also propose a 1D model that has the same topological feature in the parameter space. It provides a simple way to measure the topological invariant in a low-dimensional system.

Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers a generic quadratic reduction in sample complexity 1/sqrt(p) vs 1/p, but applying it to steady-state queueing networks in challenging: classical simulations involve unbounded state spaces and random regeneration cycles, whereas quantum circuits have fixed depth and finite registers.\n  In this paper, we develop a framework for quantum simulation of delay tail probabilities based on truncated regenerative simulation. We show that regenerative rare-event estimators can be reformulated as deterministic, reversible functions of finite random seeds by truncating regeneration cycles. To control the resulting bias, we use Lyapunov drift and concentration arguments to derive exponential tail bounds on regeneration times. This allows the truncation horizon--and hence the quantum circuit depth--to be chosen such that the bias is provably negligible compared to the statistical error. The proposed framework enables quantum estimation in models with countably infinite state spaces, avoiding the challenge of determining the sufficient mixing time required for direct finite-horizon simulation. We provide bounds on qubit and circuit complexity for a GI-GI-1 queue, a wireless network under MaxWeight scheduling, and a multi-server system with Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) routing."}

The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced."}

These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise."}

This formulation identifies the appropriate thermodynamic entropy in nonequilibrium quantum processes as the energy entropy associated with energy measurements, demonstrating that the von Neumann entropy does not, in general, represent thermodynamic entropy away from equilibrium. Within this framework, dynamical temperature, free energy, work, and heat are consistently defined, and both the first and second laws are shown to hold far from equilibrium.

The key mechanism is the introduction of moiré potentials for the band-edge carriers induced by the lateral modulation of interlayer interactions. This trapping potential results in the formation of flat bands, which enhances the strong correlation effect. However, a full understanding of the origin of this intriguing potential remains elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the origin of moiré potentials in both R-type and H-type moiré patterns formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. We show that both lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer contribute significantly to the formation of moiré potentials. In particular, the lattice reconstruction induces a nonuniform local strain, which creates an energy modulation of 200 meV for the conduction band-edge state located at WS$_2$ layer and 20 meV for the valence band-edge state located at WSe$_2$ layer. In addition, the lattice reconstruction also introduces a piezopotential energy, whose amplitude ranges from 40 meV to 90 meV depending on the stacking and band-edge carrier. The interlayer charge transfer induces a built-in electric field, resulting in an energy modulation of 80 meV for an R-type moiré and 40 meV for an H-type moiré. Taking into account both effects from lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer, the formation of moiré potential is well understood for both R-type and H-type moirés. This trapping potential localizes the wavefunctions of conduction and valence bands around the same moiré site for an R-type moiré, while around different moiré site for an H-type one."}

The result exhibits a threshold; any remaining subsystem larger than $N/2$ recovers the full QFI, while smaller subsystems contain negligible information. We link this threshold to the scrambling-induced transition from area-law to volume-law entanglement and the associated growth of the Schmidt rank.

In this paper, we present a universal formulation of the elementary foundations of thermodynamics, in which entropy and energy are defined and employed beyond equilibrium and without assuming extensivity. The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes. The resulting framework presents thermodynamics as a universal theory whose concepts apply uniformly to all systems, large and small, and provides a coherent foundation for both teaching and modern applications."}

Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$.

We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed."}

Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in α-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes α Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems."}

First, we compute corrections to the strong coupling (i.e., double-exchange) spin wave dispersion of itinerant ferromagnets. We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction. We show that in the case of the Kane-Mele honeycomb lattice Kondo ferromagnet this leads to topological magnon bands, and discuss the implications of this result for itinerant ferromagnets more broadly."}

Our simulations reveal the emission of hundreds of harmonics under realistic conditions, with amplitudes far exceeding those obtained in light-driven schemes.

The traditional approach uses N-shaped and Z-shaped schedules, selecting the orientation in each plaquette to avoid hook errors aligned with logical operators. However, this becomes increasingly complex within lattice surgery primitives with varied boundary geometries, and requires a 7-step schedule to avoid gate collisions. We propose the diagonal schedule, which orients hook errors along the diagonal of each plaquette. These diagonal errors crucially never align with logical operators regardless of boundary orientation, achieving full code distance. The diagonal schedule is globally uniform: all X-type plaquettes use one schedule and all Z-type plaquettes use another, eliminating geometry-dependent planning. On hardware supporting parallel measurement, reset, and gate operations, the schedule achieves a minimal period of 6 time steps, compared to 7 for the traditional approach. We demonstrate effectiveness for memory experiments, spatial junctions, spatial Hadamard gates, and patch rotation, showing equivalent or improved logical error rates while simplifying circuit construction."}

Theoretically, half of the observed value can be attributed to the exchange enhancement of SOS in a finite-density electron gas, but explaining the rest requires refining the DFT approach. As the conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$ is set by a delicate balance between the contribution of sulphur $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals and $d_{z^2}-d_{xz}$ and $d_{z^2}-d_{yz}$ mixing in molybdenum, we use a DFT+U+V framework for fine-tuning the orbital composition of the relevant band-edge states. An optimised choice of Hubbard U/V parameters produces close agreement with the experimentally observed conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$, simultaneously resulting in the valence-band SOS and the quasi-particle band gap which are closer to their values established in the earlier-published experiments."}

However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) -- a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory.

Direct estimation via the Hadamard test requires controlled implementations of $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\mathrm{i}Ht}$, and the depth of these controlled circuits grows with $t$, making long-time estimation challenging on near-term hardware. We introduce Quantum Phaselift, a lifting-based framework that estimates the rank-one matrix $Z = f f^\\dagger$ rather than estimating $f$ directly. We propose simple quantum circuits for estimating the entries of $Z$ and show that measuring only a narrow band of this matrix around the diagonal is sufficient to uniquely recover $f$. Crucially, this reformulation decouples the controlled circuit depth from the maximum evolution time to scale instead with the width of the measured band. We prove that a $O(1)$ bandwidth suffices for generic signals, leading to substantial savings in controlled operations compared to direct estimation methods. We develop three recovery algorithms with provable exact recovery in the noiseless setting and stability under measurement noise. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that high-quality recovery is possible for the 2D Fermi-Hubbard and 2D transverse-field Ising model signals of size exceeding 100 time points using only a few million measurement shots and reasonable post-processing time, making our time-series estimation techniques efficient and effective for near-term implementations."}

We show that graviton detection probabilities enable the discrimination between squeezed, coherent, and thermal radiation. We further demonstrate that the full quantum statistics contained in the second-order correlation function of the passing wave can be directly measured at the detector, independent of the weak gravitational interaction strength. Building on recent quantum-optical techniques, this capability opens the way to full quantum state tomography of Gaussian states.

We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced."}

The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary.

In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points."}

We introduce an extended TE-QPINN (x-TE-QPINN) architecture that supports both classical and fully quantum embeddings, enabling a controlled comparison between feedforward neural network-based feature maps and parameterized quantum circuit embeddings. The first architecture is the classical embedding feed-forward neural network-based TE-QPINN (FNN-TE-QPINN), while the latter variant is a purely quantum one, referred to as quantum embedding neural network-based TE-QPINN (QNN-TE-QPINN). The proposed framework employs hardware-efficient variational quantum circuits and species-specific readout operators to approximate coupled multi-field dynamics while enforcing governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions through a physics-informed loss function. By isolating the embedding mechanism while keeping the variational ansatz, loss formulation, and optimization procedure fixed, we analyze the impact of embedding design on gradient structure, parameter scaling, and quantum resource requirements. Numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional RD equations demonstrate that quantum embeddings can replace classical embeddings without degradation in solution accuracy and, in certain regimes, exhibit improved optimization behavior compared to classical PINNs and hybrid quantum models with fixed embeddings. These results provide architectural insight into hybrid quantum PDE solvers and inform the design of resource-efficient quantum physics-informed learning methods."}

We find that an initially unentangled spin-state can evolve into an entangled state. This is contrary to the common case when coupling a quantum system to hot degrees of freedom leads to loss of entanglement and not its generation. Moreover, we show that the generated entanglement is technologically useful as it, in principle, can enhance the sensitivity of measurements beyond the standard quantum limit.

The environment is driven linearly in time across its quantum critical points (QCPs) and, during the evolution, is subjected to quantum reset (QR), where it is returned at random times to its initial state. We investigate how such QR of the environmental spin chain modifies the dynamics of entanglement and quantum discord between the qubits. Our results show that in the strong-coupling regime, entanglement and discord exhibit pronounced revivals within the interval bounded by the Ising QCPs, but these revivals diminish as the QR rate increases. In contrast, weak coupling leads to a monotonic reduction of quantum correlations. Numerically, we find that the revival peaks of concurrence decay and scale exponentially with the QR rate, while quantum discord shows no clear scaling behavior. In the weak-coupling regime without QR, the correlations decay monotonically as the driven field crosses the second QCP. When QR is applied, however, both entanglement and discord undergo oscillatory suppression, with the oscillation period increasing as either the QR rate or the ramp time scale is reduced."}

Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery."}

In the years since, subsequent papers on weak values have produced a number of important practical spin-offs, including new methods for signal amplification and quantum-state tomography. The present work is not concerned with those practical spin-offs, but with historical and ongoing attempts to assign weak values a transparent, single-system interpretation, as well as efforts that invoke weak values to make a number of exotic claims about the properties and behavior of individual quantum systems.

We show that in quantum illumination, the achievable advantage is determined by an interplay between initial entanglement and discord. First, we rigorously show that the quantum advantage for a given state equals the amount of discord consumed for illumination. Subsequently, we find that states with identical initial discord can lead to varying advantages, indicating that the usable portion of discord for illumination depends on additional structural features of the state. Then, we consider the relation between the advantage and both entanglement and discord by performing a conditional extremal analysis. To this end, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial discord, we compute the maximum and minimum initial entanglement within each cluster. We demonstrate that, for states with fixed initial discord, the maximum (and not minimum) entanglement increases by increment of the advantage. We conclude that for any given initial discord, higher entanglement is a sufficient (but not necessary) resource for higher advantage. On the other hand, for states clustered by identical advantage and initial entanglement, we compute the maximum and minimum initial discord in each group. Here, the minimum (and not always maximum) discord scales monotonically with advantage. It shows that, for fixed initial entanglement, higher discord is a necessary (but not always sufficient) resource for higher advantage. This result provides a refined, operational perspective on how different forms of quantum correlations govern the performance of the illumination protocol. We finally find a persistent linear dependence of the advantage on initial discord in the high-noise regime, highlighting discord as the key resource for resilience to noise in the protocol."}

Fundamentally, this challenge arises from the lack of strong non-linearities on the single-photon level, meaning that photonic state preparation based on linear optics cannot benefit from the deterministic gate-based approach available to other physical platforms. Instead, the preparation of quantum states can be probabilistically implemented using single photons, linear-optical networks, and photon detection. However, determining whether an input state can be transformed into a target state using a specific measurement pattern - a problem that can be mapped to deciding the feasibility of a system of polynomial equations - is a complex problem in general. To solve it, we apply the Nullstellensatz Linear Algebra algorithm from algebraic geometry to quantum state generation; this can provide definitive no-go results by proving infeasibility when the state preparation task in question has no solution. We demonstrate this capability to validate and establish lower bounds on the physical resource requirements for the realization of several ubiquitous optical states and gates."}

A renewal formulation links slot-level success probability to long-run average FA, enabling a stochastic control problem that minimizes FA under budget and memory limits. Two lightweight schedulers, FA-THR and FA-INDEX, approximate Lyapunov-drift-optimal control.

Using the formalism of higher-order operations, we develop an algorithm that looks for the optimal solution, and we provide an efficient numerical implementation based on semidefinite programming. Our benchmark examples, specifically those against existing analytical solutions, demonstrate how powerful and precise our method is. We further explore the potential of greedy adaptive strategies, which are based on classical feedforward to design the optimal protocol for the next round. Using this framework, we compare the optimal achievable Bayesian score across classes. We demonstrate the strength of our algorithm in several examples, from single to multiparameter estimation and with various prior distributions. Particularly, we find examples in which there is a strict hierarchy between different classes. Nonetheless, the performance of the different quantum memory-assisted classes are not significantly different, while they may significantly outperform the adaptive greedy strategy."}

A central feature of QACG is a controllable decomposition of the condition number between the quantum and the classical solver, enabling flexible allocation of computational effort across quantum and classical resources. Under explicit architectural assumptions, we identify regimes in which this cooperative strategy yields a runtime advantage over purely classical approaches while requiring substantially fewer quantum resources than end-to-end quantum linear solvers.

However, such a method generally requires exponentially many sampling copies due to the large magic of the target state. This work proposes a sample- and gate-efficient fidelity estimation algorithm that is affordable within feasible quantum devices. We show that the fidelity estimation with pure states close to the structure of phase states, for which sample-efficient DFE is limited by their strong entanglement and magic, can be done by using $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ sampling copies, with a single $n$-qubit fan-out gate.

Such a drastic improvement stems from a crucial step in our scheme, the so-called phase stripping, which can significantly reduce the target-state magic. Furthermore, we convert a complex diagonal gate resource, which is needed to design a phase-stripping-adapted algorithm, into nonlinear classical post-processing of Pauli measurements so that we only require a single fan-out gate. Additionally, as another variant using the nonlinear post-processing, we propose a nonlinear extension of the conventional DFE scheme. Here, the sampling reduction compared to DFE is also guaranteed, while preserving the Pauli measurement as the only circuit resource. We expect our work to contribute to establishing noise-resilient quantum algorithms by enabling a significant reduction in sampling overhead for fidelity estimation under the restricted gate resources, and ultimately to clarifying a fundamental gap between the resource overhead required to understand complex physical properties and that required to generate them."}

In this work, we present a unified framework that explains CSC in any non-Hermitian system, encompassing non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, Lindblad, and hybrid settings. Our framework relies on perturbative, non-adiabatic corrections to adiabatic evolution and consistently predicts CSC with only the lowest-order corrections. We demonstrate its efficacy with models of single and coupled dissipative qubits, obtaining analytical solutions for the conversion fidelity. Our analysis further reveals the role of non-perturbative dynamics, which can be present even in apparently slow trajectories. We show that this property can be utilised to considerably enhance state conversion. Finally, we demonstrate that CSC can be observed in a model without the presence of exceptional points."}

The classical multinomial is recovered when all photons enter through a single port, the coherent sum degenerating to a single term with no interference; the quantum family is not a generalization in the Askey sense but a parallel family that departs from classical statistics through the coherence of the amplitude summation. The $r$-th factorial moment carries a squared multinomial coefficient in place of the classical single one, the extra factor arising from the two copies of the amplitude expansion whose indices the Fock state forces to agree; for the beam splitter, the third cumulant is invariant under bosonic interference and the quantum departure first appears in the fourth cumulant as negative excess kurtosis; for multiport interferometers, however, three-body interference breaks this invariance and the departure enters already at the third cumulant. Cross-mode covariances involve the phases of the scattering matrix through coherence terms that strengthen output anti-correlations beyond the classical value; together with the squared-coefficient signature in the single-mode moments, these provide low-order statistical witnesses for boson sampling verification without requiring the full permanent computation."}

We derive exact, analytical complementarity relations quantifying this conversion, link the decay of local coherence directly to the growth of entanglement, and support these findings with numerical simulations. Our results clarify the underlying mechanism and establish gravity as a coherence-to-entanglement conversion channel, offering a refined interpretive basis for forthcoming experimental tests. Crucially, we show that initial coherence is a necessary condition for entanglement generation and that its degree bounds the maximum achievable entanglement, with maximal entanglement requiring initial maximal coherence."}

Here, by investigating how local dissipative environments coupled separately to each qubit affect the steering properties geometrized by the QSE within an exact non-Markovian framework, we find that the geometry of each party's QSE is closely tied to whether a bound state forms in the energy spectrum of the total qubit-environment system. We systematically examine the characteristics of QSEs under three distinct scenarios: two-sided bound states, one-sided bound states, and no bound state, revealing a diverse range of steering types.

This bistable phase is characterized by the coexistence of superradiant and antiferromagnetic orders, and it converts a ground-state triple point into a tetracritical point, at which the boundaries of the first- and second-order transitions intersect.

We show that this indistinguishability, together with probability normalization and action additivity, selects complex amplitudes and unitary evolution as the minimal continuous representation compatible with action additivity, probability normalization, and inference under finite resolution. Quantum interference and unitarity therefore emerge as consequences of these assumptions rather than independent postulates. From the resulting propagator, the Lagrangian, Hilbert-space structure, and Schrödinger equation follow as derived consequences. In the infinitesimal-time limit, action differences universally fall below the resolution scale, making coherent summation the minimal consistent description at every step.

The formulation applies to all systems -- large and small, with many or few particles -- and to all states, whether equilibrium or nonequilibrium, by relying on carefully stated operational definitions and existence principles rather than macroscopic idealizations. Key thermodynamic concepts, including adiabatic availability and available energy, are developed and illustrated using the energy-entropy diagram representation of nonequilibrium states, which provides geometric insight into irreversibility and the limits of work extraction for systems of any size. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the analysis of entropy transfer in non-work interactions, leading to precise definitions of heat interactions and heat-and-diffusion interactions of central importance in mesoscopic continuum theories of nonequilibrium behavior in simple and complex solids and fluids. As a direct consequence of this analysis, Clausius inequalities and the Clausius statement of the second law are derived in forms explicitly extended to nonequilibrium processes.

While integrability is known to survive in static and periodically driven systems, its fate in the complete absence of time-translation symmetry, particularly in interacting random quantum circuits, has remained unclear. Here we construct integrable random quantum circuits built from inhomogeneous XXZ R-matrices. Remarkably, integrability is preserved for arbitrary sequences of gate layers, ranging from quasiperiodic to fully random, thereby explicitly breaking both continuous and discrete time-translation symmetry. Using large-scale time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group simulations at infinite temperature and half filling, we map out the resulting spin-transport phase diagram and identify ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes controlled by the spectral parameters of the R-matrices. The spatiotemporal structure of spin correlations within each regime depends sensitively on the inhomogeneity, exhibiting spatial asymmetry and sharp peak structures tied to near-degenerate quasiparticle velocities. To account for these findings, we develop a generalized hydrodynamics framework adapted to time-dependent integrable circuits, yielding Euler-scale predictions for correlation functions, Drude weights, and diffusion bounds. This approach identifies the quasiparticles governing transport and quantitatively captures both the scaling exponents and fine structures of the correlation profiles observed numerically.

However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits.

This correspondence allows us to theoretically ground the robustness of edge flows in classical chiral systems using the bulk-boundary correspondence of Floquet topological insulators. Our results provide a discrete microscopic description for odd diffusion, offering a powerful toolkit to predict transport in confined geometries and disordered chiral media."}
