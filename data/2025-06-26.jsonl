Inspired by recent\nexperimental developments, we derive a quantum master equation that describes\nnanoelectromechanical systems in a generally overlooked situation: when the\nelectronic transport is slower than the natural frequency of the oscillator.\nHere, a semi-classical model is no longer valid and we develop the missing\nfully quantum approach. Moreover, we go beyond the wide-band limit and study\nthe consequence of maintaining energy dependent tunneling rates, which are\nrequired to describe effects found in real devices. To benchmark our results,\nwe compare with numerically exact results obtained with the hierarchical\nequations of motion method, and find overall good agreements in the\nexperimentally accessible steady state regime. Furthermore, we derive from the\nmicroscopic model a ready to use particle current expression that replicates\nfeatures already observed experimentally."}
