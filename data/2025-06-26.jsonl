Our setup\napplies an unknown rotation and a known orbital angular momentum increase in a\ncoherently controlled order, in a way that reproduces a hybrid quantum SWITCH\ninvolving gates generated by both discrete and continuous variables.

SQC addresses this by\nefficient inter-processor transfer of information through bias fields.\nConsequently, measurement outcomes from one quantum processor are encoded in\nthe initial-state preparation of the subsequent quantum computer. We\nexperimentally validate SQC by solving a combinatorial optimization problem\nwith interactions up to three-body terms. A D-Wave quantum annealer utilizing\n678 qubits approximately solves the problem, and an IBM's 156-qubit digital\nquantum processor subsequently refines the obtained solutions.
