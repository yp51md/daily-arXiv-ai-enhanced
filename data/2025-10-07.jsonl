Recent advances in statistical\nphysics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise\ncharacterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in\ninformation-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent\ncontrol protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that\nminimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we\ndevelop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation\nresponse relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that\noptimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both\nusing FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on\niteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much\neasier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing\nequations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a\ndouble-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to\nconstruct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The\nframework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by\noptimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system.

The resulting\nmoir\\'e superlattice potential modulates the electronic band structure, leading\nto emergent topological phases and novel transport properties such as quantized\npiezo responses both for spin and charge transport. This approach allows us to\ntune the system across different topological regimes and to explore the\npiezo-spintronic responses as a function of the band topology. When inversion\nsymmetry is broken either by a sublattice potential $V$, alignment with an hBN\nsubstrate, uniaxial strain, or structural asymmetry present in the moir\\'e\nsuperlattice, the system acquires a finite Berry curvature that is opposite in\nthe $K$ and $K'$ valleys (protected by valley time reversal symmetry).

Of particular interest\nis whether the 1/2 FQHS in this system has a one-component (1C) or\ntwo-component (2C) origin; these are typically identified as the Pfaffian\n(non-Abelian) or the $\\Psi_{331}$ (Abelian) FQHSs, respectively. We report here\nour experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an\nultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well.

As the density is\nincreased, a FQHS emerges at $\\nu = 1/2$, and becomes very strong. In a finite\ndensity range where the 1/2 FQHS is strongest, we also observe its daughter\nFQHSs at $\\nu = 8/17$ and 7/13, consistent with the theoretically expected\ndaughter states of a Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS. At the highest densities, the 2DES\nbecomes 2C, signaled by the emergence of a bilayer Wigner crystal state and the\ntransitions of FQHSs flanking $\\nu=1/2$. The 1/2 FQHS remains robust near this\ntransition and, notably, its charge transport energy gap exhibits an\n\\textit{upward} cusp with a maximum value of about 6 K on the 1C side of the\ntransition; this is the largest gap reported for any even-denominator FQHS. Our\nobservation of the transition of the 2DES ground states near $\\nu=1/2$ to 2C\nstates at high densities, and our measurements of the robustness of the 1/2\nFQHS against charge distribution asymmetry, suggest that the 1/2 FQHS also\nmakes a transition from 1C to 2C.

To develop a full hierarchy of quantum resources, beyond those first two\norders, and to account for the fact that quantum protocols can interconvert\nresources of different orders, we need a theoretical framework that addresses\nall orders in a uniform manner. We introduce a framework based on a system of\ntypes, which label the different kinds of objects that are present at different\norders. We equip the framework with a parallel product operation that modifies\nand generalizes the tensor product so as to be operationally meaningful for\nmaps of distinct and arbitrary orders. Finally, we introduce a family of convex\ncones that generalize the notion of complete positivity to all orders, with the\naim of characterizing the objects that are physically admissible, facilitating\nan operational treatment of quantum objects at any order."}

This allows direct access to the\ncommuting two-photon correlators \\langle \\sigma_z \\otimes \\sigma_z \\rangle and\n\\langle \\sigma_y \\otimes \\sigma_y \\rangle required for entanglement witnessing.\nThe metasurface design employs meta-atoms engineered to impart independent\nlinear and circular phase delays through anisotropy and geometric control,\nresulting in polarization-dependent beam deflection that separates H/V and R/L\ncomponents. This approach halves the measurement overhead compared to\nsequential analysis while offering a compact, integrable platform for\nchip-scale quantum photonics. The proposed scheme provides a path toward\nefficient entanglement verification with applications in quantum key\ndistribution, quantum repeaters, and scalable quantum networks."}

In this work\nwe articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated\nelectronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the\nelectromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the\nmaterial system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we\nfocus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic\nFermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often\nenergetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may\nform, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the\nelectromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the\nCasimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular\norientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the\ninterplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic\nelectromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal\nnematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the\nanisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$\ntimes larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes.\nThis finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with\ncurrently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the\nCasimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by\ndiscussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum\nHall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of\ncompeting correlated electronic phases."}

Here, we present\na systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant\nclusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In\nsingle-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are\nhydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations,\nexcept in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit\noscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled\nsuppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting\nthis feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum\narsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin\nthat scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the\ntight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging\nfrom finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two\ndimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net\nspin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic\nlimit, including one which achieves over $70\\%$ polarization. Our results\nprovide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in\nsemiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for\ntheir experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants."}

In particular, we focus on Abelian\ntopological order in two dimensions, which spontaneously breaks a 1-form\nsymmetry. Using the toric code as a primary example, we compute the\nentanglement asymmetry and compare it to the topological entanglement entropy.\nWe find that while the two quantities are not strictly equivalent, both are\nsub-leading corrections to the area law and can serve as order parameters for\nthe topological phase. We generalize our results to non-chiral Abelian\ntopological order and express the maximal entanglement asymmetry in terms of\nthe quantum dimension. Finally, we discuss how the scaling of entanglement\nasymmetry correctly detects topological order in the deformed toric code, where\n1-form symmetry breaking persists even in a trivial phase."}

Please reach out to the\n  corresponding author via email", "summary": "We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a\nfamily of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians\nthat can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve\nintegrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and\npinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics.\nWe demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse\nfield and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive\nfrequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also\nprovide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new\ndynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and\nparamagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them.\nFinite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent\nsubharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges\nexponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for\nrealizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their\nexperimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this\nwork stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that\nrely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived\nplateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore\nhighly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an\nattractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and\nconstrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our\nconstruction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range\nNNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal\nfragility of disordered realizations."}

The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet\nfinite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using\npurification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected\nentangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite\ntemperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to\none tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the\nlattice sites.

In this work\nwe articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated\nelectronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the\nelectromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the\nmaterial system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we\nfocus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic\nFermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often\nenergetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may\nform, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the\nelectromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the\nCasimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular\norientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the\ninterplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic\nelectromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal\nnematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the\nanisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$\ntimes larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes.\nThis finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with\ncurrently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the\nCasimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by\ndiscussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum\nHall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of\ncompeting correlated electronic phases."}
