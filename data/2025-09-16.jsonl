In near-term\narchitectures with constrained hardware, effective control may determine the\nfeasibility of deploying such applications. Because quantum network dynamics\nare suitable for being modeled as a Markov decision process, dynamic\nprogramming and reinforcement learning (RL) offer promising tools for\noptimizing control strategies. However, key quantum network performance\nmeasures -- such as secret key rate in quantum key distribution -- often\ninvolve a non-linear relationship, with interdependent variables that describe\nquantum state quality and generation rate. Such objectives are not easily\ncaptured by standard RL approaches based on additive rewards. We propose a\nnovel RL framework that directly optimizes non-linear, differentiable objective\nfunctions, while also accounting for uncertainties introduced by classical\ncommunication delays. We evaluate this framework in the context of entanglement\ndistillation between two quantum network nodes equipped with multiplexing\ncapability, and find that, in certain parameter regimes, it discovers policies\nthat outperform heuristic baselines. Our work comprises the first step towards\nnon-linear objective function optimization in quantum networks with RL, opening\na path towards more advanced use cases."}

This Thesis explores emergent cooperative phenomena in\ncollective light-matter systems. We study ensembles of interacting quantum\nemitters coherently driven by a laser field and coupled to photonic structures,\nfocusing on the hybrid description of emitters dressed by light. The interplay\namong quantum emitters, coherent driving, and photonic environments reveals a\nrich landscape of cooperative effects. While single-emitter dressing has been\nwidely studied, we address collective phenomena in two non-identical emitters\nmodelled as two-level systems. Strong interaction forms a dimer exhibiting\nsuperradiant and subradiant states, with two-photon resonances directly\nconnecting ground and doubly excited states. This nonlinear process, central to\nthe Thesis, enables new regimes of cooperative light-matter physics. Analytical\nstudies show how interactions reshape observables such as emission intensity,\nphoton statistics, and spectra, offering implications for quantum metrology.\nThe sensitivity of two-photon processes to emitter distance and driving\nstrength enables high-precision sensing and sub-wavelength imaging.\nUnexpectedly, we find that off-resonant virtual states may gain population\nthrough dissipation, redefining their role in open systems. To capture this, we\ndevelop a hierarchical adiabatic elimination method for metastable dynamics. We\nalso analyze entanglement in emitters coupled to a lossy cavity, identifying\nfive mechanisms, including the frequency-resolved Purcell effect introduced\nhere. This selective enhancement stabilizes cooperative states and enables\nscalable entanglement. Our models, tailored to solid-state platforms such as\nquantum dots and molecular aggregates, address challenges like inhomogeneous\nbroadening and decoherence, demonstrating the feasibility of harnessing\ncooperative light-matter effects for quantum technologies."}

Reaching this scale is\ndifficult, requiring confinement in single or multiple pores with nanometer\nradii. Porous silicates such as MCM-41 have a pore radius larger than the\ncoherence length of 4He, and in this work we systematically explore the\npossibility of pre-plating pores with different elements to reduce the pore\nsize without localizing the confined superfluid. Through a direct solution of\nthe few-body Schrodinger equation combined with quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we explore the behavior of helium confined inside cylindrical\nnanopores for a range of pre-plating elements, including rare gases and alkali\nmetals. For rare gases, we find that helium remains strongly attracted to the\npore walls and any atoms in the core form an incompressible liquid. For alkali\nmetals such as Cs, weak interactions between helium and the pre-plating\nmaterial prevent localization near the walls and enable delocalization in the\npore center. Our results extend previous results for helium wetting on flat two\ndimensional coated substrates to the curved geometry inside nanopores, and\ndemonstrate that alkali pre-plated nanopores may enable a tunable\none-dimensional confined quantum liquid of helium."}

Localized nonadiabatic coupling breaks the symmetry of\nthe dynamics and produces a directed trajectory: after only a few early\npassages through the conical intersection region, the packet proceeds toward\nthe target with high fidelity. In contrast, in the Born-Oppenheimer limit,\nwhere such coupling is absent, the optimized control yields symmetric,\nmulti-cycle oscillations rather than a comparably directed displacement. While\nboth approaches reach the target at the chosen final time, the underlying\ntrajectories are qualitatively different. This work demonstrates that\nengineered conical intersections can serve as a new control resource for\ndirectional motional dynamics, complementing pulse-shaping methods in\ntrapped-ion systems.

Using this\nparadigm, several smaller QPUs can collectively execute circuits that each\nwould not be able on its own. However, communication between QPUs is costly as\nit requires generating and maintaining entanglement, and hence it should be\nused wisely. In this paper, we evaluate the architectures, and in particular\nthe entanglement patterns, of variational quantum circuits in a distributed\nquantum computing (DQC) setting. That is, using Qiskit, we simulate the\nexecution of an eight qubit circuit using four QPUs each with two computational\nand two communication qubits where non-local CX-gates are performed using the\nremote-CX protocol. We compare the performance of various circuits on a binary\nclassification task where training is executed under ideal and testing under\nnoisy conditions. The study provides initial results on suitable VQC\narchitectures for the DQC paradigm, and indicates that a standard VQC baseline\nis not always the best choice, and alternative architectures that use\nentanglement between QPUs sparingly deliver better results under noise."}

Yet, SIE bounds only total\nentanglement, leaving open the fine entanglement structure. In this work, we\nintroduce Spectral-Entangling Strength, measuring the structural entangling\npower of an operator, and prove a Spectral SIE theorem: a universal limit for\nR\\'enyi entanglement growth at $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$\ntail in the entanglement spectrum. At $\\alpha=1/2$ the bound is qualitatively\nand quantitatively optimal, identifying the universal threshold beyond which\ngrowth is unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt\ncoefficients, enabling rigorous truncation-based error control and linking\nentanglement to computational complexity. Our framework further establishes a\ngeneralized entanglement area law under adiabatic paths, extending a central\nprinciple of many-body physics to general interactions.
