The chirality-induced spin selectivity\n(CISS) effect, where chiral materials preferentially transmit electrons of a\nparticular spin, has sparked intense interest and debate regarding its\nunderlying mechanism. Despite extensive research, the spatial distribution of\nspin polarization in chiral systems, the key evidence to reveal the spin\nscattering mechanism in CISS, has remained experimentally elusive particularly\ndue to complications arising from spin-orbit coupling in metal electrodes\ntypically used in such studies. Here we show, through reflective magnetic\ncircular dichroism measurements on chiral tellurium nanowires with graphene\nelectrodes, that current-induced spin polarization exhibits identical signs in\nboth the nanowire and electrodes, distinct from the presumed spin filter\nscenario. The observed spin polarization scales linearly with current\namplitude, aligns parallel to the current direction, reverses with chirality or\ncurrent flow, and demonstrates spin relaxation lengths of several micrometers\ninto graphene. Our findings provide the first direct visualization of spatial\nspin distribution in chiral devices.

HBARs demonstrate several very sharp\nresonance modes distributed nearly periodically over a very wide frequency\nrange. This spectrum response of HBARs offers unique advantages but poses\nsignificant modeling challenges. The proposed circuit incorporates and models\nthe unique physical components of the HBAR: piezoelectric transducer, substrate\n(a perfectly periodic multimode cavity), piezoelectric coupling, and\ncritically, the imperfectly matched transducer-substrate interface which\nimparts characteristic aperiodicity to the HBAR mode spectrum. By judicious use\nof fixed, periodic, or tightly constrained virtual lumped-element branches, and\nsets of branches, the model retains clear and intuitive links to the physical\ndevice, while reducing the complexity needed for fitting dense, broadband\ndatasets. We demonstrate the validity and power of this model by simultaneously\nfitting measured data for 61 modes of a GaN/NbN/sapphire HBAR over a span of 1\nGHz, and extracting modal parameters such as quality factors and coupling\ncoefficients. We show that this new model is compact and yet scalable: by\nleveraging the inherent internal relationships in an HBAR, the model can be\neasily expanded to include multiple transducer overtones and envelopes,\nmultiple distinct transducers, and spurious modes. In addition to fitting\nmeasured datasets, the new model can also be used to easily analyze various\nperturbations to the nominal state of the HBAR. We expect the new model to be\nuseful for the design of classical HBAR-based oscillators, filters, and\nsensors, and for the integration of HBARs into quantum circuits."}

The diagonal component of this metric defines a\nsusceptibility of the QRE that diverges at quantum critical points (QCPs) in\nthe thermodynamic limit. We study two spin-$1/2$ models as examples, namely the\nintegrable transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and a non-integrable Ising chain\nwith three-spin interactions. We demonstrate distinct scaling behaviors for the\npeak of the QRE susceptibility as a function of $N$: namely a square\nlogarithmic divergence in TFIM and a power-law divergence in the non-integrable\nchain. This susceptibility encodes uncertainty of entanglement Hamiltonian\ngradients and is also directly connected to other information measures such as\nPetz-R\\'enyi entropies. We further show that this susceptibility diverges even\nat finite $N$ if the subsystem size, $n$, exceeds a certain value when the\nHamiltonian is tuned to its classical limits due to the rank of the RDMs being\nfinite; unlike the divergence associated with the QCPs which require $N\n\\rightarrow \\infty$."}

In this work,\nwe explore the fully quantum analogue, where the amplitude of a coherent\nquantized field is estimated by letting it interact with a two-level atom.

Several approaches have\nbeen developed for optimal control of quantum states, whereas optimal\nstrategies for preparation of a given quantum process have remained fairly less\nexplored.

In such cases, fidelity-based\nmeasures alone are inadequate for evaluating the performance of a quantum\ncontrol strategy, and hence proper feature-based figures of merit should be\nemployed.
