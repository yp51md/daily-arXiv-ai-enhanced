### [1] [Two-photon coupling via Josephson element II: Interaction renormalizations and cross-Kerr coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13427)
*Eugene V. Stolyarov,V. L. Andriichuk,Andrii M. Sokolov*

Main category: quant-ph

Abstract: We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum
interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the
anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can
switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled
resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable
well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial
atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings,
interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the
two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant
interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the
coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual
processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of
metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.

Abstract: We develop a general framework for classifying fermionic dynamical systems
with measurements using symmetry and topology. We discuss two complementary
classification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the
many-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic
dynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and
(2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies
free-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson
localization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in
one-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of
area-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical
bulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime
\textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state
ensemble living on its temporal \textit{boundary}. Building on this
correspondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical
phases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and
stabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in
\textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local
operations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with
finite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a
demonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that
realize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range
versions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in $\mathcal{O}(1)$
circuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and
dynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in
this symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit
protocol to coherent noise.

Motivation: 探索相对论性量子场中多体纠缠的非微扰特性，特别是双体和三体纠缠的生成条件。

Method: 采用可解相对论性自旋-玻色子模型（Unruh-DeWitt探测器模型的静态形式），分析两到三个发射器的纠缠生成。

Result: （i）双发射器高度纠缠需深入光锥的相互作用；（ii）场质量通常改善纠缠生成；（iii）三体纠缠生成非微扰困难。

Conclusion: 非微扰探测相对论性量子场的多体纠缠需新方法或模型变体，同时提供了N发射器模型在Fock空间中基态的正则条件。

Abstract: We study non-perturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three
emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model,
equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector
model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require
interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can
generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) unlike the bipartite
case where it is possible to generate close to maximally entangled states via
the spin-boson interactions, the generation of genuine tripartite entanglement
is non-perturbatively hard even at sufficiently long times. Result (iii), in
particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a
relativistic quantum field non-perturbatively requires either different
probe-based techniques or variants of the UDW model. Along the way we provide
the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground
states in the Fock space.

Abstract: We investigate qubits coupled to the boundary of a two dimensional photonic
lattice that supports dispersionless edge modes, unlike conventional edge modes
that sustain propagating photons. As a case study, we consider a honeycomb
lattice (photonic graphene) of coupled resonators with a zigzag edge, where the
edge modes form a flat band defined only over a restricted region of momentum
space. We show that light matter interactions are effectively captured by a
dissipative cavity QED model, wherein the emitter coherently couples to a
fictitious cavity mode emerging as a superposition of edge modes. This mode has
support on only one sublattice and, most notably, displays an unconventional
power law localization around the qubit, yet remaining normalizable in the
thermodynamic limit, with a spatial range that can be tuned by introducing
lattice anisotropy We predict occurrence of vacuum Rabi oscillations and
efficient state transfer between distant emitters. An experimental
demonstration using superconducting circuits is proposed.

### [5] [Scalable suppression of heating errors in large trapped-ion quantum processors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13457)
*Zixuan Huo,Yangchao Shen,Xiao Yuan,Xiao-Ming Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

Result: 在多达55个量子比特的系统中，数值模拟显示误差降低了约一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模囚禁离子量子计算提供了实用且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Trapped-ion processors are leading candidates for scalable quantum
computation. However, motional heating remains a key obstacle to fault-tolerant
operation, especially when system size increases. Heating error is particularly
challenging to suppress due to is incoherence nature, and no general methods
currently exist for mitigating their impact even in systems with more than two
ions. In this work, based on a careful analysis about the dependence of
heating-induced infidelity on phase-space trajectories, we present a simple yet
comprehensive framework for suppressing heating errors in large trapped-ion
quantum processors. Our approach is flexible, allowing various control pulse
bases, ion numbers, and noise levels. Our approach is also compatible with
existing error-mitigation techniques, including those targeting laser phase and
frequency noise. Crucially, it relies on an efficiently computable cost
function that avoids the exponential overhead of full fidelity estimation. We
perform numerical simulations for systems with up to 55 qubits, demonstrating
up to an order-of-magnitude reduction in infidelities. These results offer a
practical route toward robust, large-scale quantum computation with trapped
ions.

*ChunJun Cao,Brad Lackey*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过连接小规模量子重复码构建量子LDPC码及其稀疏子系统码的方法，提出了一种高效迭代算法，并证明其能渐进满足最坏情况下的距离保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是解决如何通过连接小规模量子码系统性地构建具有有限Tanner图度数且距离可扩展的量子LDPC码及其稀疏子系统码。

Method: 采用量子Lego形式中引入的“连接”方法，通过连接量子重复码构建量子LDPC码，并提出一种高效迭代算法构建稀疏子系统码。

Result: 证明了仅连接量子重复码即可构造量子LDPC码，且算法能渐进满足$kd^2=O(n)$的距离保证。此外，连接双量子比特重复码可生成任何CSS码。

Conclusion: 通过创造性组合基本码块，可以生成高质量的量子码，包括量子LDPC码。

Abstract: It is generally unclear whether smaller codes can be "concatenated" to
systematically create quantum LDPC codes or their sparse subsystem code cousins
where the degree of the Tanner graph remains bounded while increasing the code
distance. In this work, we use a slight generalization of concatenation called
conjoining introduced by the quantum lego formalism. We show that by conjoining
only quantum repetition codes, one can construct quantum LDPC codes. More
generally, we provide an efficient iterative algorithm for constructing sparse
subsystem codes with a distance guarantee that asymptotically saturates
$kd^2=O(n)$ in the worst case. Furthermore, we show that the conjoining of even
just two-qubit quantum bit-flip and phase-flip repetition codes is quite
powerful as they can create any CSS code. Therefore, more creative combinations
of these basic code blocks will be sufficient for generating good quantum
codes, including good quantum LDPC codes.

Abstract: The integration of quantum computing and machine learning has emerged as a
promising frontier in computational science. We present a hybrid protocol which
combines classical neural networks with non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum
many-body system for image classification. This architecture leverages
classical neural networks to efficiently process high-dimensional data and
encode it effectively on a quantum many-body system, overcoming a challenging
task towards scaled up quantum computation. The quantum module further
capitalizes on the discriminative properties of many-body quantum dynamics to
enhance classification accuracy. By mapping images from distinct classes to
nearly-orthogonal quantum states, the system maximizes separability in the
Hilbert space, enabling robust classification. We evaluate the performance of
our model on several benchmark datasets with various number of features and
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate the key role of the quantum module in
achieving high classification accuracy which cannot be accomplished by the
classical neural network alone. This showcases the potential of our hybrid
protocol for achieving practical quantum advantage and paves the way for future
advancements in quantum-enhanced computational techniques.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum computers have emerged as a leading platform for
next-generation computing, offering exceptional scalability and unprecedented
computational speeds. However, scaling these systems to millions of qubits for
practical applications poses substantial challenges, particularly due to
interconnect bottlenecks. To address this challenge, extensive research has
focused on developing cryogenic multiplexers that enable minimal wiring between
room-temperature electronics and quantum processors. This paper investigates
the viability of commercial microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches for
cryogenic multiplexers in large-scale quantum computing systems. DC and RF
characteristics of the MEMS switches are evaluated at cryogenic temperatures (<
10 K) through finite element simulations and experimental measurements. Our
results demonstrate that MEMS switches exhibit improved on-resistance, lower
operating voltage, and superior RF performance at cryogenic temperatures, with
reliable operation over 100 million cycles. Furthermore, stable single-pole
four-throw (SP4T) switching and logical operations, including NAND and NOR
gates, are demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures, validating their potential
for quantum computing. These results underscore the promise of MEMS switches in
realizing large-scale quantum computing systems.

Conclusion: 机器学习是探测量子系统环境特征和推动量子噪声光谱学的有力工具。

Abstract: We present a machine learning-based approach for characterising the
environment that affects the dynamics of an open quantum system. We focus on
the case of an exactly solvable spin-boson model, where the system-environment
interaction, whose strength is encoded in the spectral density, induces pure
dephasing. By using artificial neural networks trained on the
Fourier-transformed time evolution of some observables of the system, we
perform both classification -- distinguishing sub-Ohmic, Ohmic, and super-Ohmic
spectral densities -- and regression -- thus estimating key parameters of the
spectral density function, when the latter is expressed through a power law.
Our results demonstrate high classification accuracy and robust parameter
estimation, highlighting the potential of machine learning as a powerful tool
for probing environmental features in quantum systems and advancing quantum
noise spectroscopy.

Result: 在短程关联态和典型噪声实验条件下，该方法被证明是高效的，并在96个量子比特的超导量子处理器中成功验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模量子实验提供了一种高效的MPO学习方案，扩展了经典阴影的应用范围。

Abstract: We present and test a protocol to learn the matrix-product operator (MPO)
representation of an experimentally prepared quantum state. The protocol takes
as an input classical shadows corresponding to local randomized measurements,
and outputs the tensors of a MPO which maximizes a suitably-defined fidelity
with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out
sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group
algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical
conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in
typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide
an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the
experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning
entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum
processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum
computation and simulation experiments.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了有限熵态在幺正动力学中最大熵原理和深度热化的表现，为相关理论提供了新视角。

Abstract: The notion of $deep$ $thermalisation$, where ensembles of pure states on a
local subsystem, conditioned on measurement outcomes on its complement,
approach universal maximum-entropy ensembles constrained only by conservation
laws, represents a stronger form of ergodicity than conventional
thermalisation. We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed
initial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness.
To address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed
states, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our
formulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees
of freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with
the ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial
state. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic,
locally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain,
which we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we
find exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at
finite times. Our results therefore lead to fundamental insights into how
maximum entropy principles and deep thermalisation manifest themselves in
unitary dynamics of states with finite entropy.

Conclusion: 前向时间动力学避免了逆因果性，同时保持了与原始模型相同的轨迹解。

Abstract: A recently proposed stochastic hidden variable model for quantum mechanics
has been claimed to involve "retrocausality" due to the appearance of equations
of motion with future-time boundary conditions. We formulate an equivalent
system of forward-time equations of motion that gives rise to the same
trajectories as solutions, but involves only initial-time boundary conditions.
The forward-time dynamics involves a guidance term for the dynamical variables,
determined by the phase-space distribution corresponding to a quantum
wavefunction. We show, however, that this particular guidance term can be
recovered as the mean-field limit of averaged pairwise interactions among an
ensemble of finitely many particles.

Abstract: Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless
of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research,
existing verification techniques are insufficient--even for quantum circuits, a
deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins
many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require
exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of)
assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with
many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called
SAQR-QC. The logic supports Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning
about Quantum Circuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i)
some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism
to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps
remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, all
reasoning steps are local--i.e., they each involve just a small number of
qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the
verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of
quantum phase estimation--a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.

Conclusion: 该工作为量子计算机模拟深度热化提供了可扩展方案，并推动了对BQP观察者之外的计算量子伪随机性的研究。

Abstract: Deep thermalization refers to the emergence of Haar-like randomness from
quantum systems upon partial measurements. As a generalization of quantum
thermalization, it is often associated with high complexity and entanglement.
Here, we introduce computational deep thermalization and construct the fastest
possible dynamics exhibiting it at infinite effective temperature. Our circuit
dynamics produce quantum states with low entanglement in polylogarithmic depth
that are indistinguishable from Haar random states to any computationally
bounded observer. Importantly, the observer is allowed to request many copies
of the same residual state obtained from partial projective measurements on the
state -- this condition is beyond the standard settings of quantum
pseudorandomness, but natural for deep thermalization. In cryptographic terms,
these states are pseudorandom, pseudoentangled, and crucially, retain these
properties under local measurements. Our results demonstrate a new form of
computational thermalization, where thermal-like behavior arises from
structured quantum states endowed with cryptographic properties, instead of
from highly unstructured ensembles. The low resource complexity of preparing
these states suggests scalable simulations of deep thermalization using quantum
computers. Our work also motivates the study of computational quantum
pseudorandomness beyond BQP observers.

Abstract: Entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science and
many-body physics, yet quantifying it in mixed quantum many-body systems has
remained a notoriously difficult problem. Here, we introduce families of
quantitative entanglement witnesses, constructed from partial transpose and
realignment moments, which provide rigorous bounds on entanglement monotones.
Our witnesses can be efficiently measured using SWAP tests or variants of Bell
measurements, thus making them directly implementable on current hardware.
Leveraging our witnesses, we present several novel results on entanglement
properties of mixed states, both in quantum information and many-body physics.
We develop efficient algorithms to test whether mixed states with bounded
entropy have low or high entanglement, which previously was only possible for
pure states. We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank
using only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using
four-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of
quantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has
been limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement
phase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose
negativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result
that also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently
computed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of
entanglement in extensive many-body systems. Finally, we make progress on the
entanglement required for quantum cryptography, establishing rigorous limits on
pseudoentanglement and pseudorandom density matrices with bounded entropy. Our
work opens new avenues for quantifying entanglement in large and noisy quantum
systems.

Abstract: We solve the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation in several scenarios using
the quantum annealer provided by the D-Wave systems within a pseudospectral
scheme, where its solution is encoded into certain set of suitable basis
functions. We assess the performance of different strategies of encoding based
on algebraic arguments and the adiabatic condition, and benchmark these against
the classical heuristic simulating annealing algorithm. In particular, we
compute the minimum energy gap, the so-called dynamic range and the mean
squared error to assess the numerical stability, consistency and accuracy of
the solutions returned by each strategy. Our work stresses out the importance
of developing custom embedded techniques ensuring well-conditioned algebraic
systems. In particular, we find out that encoding strategies retrieving
algebraic systems exhibiting full-rank and small dynamic ranges enhance the
performance of the quantum annealer even under polychromatic driving and for
intricate initial conditions. We further discuss the prospect of developing
hybrid quantum-classical schemes enable to meet suitable algebraic and
adiabatic conditions simultaneously.

Abstract: Collision models provide a simple and versatile setting to capture the
dynamics of open quantum systems. The standard approach to thermalisition in
this setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared
thermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\Delta t$ with
the system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits
are prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment
temperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the
same thermal steady state for both settings as $\Delta t\to 0$, although even
in this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with
the two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents.
Non-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either
setting are introduced. Here, the system in the single-bath setup again reaches
a steady state at the canonical temperature of the bath, but the nonequilibrium
steady state of the two-bath setup tends to a different temperature due to the
generation of strong system-environment and intra-environment correlations. The
two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which
are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case. We showcase this with a
trajectory analysis of the heat currents within a two-point measurement scheme.
Our results provide insights into the dynamics and thermodynamics of
thermalisation towards nonequilibrium steady states and the role of
non-Markovian interactions.

Abstract: Building on the recently developed quantum state texture resource theory, we
exhibit that the difference between maximum and minimum textures is a valid
purity monotone in any dimension and provide a lower bound for existing purity
measures. We introduce a texture-based resource monotone applicable across
general convex resource theories, encompassing quantum coherence,
non-stabilizerness, and entanglement. In particular, we propose the notion of
non-local texture, which corresponds to the geometric measure of bipartite and
multipartite entanglement in pure states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
texture of the entire ground state or its subsystems can effectively signal
quantum phase transitions in the Ising chain under both transverse and
longitudinal magnetic fields, offering a powerful tool for characterizing
quantum criticality.

Abstract: We consider distillation of ebits between a specified pair of subsystems from
pure tripartite states by local operations and classical communication. It is
known that, allowing an asymptotically vanishing error, the maximal rate is the
minimum of the von Neumann entropies of the two corresponding marginals, and
under asymptotic stochastic local operations and classical communication the
maximal rate is given by a minimization over a one-parameter family of
entanglement measures. In this paper, we determine the direct and strong
converse error exponents, and the optimal rate for deterministic
transformations.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of frustrated quantum phases in a
Jaynes-Cummings (JC) trimer with complex hopping amplitudes between the
cavities, which represents the smallest frustrated unit in light-matter
systems. The complex hopping amplitudes that can be engineered via synthetic
gauge fields introduce chiral effects and geometric frustration into the
system.We obtain analytic solutions in the semiclassical limit and map out the
phase diagram of this model, featuring one normal and three distinct
superradiant phases. Among these phases, a chirally frustrated superradiant
phase emerges, characterized by broken chiral and translational symmetries and
unidirectional photon flow. These results reveal how frustration and symmetry
breaking can arise in JC systems with synthetic gauge fields and ultrastrong
coupling.

Conclusion: 该协议为分布式环境中的安全、可扩展和匿名通信提供了重要进展。

Abstract: This article introduces the innovative Quantum Dining Information Brokers
Problem, presenting a novel entanglement-based quantum protocol to address it.
The scenario involves $n$ information brokers, all located in distinct
geographical regions, engaging in a metaphorical virtual dinner. The objective
is for each broker to share a unique piece of information with all others
simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, this protocol enables a fully
parallel, single-step communication exchange among all brokers, regardless of
their physical locations. A key feature of this protocol is its ability to
ensure both the anonymity and privacy of all participants are preserved,
meaning no broker can discern the identity of the sender behind any received
information. At its core, the Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem serves
as a conceptual framework for achieving anonymous, untraceable, and massively
parallel information exchange in a distributed system. The proposed protocol
introduces three significant advancements. First, while quantum protocols for
one-to-many simultaneous information transmission have been developed, this is,
to the best of our knowledge, one of the first quantum protocols to facilitate
many-to-many simultaneous information exchange. Second, it guarantees complete
anonymity and untraceability for all senders, a critical improvement over
sequential applications of one-to-many protocols, which fail to ensure such
robust anonymity. Third, leveraging quantum entanglement, the protocol operates
in a fully distributed manner, accommodating brokers in diverse spatial
locations. This approach marks a substantial advancement in secure, scalable,
and anonymous communication, with potential applications in distributed
environments where privacy and parallelism are paramount.

Abstract: We study the aspects of quantum chaos in mushroom billiards introduced by
Bunimovich. This family of billiards classically has the property of mixed
phase space with precisely one entirely regular and one fully chaotic (ergodic)
component, whose size depends on the width w of the stem, and has two limiting
geometries, namely the circle (as the integrable system) and stadium (as the
fully chaotic system). Therefore, this one-parameter system is ideal to study
the semiclassical behavior of the quantum counterpart. Here, in paper I, we
study the spectral statistics as a function of the geometry defined by w, and
as a function of the semiclassical parameter k, which in this case is just the
wavenumber k. We show that at sufficiently large k the level spacing
distribution is excellently described by the Berry-Robnik (BR) distribution
(without fitting). At lower k the small deviations from it can be well
described by the Berry-Robnik-Brody (BRB) distribution, which captures the
effects of weak dynamical localization of Poincar\'e-Husimi functions. We also
employ the analytical theory of the level spacing ratios distribution P(r) for
mixed-type systems, recently obtained by Yan (2025), which does not require a
spectral unfolding procedure, and show excellent agreement with numerics in the
semiclassical limit of large k. In paper II we shall analyze the eigenstates by
means of Poincar\'e-Husimi functions.

Abstract: In this work we explore the limitations and robustness of thermal radiation
in dynamical Casimir systems serving as analogs for Hawking radiation. Through
detailed numerical analysis, we characterize particle production spectra in
cavities with moving boundaries under various configurations, including
expanding, collapsing, and rigidly accelerating scenarios. We find that thermal
signatures emerge in specific expanding cavity configurations but are highly
dependent on frequency bands and acceleration parameters. In those
configurations of the cavity where there is thermal production, we derive
fitting expressions that quantify deviations from idealized thermal spectra
through gray-body factors, revealing oscillatory behaviors tied to acceleration
duration. Our results identify which experimental setups can reliably simulate
gravitationally-induced phenomena and quantify how finite-size effects and
transient dynamics modify the expected thermal distributions, providing a
comprehensive framework for distinguishing genuine Hawking-like radiation from
experimental artifacts.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum critical states towards the thermodynamic limit is
essential for understanding phases of matter. The power of quantum simulators
for preparing the critical states relies crucially on the structure of quantum
circuits and in return provides new insight into the critical states. Here, we
explore the critical states of the quantum Rabi model~(QRM) by preparing them
variationally with Hamiltonian variational ans\"atze~(HVA), in which the
intricated interplay among different quantum fluctuations can be parameterized
at different levels. We find that the required circuit depth scales linearly
with the effective system size, suggesting that HVA can efficiently capture the
behavior of critical states of QRM towards the thermodynamic limit. Moreover,
we reveal that HVA gradually squeeze the initial state to the target critical
state, with a number of blocks increasing only linearly with the effective
system size. Our work suggests variational quantum algorithm as a new probe for
the complicated critical states.

Abstract: Optical quantum memories are essential components for realizing the full
potential of quantum networks. Among these, rare-earth-doped crystal memories
stand out due to their large multimode storage capabilities. To maximize the
multimode capacity in the time domain, it is key to simultaneously achieve
large memory bandwidth and long optical storage time. Here, we demonstrate an
atomic frequency comb optical memory in Yb:YSO, with a memory bandwidth of
250~MHz and a storage time of up to 125 $\mu$s. The efficiency reaches 20 \% at
short storage times, and 5 \% at 125 $\mu$s. These results were enabled by an
optimized optical pumping scheme, guided by numerical modelling. Our approach
is specifically designed for future spin-wave storage experiments, with the
theoretical bandwidth limit set at 288 MHz by the hyperfine structure of
Yb:YSO. Additionally, we introduce an efficient method for synthesizing the
optical pumping waveforms required for generating combs with tens of thousands
of teeth, as well as a simple yet frequency-agile laser setup for optical
pumping across a 10 GHz bandwidth.

Abstract: We address the problem of optimal pumping strategies in quantum networks.
These networks enable secure communication by distributing entangled photon
pairs to user (or node) pairs. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, like
BBM92, generate secret keys from entangled photons. While secure communication
and error correction are essential for any quantum communication channel,
resource contention, optimization, and fairness issues are critical for
networks. In this article, we analyze the performance of quantum networks,
proposing simple distributed algorithms for QKD networks generating secret
keys.
  There are significant advantages of pumping entangled photons in QKD
networks, but challenges arise in practical implementations. The underlying
channels are inherently time-varying, and thus data rates fluctuate between
nodes. Moreover, multiple edges (node pairs) can be pumped simultaneously,
albeit at the cost of a reduced secret key rate (SKR). These temporal and
spatial constraints yield a complex decision-making problem whose solutions may
favor a small set of user pairs to the detriment of overall, long-run network
performance.
  We design adaptive pumping strategies that address these challenges in QKD
networks. In particular, we find that a proportional fairness pumping strategy
(PF-PS) stands out by dynamically prioritizing users with lower average secret
key rates and optimally balancing fairness with throughput. The proposed
algorithm is a natural extension to quantum networks of the Proportional Fair
Scheduler deployed in 4G LTE and 5G mobile networks. Both theoretical analysis
and numerical simulations confirm that PF-PS is optimal for entangled state
distribution, and thus, when adapted appropriately, proportional fair pumping
is a strong candidate for efficient resource allocation in quantum networks.

Result: 推导出了在NHQS中满足EOC且与厄米系统中电流行为相似的电流定义。

Conclusion: 为NHQS中的电流定义提供了理论基础，有助于进一步研究非厄米系统的物理特性。

Abstract: In recent years, non-Hermitian quantum systems (NHQS) have been actively
studied. In conventional quantum mechanics, Hermitisity is a fundamental
property of Hamiltonians. However, it is known that when a system interacts
with its environment, its time evolution can be effectively described by
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. NHQS are attracting attention because novel
physical phenomena not observed in Hermitian systems are predicted due to its
non-Hermitisity. In this study, I investigated the definition of current in
NHQS. In Hermitian systems, equation of continuity(EOC) holds between the
particle density and the current. However, in NHQS, there are cases where the
conventional definition of current does not satisfy EOC. Therefore, I
considered the definition of current that satisfies EOC in NHQS. As a result, I
derived current that satisfies EOC and behaves similarly to the current in
Hermitian systems with respect to physical quantities (electromagnetic fields).

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely recognized as highly
promising solid-state quantum sensors due to their long room temperature
coherence times and atomic-scale size, which enable exceptional sensitivity and
nanoscale spatial resolution under ambient conditions. Ultrafast laser writing
has demonstrated the deterministic spatial control of individual NV$^-$
centers, however, the resulting random orientation of the defect axis limits
the magnetic field sensitivity and signal contrast. Here, we present an
all-optical approach for reorienting laser-written NV$^-$ centers to lie along
a specific crystallographic axis using femtosecond laser annealing. This
technique enables the creation of spatially ordered NV$^-$ arrays with uniform
orientation, for enhancing performance for quantum magnetometry. We achieve
deterministic alignment along the optical axis in both (100)- and
(111)-oriented diamond substrates, paving the way for scalable,
high-performance quantum devices based on orientation-controlled NV$^-$
centers.

Conclusion: 源场理论在不使用RWA和WWA时仍能保持物理一致性，而微扰理论在特定条件下失效。

Abstract: Spontaneous emission in dipole approximation is studied theoretically using
both source-field theory and a Schrodinger picture approach. Using source-field
theory we obtain formal equations for the Poynting vector and energy density
without making the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and Weisskopf-Wigner
approximation (WWA). The initial condition at t=0 is one in which the atom is
in an excited state and the field in the vacuum state. The source-field
expressions are evaluated within the the RWA and WWA and are found to satisfy
Poynting's theorem. To explore the consequences of not making the RWA and WWA,
the Poynting vector and energy density are calculated using perturbation
theory. We use a Schrodinger picture approach and essentially reproduce and
complement the results of Compagno, Passante, and Persico [J. Mod. Optics 37:8,
1377 (2007)] and those of Power and Thirunamachandran [Phys. Rev. A 45, 54
(1992)] obtained using a Heisenberg picture approach. The theory involves a sum
over field mode frequencies and both finite cutoffs and convergence factors are
used to carry out the sums. It is shown that the perturbation theory
calculation leads to unphysical values for atomic state populations for all
times when a sum over all field frequencies is taken, even if a convergence
factor is used. It is also proved that the fields calculated using source-field
theory always satisfy Poynting's theorem for ct not equal to R, where R is the
distance from the atom.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉大型开放系统中的复杂量子动力学，展示了其在量子模拟中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a scalable variational method for simulating the dynamics of
interacting open quantum bosonic systems deep in the quantum regime. The method
is based on a multi-dimensional Wigner phase-space representation and employs a
Variational Multi-Gaussian (VMG) ansatz, whose accuracy is systematically
controlled by the number of Gaussian components. The variational equations of
motion are derived from the Dirac-Frenkel principle and evaluated efficiently
by combining the analytical structure of Gaussian functions with automatic
differentiation. As a key application, we study a driven-dissipative
two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard lattice with two-boson coherent driving and
two-body losses. Using our dynamical approach, we compute the finite-size
scaling of the Liouvillian spectral gap - extracted from the relaxation
dynamics - which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal
critical slowing down with dynamical exponents of the 2D quantum Ising
universality class, demonstrating the power of our method to capture complex

Abstract: We apply a graybox machine-learning framework to model and control a qubit
undergoing Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics from environmental noise. The
approach combines physics-informed equations with a lightweight transformer
neural network based on the self-attention mechanism. The model is trained on
simulated data and learns an effective operator that predicts observables
accurately, even in the presence of memory effects. We benchmark both
non-Gaussian random-telegraph noise and Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise and
achieve low prediction errors even in challenging noise coupling regimes. Using
the model as a dynamics emulator, we perform gradient-based optimal control to
identify pulse sequences implementing a universal set of single-qubit gates,
achieving fidelities above 99% for the lowest considered value of the coupling
and remaining above 90% for the highest.

Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently
follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research
community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage
currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to
train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea
of No\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating
parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper
presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to
train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the
latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the
MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world
applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our
approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of
similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller
numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique
leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM
executions.

Motivation: 二阶锥规划（SOCP）是半定规划（SDP）的特例，但现有方法未充分利用其结构。论文旨在通过SOCP特定算法提升效率。

Method: 采用乘法权重更新方法，针对SOCP的结构优化算法，提出经典和量子两种实现。

Result: 量子算法复杂度接近线性规划（LP），优于现有SDP方法；经典算法在样本查询模型中表现良好。

Conclusion: SOCP特定算法能显著提升效率，尤其是量子算法在特定条件下优于经典方法。

Abstract: We give classical and quantum algorithms for approximately solving
second-order cone programs (SOCPs) based on the multiplicative weights (MW)
update method. Our approach follows the MW framework previously applied to
semidefinite programs (SDPs), of which SOCP is a special case. We show that the
additional structure of SOCPs can be exploited to give better runtime with
SOCP-specific algorithms. For an SOCP with $m$ linear constraints over $n$
variables partitioned into $r \leq n$ second-order cones, our quantum algorithm
requires $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{r}\gamma^5 + \sqrt{m}\gamma^4)$ (coherent)
queries to the underlying data defining the instance, where $\gamma$ is a
scale-invariant parameter proportional to the inverse precision. This nearly
matches the complexity of solving linear programs (LPs), which are a less
expressive subset of SOCP. It also outperforms (especially if $n \gg r$) the
naive approach that applies existing SDP algorithms onto SOCPs, which has
complexity $\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{4}(n + \gamma \sqrt{n} + \sqrt{m}))$. Our
classical algorithm for SOCP has complexity $\widetilde{O}(n\gamma^4 + m
\gamma^6)$ in the sample-and-query model.

Abstract: We motivate the use of a ladder of Rydberg atoms as an analog simulator for a
lattice gauge theory version of scalar electrodynamics also called the compact
Abelian Higgs model. We demonstrate that by using a few thousand shots from a
single copy of the ladder simulator it is possible to estimate the bipartite
quantum von Neumann entanglement entropy $S^{vN}_A$. The estimation relies on
an optimized filtration of the mutual information associated with the
bitstrings obtained from public facilities of configurable Rydberg arrays named
Aquila. We discuss the limitations associated with finite sampling, sorting
fidelity, adiabatic preparation, ramp-down of the Rabi frequency before
measurement, and readout errors. We use cumulative probability distribution to
compare Aquila results with high accuracy density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) or exact results. The state preparation appears to be the main source of
error. We discuss the large volume behavior of the cumulative probability
distribution and show examples where for a finite number of shots, there
appears to be some large enough size for which any given state is seen at most
once with high probability. We show that the results presented can be extended
to multipartite entanglement. We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations
for large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the
near future.

Result: 三种方法在理想QRF下等价，且QRF变换在半经典极限下一致。

Conclusion: 研究为扩展非理想QRF方法提供了基础，并揭示了不确定性在框架间的依赖性。

Abstract: The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a
universal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to
new revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics.
Multiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way
symmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we
investigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries,
namely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN)
approaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the
effective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by
expectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic
approach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical
algebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all
three formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that
these three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished
by sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two
approaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including
relativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF
transformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the
older effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application,
we explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out
to be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and
algebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally,
we pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by
studying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters
formalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了AQS方法至有限温度，通过将原子描述为相空间中的温度依赖高斯包（GPPs），研究了温度对非晶二维硅玻璃在准静态拉伸加载下非弹性及断裂起始的影响。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AQS方法在零温附近有效，但有限温度下的应用受限。本文旨在扩展AQS方法，以研究温度对无序材料力学行为的影响。

Method: 采用温度依赖的高斯包（GPPs）描述原子，结合Metropolis采样，预测温度对材料断裂起始的影响，并通过低应变率MD模拟验证。

Result: 该方法能准确预测原子尺度重排区域及材料热膨胀，并高效预测无序固体中的局部重排区域。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究有限温度下无序材料的非线性力学行为提供了高效且准确的技术，无需昂贵的MD模拟。

Abstract: The athermal quasistatic (AQS) method is a powerful technique to study the
mechanical behavior of disordered systems. However, its applicability is
limited to temperatures near zero, where thermal activation is unlikely. In
this work, we extend the AQS method to finite temperatures, based on a
formulation that describes atoms as temperature-dependent Gaussian packets
(GPPs) in phase space under quasistatic conditions, thus equivalent to minimum
free energy conditions. This framework is used to study the effect of
temperature on the onset of inelasticity and fracture in amorphous
two-dimensional silica glass approaching quasistatic conditions under uniaxial
tensile loading. An important characteristic of this formulation is the
directional dependence of the variance of each Gaussian packet in configuration
space, making this formulation an inexpensive and accurate predictor of zones
prone to atomic-scale rearrangements, both in the undeformed state and (with
increasing accuracy) as the deformation progresses. This method is also shown
to accurately capture the thermal expansion of the disordered material.
Furthermore, combining the GPP description with Metropolis sampling predicts
the effect of temperature on the onset of fracture of the material, which is
validated through MD simulations at strain rates as low as $10^{4}$s$^{-1}$.
The presented framework therefore provides a valuable technique for studying
the nonlinear mechanics of disordered materials at finite temperature and for
predicting local rearrangement zones in disordered solids efficiently without
the need for expensive MD simulations.

Motivation: 探索非线性管理在两组分BEC中对混合-非混合转变的影响，特别是在临界点附近的行为，以及线性混合的作用。

Method: 使用变分近似和数值解分析静态域壁结构，研究线性混合和非线性管理对系统的影响，并通过数值模拟识别激发频率。

Result: 发现RC提高了MIM转变的临界强度，NM通过周期性变化限制混合性，且在特定条件下域壁结构稳定。

Conclusion: 非线性管理和线性混合对两组分BEC的混合-非混合转变有显著影响，为相关系统的控制提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We investigate application of the nonlinearity management (NM, i.e., periodic
variation of the strength of the inter-component repulsion) to the
miscibility-immiscibility (MIM) transition across the critical point of a
two-component BEC, both with and without the linear mixing (Rabi coupling, RC)
between the components. To this end, we first identify, by means of a
variational approximation and numerical solution, diverse stationary
domain-wall (DW) structures supported by the system in the absence of the
management. The approximate analytical solutions for the DWs are found to be in
excellent agreement with their numerical counterparts. An analytical estimate
is also produced for the upshift of the MIM transition caused by the pressure
of the trapping potential in the case of a confined system. An exact DW
solution is produced for the system including the P\"{o}schl-Teller potential,
which is stable (unstable) if the potential is repulsive (attractive). Further,
we find the spectrum of linear excitations in the spatially uniform mixed
state, and thus establish parameter regions where the system is stable/unstable
against demixing. In particular, RC upshifts the critical strength of the
inter-component repulsion for the onset of the MIM transition. Eigenfrequencies
of excitations on top of DW states are identified from numerical simulations
through monitoring the evolution of perturbed states. Weak NM applied at the DW
eigenfrequency reveals features of the nonlinear resonance. Stronger NM, under
which the system periodically crosses the MIM-transition point, restricts the
miscibility.

Conclusion: 信息是提升热机性能的关键因素，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Information can improve heat engine performance, but the underlying
principles are still not so clear. Here we introduce a Carnot information
machine (CIE) and obtain a quantitative relationship between the engine
performance and information. We demonstrate that the presence of information
changes allows the CIE to operate as a heat engine in the regime where the
standard Carnot cycle is prohibited, ensures that the efficiency of the CIE is
greater than or equal to the standard Carnot efficiency, and significantly
enables it to achieve 100\% efficiency with positive work extraction for
arbitrary two-level systems. We explicitly demonstrate these features using a
spin-1/2 system and propose an experimental implementation scheme based on a
trapped $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ion.

Motivation: 传统的单自旋Glauber动力学在采样Ising和Potts模型时效率较低，需要更高效的算法来采样Potts晶格规范理论。

Method: 通过二维细胞表示（普拉奎特随机簇模型）推广Swendsen-Wang和侵入簇算法，侵入簇算法利用同调渗流的停止条件在临界点采样。

Result: 在4维立方环面上的Z2和Z3晶格规范理论模拟中，新算法表现出比单自旋动力学更快的自相关衰减，并能高效采样线性尺度至少40的环面。

Conclusion: 推广的蒙特卡洛算法显著提高了采样效率，适用于高维Potts晶格规范理论的模拟。

Abstract: Monte Carlo algorithms, like the Swendsen-Wang and invaded-cluster, sample
the Ising and Potts models asymptotically faster than single-spin Glauber
dynamics do. Here, we generalize both algorithms to sample Potts lattice gauge
theory by way of a $2$-dimensional cellular representation called the plaquette
random-cluster model. The invaded-cluster algorithm targets Potts lattice gauge
theory at criticality by implementing a stopping condition defined in terms of
homological percolation, the emergence of spanning surfaces on the torus.
Simulations for $\mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_3$ lattice gauge theories on the
cubical $4$-dimensional torus indicate that both generalized algorithms exhibit
much faster autocorrelation decay than single-spin dynamics and allow for
efficient sampling on $4$-dimensional tori of linear scale at least $40$.

Conclusion: 通过非厄米哈密顿量的方法，成功分析了Lindblad非平衡动力学中的线性响应函数。

Abstract: We consider a class of spinless-fermion Lindblad equations that exhibit
decoupled BBGKY hierarchies. In the cases where particle number is conserved,
their late time behaviour is characterized by diffusive dynamics, leading to an
infinite temperature steady state. Some of these models are Yang-Baxter
integrable, others are not. The simple structure of the BBGKY hierarchy makes
it possible to map the dynamics of Heisenberg-picture operators on few-body
imaginary-time Schr\"odinger equations with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We use
this formulation to obtain exact hydrodynamic projections of operators
quadratic in fermions, and to determine linear response functions in
Lindbladian non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: The dynamics of local observables in a quantum many-body system can be
formally described in the language of open systems. The problem is that the
bath representing the complement of the local subsystem generally does not
allow the common simplifications often crucial for such a framework. Leveraging
tensor network calculations and optimization tools from machine learning, we
extract and characterize the dynamical maps for single- and two-site subsystems
embedded in an infinite quantum Ising chain after a global quench. We consider
three paradigmatic regimes: integrable critical, integrable non-critical, and
chaotic. For each we find the optimal time-local representation of the
subsystem dynamics at different times. We explore the properties of the learned
time-dependent Liouvillians and whether they can be used to forecast the
long-time dynamics of local observables beyond the times accessible through
direct quantum many-body numerical simulation. Our procedure naturally suggests
a novel measure of non-Markovianity based on the distance between the
quasi-exact dynamical map and the closest CP-divisible form and reveals that
criticality leads to the closest Markovian representation at large times.

Abstract: Intertwined charge and spin correlations are ubiquitous in a wide range of
transition metal oxides and are often perceived as intimately related to
unconventional superconductivity. Theoretically envisioned as driven by strong
electronic correlations, the intertwined order is usually found to be strongly
coupled to the lattice as signaled by pronounced phonon softening. Recently,
both charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) and superconductivity have been
discovered in several Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates, in particular trilayer
nickelates RE4Ni3O10 (RE=Pr, La). The nature of the intertwined order and the
role of lattice-charge coupling are at the heart of the debate about these
materials. Using inelastic X-ray scattering, we mapped the phonon dispersions
in RE4Ni3O10 and found no evidence of phonon softening near the CDW wavevector
over a wide temperature range. Calculations of the electronic susceptibility
revealed a peak at the observed SDW ordering vector but not at the CDW
wavevector. The absence of phonon softening is in sharp contrast to that in
canonical oxide materials, notably cuprates. Our experimental and theoretical
findings highlight the crucial role of the spin degree of freedom and establish
a foundation for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and
density-wave transitions in RP nickelate superconductors and beyond.

Abstract: Topological electronic states such as topological insulators and quantum Hall
states typically require strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic fields. In this
study, we consider an electron system coupled to a spin system, where electrons
interact with magnons, quasiparticles of spin waves. We show that the
interaction between electrons and magnons transfers the effect of symmetry
breaking in the spin system to the electron system, whereby a non-trivial
topological phase can be induced in the electron system that is otherwise
topologically trivial. Through this ``topology transfer'' mechanism, we
demonstrate the realization of various topological phases, including quantum
Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, in simple ferromagnetic spin systems,
without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic field for electron
systems.

Abstract: We unveil an interesting example of topological flat bands of Majorana
fermions in quantum spin liquids. We study the Kitaev model on a periodically
depleted honeycomb lattice, under a magnetic field within the perturbation
theory. The model can be straightforwardly extended while maintaining the exact
solvability, and its ground state is a quantum spin liquid as on the honeycomb
lattice. As fractionalized excitations, there are unpaired localized Majorana
fermions in addition to the itinerant Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_2$
fluxes. We show that in the absence of the magnetic field the Majorana fermions
have completely flat bands at zero energy, and by applying the magnetic field,
they turn into topological flat bands with nonzero Chern number. By varying the
anisotropy of the interactions and the magnitude of the magnetic field, we
clarify that the system exhibits a variety of topological phases that do not
appear in the original model. We emphasize that the topological flat bands that
give this rich topology come from the hybridization of the Majorana flat bands
and unpaired Majorana fermions, which is unique to the flat bands of
fractionalized excitations in quantum spin liquids. Our findings would
stimulate the exploration of a new type of Kitaev materials exhibiting rich
topology from topological Majorana flat bands.

Abstract: Single crystals of quasi-2D chromium telluride system represented by Cr1+xTe2
(x = 0.22), which crystallizes in the trigonal structure with the c-axis as the
growth direction, are synthesized by the flux method. The magnetization
measurements revealed the coexistence and competition between ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic exchange interactions due to the presence of the intercalated
Cr-layers. A series of diverse magnetic transitions is exhibited by the
crystal. While cooling the crystal, it undergoes a paramagnetic to
antiferromagnetic transition at 190 K, followed by a transition into a
ferromagnetic state at around 160 K, and a spin-canting at a lower temperature
of 75 K. A possible lack of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure, along
with the observance of an unusual jump and loop opening in the isothermal
magnetization suggests that the crystals Cr1+xTe2 (x = 0.22) may host
skyrmions. Furthermore, concomitant to their magnetic transitions, anomalies
were observed in the derived Breit-Wigner-Fano fit parameters obtained from the
asymmetric temperature-dependent Raman spectra, evidencing a strong spin-phonon
coupling effect, intrinsic to the grown crystals. A strong perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy along with the robust spin-phonon coupling, makes the
system a promising candidate for prospective spintronics applications.

Abstract: Exact results in frustrated quantum many-body systems are rare, especially in
dimensions higher than one. The Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model stands out as a
rare example of a two-dimensional spin system with an exactly solvable dimer
singlet ground state. In this work, we introduce a three-dimensional analogue
of the SS lattice, constructed by deforming the pyrochlore lattice to preserve
the local SS geometry. Despite the dimensional increase and altered topology,
the ground-state phase diagrams of classical Ising and Heisenberg spins, remain
analytically tractable and closely follow their 2D counterparts, including the
existence of a 1/3 magnetization plateau and umbrella states. Most notably, for
quantum spins S = 1/2, the dimer singlet state survives as an exact ground
state over a finite region of the phase diagram. We argue, using exact
diagonalization, that the singlet phase is stabilized beyond its 2D
counterpart, suggesting enhanced robustness in three dimensions. These results
offer a rare, controlled platform to explore the impact of dimensionality on
quantum frustration, exact solvability, and potential spin liquid behavior in
3D, with relevance to emergent topological and magnetic phases.

Result: 发现激子绝缘体可以在广泛的掺杂范围内作为混合相的一部分存在，并在某些参数范围内激子金属是最低能均匀相。

Conclusion: 激子关联可以显著影响系统行为，尤其是在远离半填充的情况下。

Abstract: We consider an extended spinless Falicov--Kimball model at an arbitrary
doping level, focusing on the range of parameter values where a uniform
excitonic insulator is stabilised at half-filling. We compare the properties of
possible uniform phases and construct the Hartree--Fock phase diagrams, which
include sizeable phase separation regions. It is seen that the excitonic
insulator can appear as a component phase in a mixed-phase state in a broad
interval of doping levels. In addition, in a certain range of parameter values
the excitonic metal (doped excitonic insulator) is identified as the
lowest-energy uniform phase. We suggest that this phase, which is unstable with
respect to phase separation, may be stabilised when the phase separation is
suppressed by the long-range Coulomb interaction. Overall, we find that
excitonic correlations can affect the behaviour of the system relatively far
away from half-filling.

Conclusion: Hund金属是研究强关联交替磁性的理想平台，本研究推动了强关联交替磁性物理的探索。

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a newly discovered magnetic phase, has spurred growing
research activity. Studies from a perspective of dynamical electronic
correlation still remain scarce. Employing density functional theory plus
dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) that incorporates dynamical electronic
correlation, we demonstrate that CaCrO$_3$ is a strongly correlated
altermagnet. Our DFT+DMFT calculations successfully reproduce the correlated
metallic behavior of CaCrO$_3$ and quantitatively capture the incoherence state
observed experimentally. We also identify that the altermagnetic CaCrO$_3$ is a
Hund's metal with a non-Fermi liquid behavior. Moreover, we find that
altermagnetism can induce flat bands, and these incipient flat bands are
further promoted by the strong renormalization from Hundness, which drives a
heavy-fermion behavior. Hence, we propose that Hund's metals provide an ideal
platform for hosting novel strongly correlated altermagnetism. Our work will
promote the study of strongly correlated altermagnetism physics.

Conclusion: 论文总结了Hofstadter蝴蝶分形在理论和实验物理中的深远意义，强调了其在现代物理学中的核心地位。

Abstract: Celebrating its golden jubilee, the Hofstadter butterfly fractal emerges as a
remarkable fusion of art and science. This iconic X shaped fractal captivates
physicists, mathematicians, and enthusiasts alike by elegantly illustrating the
energy spectrum of electrons within a two dimensional crystal lattice
influenced by a magnetic field. Enriched with integers of topological origin
that serve as quanta of Hall conductivity, this quantum fractal and its
variations have become paradigm models for topological insulators, novel states
of matter in 21st century physics. This paper delves into the theoretical
framework underlying butterfly fractality through the lenses of geometry and
number theory. Within this poetic mathematics, we witness a rare form of
quantum magic: Natures use of abstract fractals in crafting the butterfly graph
itself. In its simplest form, the butterfly graph tessellates a two dimensional
plane with trapezoids and triangles, where the quanta of Hall conductivity are
embedded in the integer sloped diagonals of the trapezoids. The theoretical
framework is succinctly expressed through unimodular matrices with integer
coefficients, bringing to life abstract constructs such as the Farey tree, the
Apollonian gaskets, and the Pythagorean triplet tree.

Abstract: Individual magnetic molecules are promising building blocks for quantum
technologies because of their chemical tunability, nanoscale dimensions, and
ability to self-assemble into ordered arrays. However, harnessing their
properties in quantum information processing requires precise local control of
their spin properties. In this work, we present spin-electric coupling (SEC)
for two molecular spin systems, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) and Fe-FePc
complexes, adsorbed on a surface. We use electron spin resonance combined with
scanning tunnelling microscopy (ESR-STM) to locally address them with the STM
tip and electrically tune them using the applied bias voltage. These
measurements reveal a pronounced nonlinear voltage dependence of the resonance
frequency, linked to the energic onset of other molecular orbitals. We
attribute this effect to a transport-mediated exchange field from the magnetic
tip, providing a large, highly localized, and broadly applicable SEC mechanism.
Finally, we demonstrate that the SEC enables all-electrical coherent spin
control: In Rabi oscillation measurements of both single and coupled Fe-FePc
complexes we show that the spin dynamics can be tuned, demonstrating a pathway
towards electrically controlled quantum operation.

Abstract: Molecular magnets are attractive as spin qubits due to their chemical
tunability, addressability through electron-spin resonance techniques, and long
coherence times. Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the
effect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to
enhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that
are not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn,
a spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at
temperatures $\le$2 K, $T_2\sim1$ $\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse
sequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM)
oscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as
high as $1.35$ $\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence
preservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields
$T_2\sim\!2.8$ $\mu$s at the CT and up to $\sim\!3.6$ $\mu$s in the ESEEM
regime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental
values of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the
molecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much
of the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules
themselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not
only field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency
itself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a
combination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise
in the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$. Such information about the
microscopic origins of decoherence can aid the rational design of
molecular-based spin qubits.

Abstract: In gate-defined semiconductor spin qubits, the highly tunable Heisenberg
exchange interaction is leveraged to implement fermionic two-qubit gates such
as CZ and SWAP. However, the broader family of fermionic simulation (fSim)
gates remains unexplored, and has the potential to enhance the performance of
near-term quantum simulation algorithms. Here, we demonstrate a method to
implement the fSim gate set in spin qubits using a single pulse combining
baseband and resonant exchange drives. This approach minimizes gate duration
and drive amplitude, mitigating decoherence and crosstalk. We validate its
effectiveness by realizing a resonant iSWAP gate between two hole spins in
germanium, achieving a fidelity of 93.8(5)% extracted with interleaved
randomized benchmarking. Quantum process tomography confirms accurate gate
calibration and identifies qubit decoherence as the dominant error source. Our
results establish a practical route toward a versatile and efficient two-qubit
gate set for spin-based quantum processors.

Conclusion: 需在半经典理论中引入新微观机制以准确描述圆偏振光电流效应。

Abstract: We apply the semiclassical theory including the Berry curvature dipole, side
jumps and skew scattering for a quantitative description of the circular
photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals at intraband absorption. In
contrast to gapped systems where they completely exhaust all contributions to
the CPGE current, all previously known semiclassical mechanisms give a result
different from that obtained using a complete quantum-mechanical approach. We
show that this difference in the existing quasiclassical and full
quantum-mechanical approaches persists at all spatial ranges of the disorder
potential. Apparently, the implementation of another microscopic mechanism into
the quasiclassical description of the CPGE is required.

Conclusion: 提出了不可压缩量子液体的相图，揭示了其与导电相的稳定性区域。

Abstract: We investigate resonant photoluminescence arising from incompressible quantum
liquids formed in two-dimensional electron systems. We demonstrate that, for
excitons composed of a photoexcited electron occupying the upper spin sublevel
of the zeroth Landau level and a valence-band hole, the influence of disorder
potential fluctuations on optical recombination is strongly suppressed,
indicating complete screening of the disorder. We identify an optical invariant
quantity that is insensitive to excitation energy yet strongly dependent on the
electron temperature, serving as a probe of exciton recombination in quantum
liquids. Analysis of this quantity reveals that quantum-liquid formation
initiates at (n = 1/3) as the electron temperature decreases, consistent with
the Laughlin state. Upon further cooling, the range of filling factors
exhibiting quantum-liquid behavior expands continuously from (n = 1/3) toward
(n = 1/2). Transitions between distinct incompressible quantum-liquid states
occur smoothly, without well-defined phase boundaries separating insulating and
conducting regimes. Locally, the system retains quantum-liquid characteristics
even as bulk transport measurements indicate finite conductivity. Finally, we
present a phase diagram delineating the stability region of incompressible
quantum liquids relative to conductive phases.

Abstract: Magnetite ($Fe_3O_4$) nanoparticles are crucial for biomedical applications,
including magnetic hyperthermia, targeted drug delivery, and MRI contrast
enhancement, due to their biocompatibility and unique physicochemical
properties. Here, we investigate how surface states influence their induction
performance. Heat treatment removes surface water and FeOOH, forming a
${\gamma}$-$Fe_2O_3$ shell, as confirmed by synchrotron powder diffraction,
neutron powder diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-of-flight inelastic
neutron spectroscopy. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that this
surface modification enhances magnetic anisotropy and reduces the spin
relaxation time, leading to a 140% increase in the specific absorption rate.
Additionally, the increased anisotropy suppresses the low-temperature clustered
spin-glass transition and raises the blocking temperature. These findings
highlight surface-state engineering as a powerful approach to optimizing
$Fe_3O_4$ nanoparticles for biomedical applications.

Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for
optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation
devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation
of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a
phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical
strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on
microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic
strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under
the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz).
Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as
straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally
align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations.
Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside
properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible
electronics, sensors, and energy devices.

Abstract: Geometry plays a fundamental role in a wide range of physical responses, from
anomalous transport coefficients to their related sum rules. Notable examples
include the quantization of the Hall conductivity and the Souza-Wilkens-Martin
(SWM) sum rule -- both valid at zero temperature, independent of interactions
and disorder. The finite-temperature generalization of the SWM sum rule has
been explored in the literature, revealing deep connections to the geometry of
density matrices. Building on recent advances in time-dependent geometric
frameworks, we propose a time-dependent quantum geometric tensor for thermal
density matrices. This formalism provides a unified interpretation of known sum
rules within the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, further
elucidating their fundamental geometric origin. In addition, it provides
experimentally accessible methods to probe quantum geometry beyond the
zero-temperature regime.

Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of interface states emerging at junctions
between armchair graphene nanoribbons of varying widths. By exploring diverse
width combinations and junction geometries, we demonstrate that predicting the
precise number of interface states requires considerations beyond the
topological classification alone; specifically, the width differences and
bonding configuration at the interface play crucial roles. For junctions
involving ribbons with small gaps, we further examine how an applied strain
affects their topological properties and, consequently, the interface states
formed. The spin states at these junctions are investigated using the
mean-field Hubbard model, revealing how the magnetic behavior at the interface
depends on the number of localized states present. These results are summarized
in a series of ``rules of thumb" to predict the number of localized states and
the magnetic moment at the junction. Our findings contribute to understanding
and engineering localized states in graphene-based devices, providing
guidelines for manipulating electronic and magnetic properties through
structural design.

Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of novel topological phases in quantum
Hall-superconductor hybrid systems driven by Landau level mixing and spin-orbit
interactions. Focusing on a narrow superconducting stripe atop a
two-dimensional electron gas, we identify regimes where the hybridization of
the chiral Andreev states at each side of the stripe leads to different phases
beyond the long sought $p$-wave superconducting one. These topological phases
exhibit distinctive transport signatures, including quantized nonlocal
conductance arising from electron cotunneling at filling factor $\nu=1$, which
can coexist with quantized crossed Andreev reflection at $\nu=2$. A combination
of numerical simulations and effective modelling reveals the role of spin-orbit
coupling and stripe geometry in controlling these transitions. Our findings
suggest new strategies for realizing and detecting topology in proximized
quantum Hall devices.

Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits are a promising platform for quantum computing but
remain vulnerable to charge noise. Accurate, in situ measurement of charge
noise could enable closed-loop control and improve qubit performance. Here, we
propose a method for real-time detection of charge noise using a silicon
singlet-triplet qubit with one electron initialized in an excited valley state.
This valley excitation acts as a spectator degree of freedom, coupled to a
high-quality resonator via the exchange interaction, which is sensitive to
charge-noise-induced voltage fluctuations. Dispersive readout of the resonator
enables a continuous, classical measurement of exchange fluctuations during
qubit operation. Signal-to-noise analysis shows that, under realistic device
parameters, sub-microsecond measurement times are possible using a
quantum-limited amplifier. Even without such an amplifier, sub-millisecond
performance is achievable with appropriately engineered resonator parameters.
This approach allows the probe to monitor slow drift in exchange in real time,
opening the door to feedback and feedforward strategies for maintaining
high-fidelity quantum operations. Importantly, the protocol preserves spin
coherence and can be run concurrently with qubit logic gates.

Abstract: Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose
an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder
interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry
schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped
topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-P\'erot
interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the
interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic
statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of
bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for
the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling
strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is
similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge
and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain
states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.
