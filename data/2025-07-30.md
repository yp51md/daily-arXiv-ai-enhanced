### [1] [Quantum Systems as Indivisible Stochastic Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21192)

Conclusion: 该研究为量子理论提供了更直观的理解方式，并可能带来新的应用方向。

Abstract: According to the stochastic-quantum correspondence, a quantum system can be
understood as a stochastic process unfolding in an old-fashioned configuration
space based on ordinary notions of probability and `indivisible' stochastic
laws, which are a non-Markovian generalization of the laws that describe a
textbook stochastic process. The Hilbert spaces of quantum theory and their
ingredients, including wave functions, can then be relegated to secondary roles
as convenient mathematical appurtenances. In addition to providing an arguably
more transparent way to understand and modify quantum theory, this
indivisible-stochastic formulation may lead to new possible applications of the
theory. This paper initiates a deeper investigation into the conceptual
foundations and structure of the stochastic-quantum correspondence, with a
particular focus on novel forms of gauge invariance, dynamical symmetries, and
Hilbert-space dilations.

### [2] [Benchmarking a Tunable Quantum Neural Network on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21222)
*Djamil Lakhdar-Hamina,Xingxin Liu,Richard Barney,Sarah H. Miller,Alaina M. Green,Norbert M. Linke,Victor Galitski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文实现了一种基于量子计算的神经网络，用于分类MNIST图像，展示了量子不确定性对性能的提升，并探讨了物理噪声对分类的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子神经网络在图像分类任务中的潜力，尤其是在当前量子设备上的实现和性能表现。

Method: 通过量子硬件实现神经网络的前馈过程，训练通过模拟完成，推理则在量子硬件上进行，引入插值参数控制量子效应。

Result: 适度增加量子不确定性可提升网络性能，物理噪声对分类结果有显著影响，尤其在边界案例中。

Conclusion: 量子神经网络在当前设备上具有潜力，未来扩展可能实现量子优势。

Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and
IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common
benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations
whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The
network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on
quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an
interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing
$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to
improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.
We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical
neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such
borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We
attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between
nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity
to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical
noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the
neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex
quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in
standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove
classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum
advantage.

### [3] [Vacuum-Induced Quantum Gate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21194)
*Arash Azizi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 利用加速观测者感知的量子真空实现量子Z门操作，通过双光子发射产生纠缠态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子真空在加速观测者视角下的潜在应用，将其转化为量子计算的资源。

Method: 使用两级Unruh-DeWitt探测器与真空进行二阶相互作用，产生双光子发射。

Result: 推导出探测器与场的最终纠缠态，证明其可作为量子Z门操作，并产生跨Rindler楔的纠缠光子对。

Conclusion: 将加速辐射重新定义为相干计算资源，为相对论量子信息提供新途径。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the quantum vacuum, as perceived by a uniformly
accelerating observer, can be harnessed to perform a quantum Z-gate. A
two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in a superposition of its ground and
excited states, undergoes a second-order interaction with the vacuum, resulting
in a two-photon emission. We derive the exact analytical form of the final
entangled detector-field state and show that this emission is conditional on a
phase flip of the detector's initial state-the defining feature of the gate's
operation. This process harvests entanglement from the Minkowski vacuum,
producing photon pairs entangled across causally disconnected Rindler wedges.
This work reframes acceleration-induced radiation not as thermal noise but as a
coherent computational resource, offering new pathways for relativistic quantum
information.

Result: 实现了质量超过170,000道尔顿的纳米粒子的量子干涉，宏观性指标μ=15.5，创下新纪录。

Conclusion: 实验为宏观量子现象提供了最强证据，并排除了某些宏观实在论对薛定谔方程的修正。

Abstract: The quantum superposition principle is a cornerstone of physics and at the
heart of many quantum technologies. Yet, it is still often regarded
counterintuitive because we do not observe its key features on the macroscopic
scales of our daily lives. It is therefore intriguing to ask how quantum
properties persist or change as we increase the size and complexity of objects.
A paradigmatic test for this question can be realized by matter-wave
interferometry, where the motion of individual massive particles becomes
delocalized and needs to be described by a wave function that spans regions far
larger than the particle itself. Here we present an experimental platform
extending matter-wave interference to a qualitatively new class of materials
that can vary widely in mass and size. We specifically demonstrate quantum
interference of sodium nanoparticles, which can each contain more than 7'000
atoms at masses greater than 170'000 dalton. They propagate in a Schr\"odinger
cat state with a macroscopicity of $\mu$ = 15.5, surpassing all previous
experiments by an order of magnitude and providing the most stringent exclusion
limit for generic macrorealistic modifications of the Schr\"odinger equation to
date.

Result: 发现有效耦合对量子比特位置和能量失谐高度敏感，并获得了超越微扰理论的解析解。

Conclusion: 为拓扑边缘模式介导的量子系统相互作用研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We investigate the coupling of two spatially separated qubits via
topologically protected edge states in a two-dimensional Hofstadter lattice. In
this hybrid platform, the qubits are coupled to distinct edge sites of the
lattice, enabling long-range interactions mediated by topological edge modes.
We solve the full system Hamiltonian and analyze the resulting eigenstate
structure to uncover the conditions under which coherent qubit interactions
emerge. Our analysis reveals that the effective coupling is highly sensitive to
the qubit placement, energy detuning, and the topological character of the edge
spectrum. We obtain an analytical solution that goes beyond the perturbative
regime, capturing the full interplay between the qubits and edge modes. These
results provide a foundation for exploring information transport and many-body
effects in engineered quantum systems where interactions are mediated by
topological edge modes.

### [6] [Emergence of Classicality in Wigner's Friend Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21221)
*Tom Rivlin,Sophie Engineer,Veronika Baumann*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了在退相干环境中，Wigner's Friend（WF）思想实验的量子达尔文主义（QD）框架下的表现，揭示了经典性的涌现及新型WF效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索WF思想实验中观察者与量子系统在退相干环境中的相互作用，以解决量子测量和客观性的问题。

Method: 采用量子达尔文主义框架，引入环境模型，通过数值模拟研究WF场景中经典性的涌现。

Result: 发现环境会掩盖传统WF效应，但也揭示了利用Friend与环境间相干性的新型WF效应。

Conclusion: 环境在WF场景中既限制传统效应，又催生新型效应，为量子测量和客观性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The Wigner's Friend (WF) thought experiment concerns quantum measurements by
a 'superobserver' of an observer measuring a quantum system. Variations on the
setup and its extended versions have seen a resurgence in recent years, in
light of a series of no-go theorems that reveal new quantum effects and
question the existence of absolute events. But most theoretical and
experimental studies of WF scenarios have restricted themselves to a 'friend'
composed of a single qubit with idealised measurement settings in an idealised
lab. In this work, we consider a specific, unitary model of the interaction
between the Friend and the system in the presence of a decohering environment.
In particular, we study WF scenarios from the perspective of quantum Darwinism
(QD). The QD framework is well-suited to studying the questions of observations
and agents in quantum theory that WF scenarios raise, as it is concerned with
how observers record objective information about a system with access only to
its surroundings. Here we describe how to add environments to simple and
extended WF scenarios in the QD framework, and present numerical results that
study the emergence of classicality, in the form of the Friend's measurement
result becoming more objective. In both the simple and extended cases, we also
find that the model and the environment obfuscate genuine WF effects and
introduce strong restrictions on them. However, we also find a novel form of WF
effect that exploits coherence between the Friend and the environment.

### [7] [Orthogonalization speed-up from quantum coherence after a sudden quench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21313)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了一种非平衡现象，类似于安德森正交性灾难（OC），发生在量子系统与局域缺陷相互作用猝灭后的瞬态动力学中。即使系统仅包含单个粒子，渐近态与初始叠加态的重叠也会以幂律方式消失，且指数依赖于相互作用强度。量子相干性在初始态中的存在体现在系统谱函数的无限不连续性以及猝灭变换的工作准概率分布中。工作分布的正性损失与量子力学要求的最小正交化时间减少直接相关。作者提出了一种基于冷原子系统拉姆齐干涉的实验验证方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子系统与局域缺陷相互作用猝灭后的瞬态动力学，探索安德森正交性灾难的非平衡表现及其与量子相干性的关系。

Method: 通过分析单粒子系统的渐近态与初始叠加态的重叠消失行为，研究相互作用强度对幂律指数的影响，并探讨量子相干性在谱函数和工作分布中的体现。

Result: 发现重叠消失遵循幂律行为，且指数依赖于相互作用强度；量子相干性导致谱函数的无限不连续性和工作分布的正性损失。

Conclusion: 量子相干性增强了正交化动力学，可通过冷原子系统的拉姆齐干涉实验验证这一现象。

Abstract: We introduce a nonequilibrium phenomenon reminiscent of Anderson's
orthogonality catastrophe (OC) that arises in the transient dynamics following
an interaction quench between a quantum system and a localized defect. Even if
the system comprises only a single particle, the overlap between the asymptotic
and initial superposition states vanishes with a power law scaling with the
number of energy eigenstates entering the initial state and with an exponent
that depends on the interaction strength. The presence of quantum coherence in
the initial state is reflected onto the discrete counterpart of an infinite
discontinuity in the system spectral function, a hallmark of Anderson's OC, as
well as in the quasiprobability distribution of work due to the quench
transformation. The positivity loss of the work distribution is directly linked
with a reduction of the minimal time imposed by quantum mechanics for the state
to orthogonalize. We propose an experimental test of coherence-enhanced
orthogonalization dynamics based on Ramsey interferometry of a trapped
cold-atom system.

### [8] [The Augmented Tree Tensor Network Cookbook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21236)
*Nora Reinić,Luka Pavešić,Daniel Jaschke,Simone Montangero*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: aTTN是一种通过添加解纠缠层的树张量网络，适用于模拟高维晶格系统，提供开源实现并验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维晶格系统中因晶格尺寸增大而增加的纠缠问题，提供比传统方法更高效的计算方案。

Method: 在树张量网络上添加解纠缠层，开发变分算法进行基态搜索，并测量可观测量。

Result: 在32×32自旋的方形晶格量子Ising模型和三角晶格Heisenberg模型中验证了aTTN的性能，发现其在某些参数下比矩阵乘积态和树张量网络更高效。

Conclusion: aTTN在高维晶格系统中表现出更高的计算效率和准确性，适用于复杂量子模拟任务。

Abstract: An augmented tree tensor network (aTTN) is a tensor network ansatz
constructed by applying a layer of unitary disentanglers to a tree tensor
network. The disentanglers absorb a part of the system's entanglement. This
makes aTTNs suitable for simulating higher-dimensional lattices, where the
entanglement increases with the lattice size even for states that obey the area
law. These lecture notes serve as a detailed guide for implementing the aTTN
algorithms. We present a variational algorithm for ground state search and
discuss the measurement of observables, and offer an open-source implementation
within the Quantum TEA library. We benchmark the performance of the ground
state search for different parameters and hyperparameters in the square lattice
quantum Ising model and the triangular lattice Heisenberg model for up to $32
\times 32$ spins. The benchmarks identify the regimes where the aTTNs offer
advantages in accuracy relative to computational cost compared to matrix
product states and tree tensor networks.

Conclusion: 纠缠与非定域性在连续变量双模高斯态中存在明确但非对称的关系。

Abstract: We investigate the connection between entanglement and non-locality between
continuous-variable bipartite Gaussian states. The investigation initiates with
formulating non-locality by using the phase-space Wigner representation of
Bell's function. Furthermore, our analysis shows entanglement to be necessary
for nonlocality, but not sufficient for it; however, nonlocality is sufficient
to ensure entanglement.

Conclusion: 结论是仅需邻接矩阵的结构即可实现量子态构造，为随机k-正则图的组合提供了独立的研究价值。

Abstract: Extending upon the observations of the emergence of quantum-like states from
classical complex synchronized networks, this work adds mathematical rigor to
the analysis of single Quantum-Like (QL) bits constructed by eigenvectors of
the adjacency matrices of such networks. First, we rigorously show that
symmetric construction of such networks (regular undirected/symmetric bipartite
graph $G_C$ connecting two regular undirected subgraphs $G_A,\,G_B$) leads to
an equal superposition of the $|+\rangle, |-\rangle$ Hadamard states (with
basis $|0\rangle,\,|1\rangle$ set from eigenvectors of the subgraphs), and
provide an analysis of sufficient conditions on the network for construction of
such states. Second, we prove two methods to construct any arbitrary single
qubit state $|\psi\rangle = a|0\rangle + b|1\rangle,\, |a|^2+|b|^2=1$ and
provide a switching lemma for the boundaries of both methods. The first method
of construction is by detuning the regularities of the two subgraphs and the
second is by asymmetrically constructing the bipartite connection matrix $C$ by
allowing it to be directed, and then detuning those regularities. While the
intuition is derived from the motivation of using complex synchronized networks
for quantum information storage and computations, the proofs for constructing
eigenvectors that interact in a quantum-like fashion only require the structure
of the graph embedded in the adjacency matrix. Practically, this means that
synchronization is not important to creating quantum-like bits, only that the
edge weights are generally unit or close to unit and that the subgraphs are
regular. As such, the results on combinations of random k-regular graphs
(precisely Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs) may be independently interesting.

### [11] [On Post-Quantum Cryptography Authentication for Quantum Key Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21325)
*Juan Antonio Vieira Giestinhas,Timothy Spiller*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合公钥基础设施（PKI）和后量子密码（PQC）的方法，以解决量子密钥分发（QKD）网络扩展性问题，替代传统的预共享密钥认证方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QKD网络依赖预共享密钥认证，随着网络规模扩大，所需密钥数量呈二次增长，导致扩展性不足。

Method: 采用PKI与PQC结合的方式，利用抗量子攻击的PQC算法实现远程认证，确保信息理论安全（ITS）密钥的分发。

Result: 该方法在有限敌手假设下，实现了认证、保密性和完整性，支持安全且可扩展的量子网络。

Conclusion: PKI与PQC的结合为大规模QKD网络提供了一种可行的扩展方案。

Abstract: The traditional way for a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) user to join a
quantum network is by authenticating themselves using pre-shared key material.
While this approach is sufficient for small-scale networks, it becomes
impractical as the network grows, due to the total quadratic increase in the
number of pre-shared keys required. To address this scalability issue, Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) combined with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) offers a
more scalable solution, allowing users to authenticate the QKD traffic remotely
to obtain information-theoretical secure (ITS) keys under the presented
assumptions. Unlike traditional PKI, which relies on classical cryptographic
algorithms such as RSA, the approach presented in this paper leverages PQC
algorithms that are believed to be resistant to quantum attacks. Similarly to
the SIGMA or TLS protocols, authentication, confidentiality, and integrity are
achievable against bounded adversaries to ensure secure and scalable quantum
networks.

Abstract: What is the fastest Artificial Intelligence Large Language Model (AI LLM) for
generating quantum operations? To answer this, we present the first
benchmarking study comparing popular and publicly available AI models tasked
with creating quantum gate designs. The Wolfram Mathematica framework was used
to interface with the 4 AI LLMs, including WolframLLM, OpenAI ChatGPT, Google
Gemini, and DeepSeek. This comparison evaluates both the time taken by each AI
LLM platform to generate quantum operations (including networking times), as
well as the execution time of these operations in Python, within Jupyter
Notebook. Our results show that overall, Gemini is the fastest AI LLM in
producing quantum gate designs. At the same time, the AI LLMs tested achieved
working quantum operations 80% of the time. These findings highlight a
promising horizon where publicly available Large Language Models can become
fast collaborators with quantum computers, enabling rapid quantum gate
synthesis and paving the way for greater interoperability between two
remarkable and cutting-edge technologies.

Conclusion: 量子方法在估计随机波动率扩散中具有潜在优势。

Abstract: Stochastic volatility models are the backbone of financial engineering. We
study both continuous time diffusions as well as discrete time models. We
propose two novel approaches to estimating stochastic volatility diffusions,
one using Quantum-Inspired Classical Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and the other
using Quantum Hidden Markov Models. In both cases we have approximate
likelihood functions and filtering algorithms that are easy to compute. We show
that the non-asymptotic bounds for the quantum HMM are tighter compared to
those with classical model estimates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子哈密顿量估计方法通常需要纠缠资源或动态控制，限制了实际应用。本文旨在开发一种更高效且资源需求更低的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需纠缠资源或动态控制，适用于实验场景，为量子技术提供了实用的哈密顿量估计工具。

Abstract: Accurate and resource-efficient estimation of quantum Hamiltonians is crucial
for developing practical quantum technologies, yet current methods typically
demand entanglement resources or dynamical control. Here, we demonstrate a
method that surpasses the standard quantum limit without requiring entanglement
resources, coherent measurements, or dynamical control. Our method relies on
trajectory-based Hamiltonian learning, in which we apply local, randomized
pre-processing to probe states and apply the maximum-likelihood estimation to
optimally scheduled Pauli measurements. Analytically, we establish the
emergence of a transient Heisenberg-limited regime for short-time probes for
our procedure. Furthermore, we outline how to estimate all Hamiltonian
parameters in parallel using ensembles of probe states, removing the need for
parameter isolation and structural priors. Finally, we supplement our findings
with a numerical study, learning multiple disordered, anisotropic Heisenberg
models for a 1D chain of spin-1/2 particles, featuring local transverse fields
with both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbour interactions, as well as a
gapless XXZ Hamiltonian. Our numerics show that our method needs only one shot
per Pauli measurement, making it well-suited for experimental scenarios. The
code for our method is available online and open-source.

### [15] [Towards self-correcting quantum codes for neutral atom arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21396)
*Jinkang Guo,Yifan Hong,Adam Kaufman,Andrew Lucas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: ZSZ codes, a non-abelian generalization of bivariate bicycle codes, show competitive performance in quantum error correction, with potential for scalable self-correcting quantum memories and implementation in neutral atom systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To discover low-overhead quantum error-correcting codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation, especially for hardware with long-range connectivity.

Method: Introduces ZSZ codes based on the group $\mathbb{Z}_\ell \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_m$, and evaluates their performance numerically under circuit-level depolarizing noise using belief-propagation and ordered-statistics decoders, as well as local self-correcting decoders.

Result: ZSZ codes achieve a threshold around 0.5% with belief-propagation decoders and a sustainable threshold around 0.095% with self-correcting decoders, outperforming bivariate bicycle codes and the 4D toric code.

Conclusion: ZSZ codes are promising for scalable self-correcting quantum memories and can be implemented using neutral atoms in movable tweezer arrays.

Abstract: Discovering low-overhead quantum error-correcting codes is of significant
interest for fault-tolerant quantum computation. For hardware capable of
long-range connectivity, the bivariate bicycle codes offer significant overhead
reduction compared to surface codes with similar performance. In this work, we
present "ZSZ codes", a simple non-abelian generalization of the bivariate
bicycle codes based on the group $\mathbb{Z}_\ell \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_m$. We
numerically demonstrate that certain instances of this code family achieve
competitive performance with the bivariate bicycle codes under circuit-level
depolarizing noise using a belief-propagation and ordered-statistics decoder,
with an observed threshold around $0.5\%$. We also benchmark the performance of
this code family under local "self-correcting" decoders, where we observe
significant improvements over the bivariate bicycle codes, including evidence
of a sustainable threshold around $0.095\%$, which is higher than the $0.06\%$
that we estimate for the four-dimensional toric code under the same noise
model. These results suggest that ZSZ codes are promising candidates for
scalable self-correcting quantum memories. Finally, we describe how ZSZ codes
can be realized with neutral atoms trapped in movable tweezer arrays, where a
complete round of syndrome extraction can be achieved using simple global
motions of the atomic arrays.

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的光子损失现象学方法在宽带光-物质相互作用下失效，需要一种更严格的量子主方程来描述开放腔-QED系统。

Method: 使用准正态模式（QNM）量化方法，推导出适用于任意色散和损耗的三维谐振器的量子主方程。

Conclusion: QNM主方程在极端耦合条件下具有广泛适用性，为实验观测宽带耗散效应提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Phenomenological approaches to photon loss have long been the workhorse of
cavity-QED, but prove inadequate in the presence of sufficiently broadband
light-matter interactions. We present a rigorous and \emph{ab initio}
derivation of a quantum master equation for a quantized optical cavity mode
coupled to a dipole, using a quasinormal mode (QNM) quantization procedure for
plasmonic and dielectric open-system cavity-QED, which is valid in broadband
light-matter interaction regimes, including ultrastrong coupling (USC). The
theory supports general three-dimensional resonators with arbitrary dispersion
and loss, and thus can be applied to a wide range of open cavities. Our
\emph{ab initio} and gauge-invariant approach fully recovers the recent result
of Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123601 (2025) for the spectral density of a quantized
cavity with a single dipole, exhibits a dissipative classical-quantum
correspondence for bosonic Hopfield model systems, and reveals important
departures from previous heuristic assumptions about system-bath coupling. We
identify a new criterion for what we term the ``broadband'' dissipative regime
of cavity-QED, where phenomenological models require corrections in accordance
with the intrinsic and spatially-dependent complex phase of the QNM, and also
shed light on \emph{fundamental limits} to single-mode models in extreme
coupling regimes. Using plasmonic and dielectric cavity examples, we show
validity ranges of our QNM master equation and spectral USC calculations, and
discuss prospects for near-term experimental observation of broadband
dissipative effects.

*Toyohiro Tsurumaru,Akihiro Mizutani,Toshihiko Sasaki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在量子密钥分发（QKD）协议中处理验证结果泄露给窃听者Eve的简单实用方法，通过增加隐私放大中减少的比特数来保证安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QKD协议的安全证明未明确考虑验证结果泄露给Eve的影响，可能导致安全性漏洞。

Method: 基于Renner的方法，利用剩余哈希引理，增加隐私放大中减少的比特数（仅需增加1比特）。

Result: 即使验证结果泄露给Eve，安全性仍可通过增加少量比特数得到保证。

Conclusion: 该方法为QKD协议的标准化和正式认证提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) is evaluated based on the
secrecy of Alice's key and the correctness of the keys held by Alice and Bob. A
practical method for ensuring correctness is known as error verification, in
which Alice and Bob reveal a portion of their reconciled keys and check whether
the revealed information matches. In this paper, we argue that when the
verification is executed in QKD protocols, it must be assumed that its outcome
is leaked to Eve. However, we observe that some existing security proofs for
QKD protocols that abort based on this outcome do not explicitly take into
account the information leakage associated with this outcome. To address this
problem, we present a simple and practical method that builds on Renner's
approach using the leftover hash lemma. Specifically, we show that even if
verification's outcome is leaked to Eve, the security can still be guaranteed
by increasing the number of bits reduced in privacy amplification by just one
bit. This result, presenting a method to incorporate a key step in practical
QKD protocols into security proofs, is expected to play an important role in
future standardization and formal certification of QKD protocols.

Conclusion: 该成果为卫星量子通信和空地基量子网络的实现提供了重要基础，同时展示了CVQKD系统的兼容性和跨领域应用潜力。

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) enables remote users to
share high-rate and unconditionally secure secret keys while maintaining
compatibility with classical optical communication networks and effective
resistance against background noise. However, CVQKD experiments have only been
demonstrated indoors or over short outdoor distances. Here, by developing
channel-fluctuation-independent high-precision manipulation of
continuous-variable quantum states, high-accuracy quantum signal acquisition
and processing, and high-efficiency free-space acquisition, tracking, and
pointing technology, we overcome the excess noise due to atmospheric effects
especially in daylight without extra wavelength conversion and spectral
filtering, and demonstrate for the first time long-distance free-space quantum
key distribution over 7-km inland and 9.6-km maritime atmospheric channels with
Gaussian-modulated coherent states. This achieved distribution distance of
secure quantum secret keys is well beyond the atmosphere's effective thickness,
offering a promising alternative for realizing satellite-based quantum
cryptography communication in daylight. Moreover, given that the CVQKD system
is naturally compatible with existing ground fiber telecommunication networks,
it marks an essential step for realizing integrated air-ground quantum access
networks with cross-domain applications.

Result: 随着耦合强度增加，SPSSV和TMSV态从量子非高斯性演化为经典单峰可分性，验证了量子-经典边界交叉点为量子计量中的最优阈值。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子传感和弱信号检测技术提供了可调平台，并验证了噪声抑制和信号增强的最优阈值。

Abstract: This study establishes a post-selected von Neumann framework to regulate
non-classical features of single-photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum (SPSSV) and
two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) states during weak-to-strong measurement
transitions. By synergizing Wigner-Yanase skew information, Amplitude Squared
(AS) squeezing, sum squeezing, and photon statistics, we demonstrate weak value
amplification as a unified control mechanism for quantum properties.
Phase-space analysis via the Husimi Kano Q function reveals a critical
transition: as coupling strength increases, SPSSV and TMSV states evolve from
quantum non-Gaussianity to classical single-peak separability, marking a
quantum-classical boundary crossing. This critical point is validated as the
optimal threshold for noise suppression and signal enhancement in quantum
metrology. The work provides a tunable platform for quantum sensing and
weak-signal detection technologies.

Abstract: We develop a quantum version of the em algorithm for training quantum

the well-known expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, offering a structured
alternative to gradient-based methods with potential advantages in stability
and convergence. We implement the algorithm on a semi-quantum restricted
Boltzmann machine, where quantum effects are confined to the hidden layer. This
structure enables analytical update rules while preserving quantum
expressivity. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets show that the
proposed method achieves stable learning and outperforms gradient-based
training in several cases. These results demonstrate the potential of
information-geometric optimization for quantum machine learning, particularly
in settings where standard methods struggle due to non-commutativity or
vanishing gradients.

Abstract: We develop foundations for a relational approach to quantum field theory
(RQFT) based on the operational quantum reference frames (QRFs) framework
considered in a relativistic setting. Unlike other efforts in combining QFT
with QRFs, we use the latter to provide novel mathematical and conceptual
foundations for the former. We focus on scalar fields in Minkowski spacetime
and discuss the emergence of relational local (bounded) observables and
(pointwise) fields from the consideration of Poincar\'e-covariant (quantum)
frame observables defined over the space of (classical) inertial reference
frames. We recover a relational notion of Poincar\'e covariance, with
transformations on the system directly linked to the state preparations of the
QRF. We introduce and analyse various causality conditions and how they can
arise as a consequence of the properties of the frame itself. The theory makes
direct contact with established foundational approaches to QFT: we demonstrate
that the vacuum expectation values derived within our framework reproduce many
of the essential properties of Wightman functions, carry out a detailed
comparison of the proposed formalism with Wightman QFT with the frame smearing
functions describing the QRF's localisation uncertainty playing the role of the
Wightmanian test functions, and show how the algebras generated by relational
local observables satisfy all of the core axioms of Algebraic QFT. We finish
with an extensive outlook describing a number of further research directions.
This work is an early step in revisiting the mathematical foundations of QFT
from a relational and operational perspective.

Abstract: Although many quantum channels satisfy Completely Positive Trace Preserving
(CPTP) condition, there are valid quantum channels that can be non-completely
positive (NCP). In a search of the conditions of noisy evolution to be a useful
resource for quantum computing, we study the relation of complete positivity
(CP) with unitality, where we find that a map must be non-unital in order to be
NCP, but not vice-versa. As memory effects can provide advantages in the
dynamics of noisy quantum systems, we investigate the relative CP condition and
the CP-divisibility condition of the system and environment subsystems of a
joint system-environment quantum state evolving noiselessly. We show that the
system and environment channels must be both CP (NCP) or CP-divisible
(CP-indivisible) for the evolution in the joint system-environment space to be
unitary. We illustrate our results with examples of Bell state created from
$|00\rangle$, GHZ state created from $|000\rangle$, W state created from
$|100\rangle$, and the partial transpose (PT) operation acting on the Bell
state.

Conclusion: 该模型为量子场论在弯曲曲面上的研究提供了新工具，并揭示了其与几何和物理现象的深刻联系。

Abstract: This is the Ph.D. thesis of the author. In this thesis, we construct the $
P(\phi)_2 $ Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model on curved surfaces and show that
it satisfies Segal's axioms (arXiv:2403.12804). An important ingredient in this
construction is the use of a local regularization procedure to define the
interaction as a random variable with respect to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF).
We provide a counterexample demonstrating that spectral truncation
regularization violates locality (arXiv:2312.15511). We then explain how
Segal's formalism can be extended to the gluing of surfaces with slits, which
offers a geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy. Using this
interpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field
Theory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity
corresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We
then show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This
allows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese
(arXiv:2501.19014). Finally, Segal's formalism is also related to the
asymptotics of zeta determinants on surfaces of large genus where the genus
tends to infinity (arXiv:2505.01586). We provide a geometric proof--independent
of Segal's axioms--of the corresponding result using heat kernels, in addition
to another proof based on Segal's axioms. Both proofs are presented in the
thesis.

Abstract: The creation of light-matter hybrid states, polaritons, in a cavity offers
new intriguing opportunities to manipulate the electronic structure and
electron dynamics of atoms and molecules. Here, we investigate the effect of
electronic strong coupling (ESC) between atoms or molecules and field modes of
a Fabry-P\'erot cavity on High-Harmonic Generation (HHG) spectra within a
theoretical model study. We assume that the atom or molecule is driven by an
intense classical laser field, giving rise to HHG, while being strongly coupled
to quantized cavity modes as described by the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in the
framework of molecular quantum electrodynamics (QED). Specifically, as a test
case, we first consider a model Hamiltonian of a one-dimensional hydrogen atom
coupled to a cavity mode, which can be treated ``numerically exact'' using grid
methods. Further, a hydrogen molecule coupled to a cavity mode is considered
and treated within a recently suggested QED-TD-CI (Quantum Electrodynamics
Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction) method [Weidman $\textit{et al.}$, J.
Chem. Phys. $\textbf{160}$, 094111 (2024)]. The resulting HHG spectra show (i)
a suppression of the harmonic cutoff in line with excitation of quantum light
in the cavity and, in some cases, (ii) enhancement of some harmonics of the
coupled light-matter system.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of a quantum-classical metaheuristic and

indicate that optimization methods are very susceptible to modeling techniques
and different solvers require dedicated methods. We show in this work that

mathematical optimization problems. Additionally, we present a detailed
performance comparison of the two solution methods for each optimization model.

Abstract: Quantum metrology concerns improving the estimation of an unknown parameter
using an optimal measurement scheme on the quantum system. More the optimality
of the measurement, the better will be the improvement in sensing the value of
the unknown parameter. Pertaining to the case of a two level system (qubit)
undergoing rotation, a typical metrological task concerns the estimation of the
angle of rotation ($\tau$) given the information about the axis of rotation
($\theta,\phi$). The method for garnering information about ($\tau)$ is through
maximizing the Fisher information. In the absence of the axis-knowledge, the
optimality of the metrological task reduces drastically. Drawing inspiration
from recent works leveraging entanglement to connect closed time-like curves
and metrology, we overcome this limitation (lack of the knowledge of the
rotation axis) using an ancilla assisted protocol. Here, the probe and the
ancilla interact through a coherently controlled superposition of unitary
evolutions. The quantum coherence in the initial state of the ancilla forms as
the resource aiding the protocol. By measuring the ancilla in the same coherent
basis in which it was prepared, we achieve optimal Fisher information about the
rotation angle, independent of the axis parameters. Notably, this
resource-efficient and operationally simple agnostic sensing alternative is
independent of both the entanglement in the initial joint state of the probe
and the ancilla and entangling measurements, yet accounts for maximum Fisher
information about the angle of rotation.

Abstract: Entanglement is a cornerstone in quantum information science, yet detecting
it efficiently remains a challenging task. Focusing on non-positive partially
transposed (NPT) states, we establish a hierarchy among entropy-based,
majorization, realignment, and reduction criteria for Haar uniformly generated
random states in finite dimensions, analyzing their performance based on rank
and subsystem dimension. We prove lower bounds on the rank of mixed quantum
states beyond which the realignment and entropic criteria fail to detect
entanglement. We evaluate the relative effectiveness of the considered
detection methods using three key indicators -- fraction of detected states,
mean detectable entanglement, and minimum required entanglement. Our results
provide insights into the entanglement thresholds needed for reliable
detection, showing that, beyond a certain level of entanglement, all criteria
become equally powerful for low-rank states, while hierarchy among various
criteria emerges with moderate to high ranks. Intriguingly, the proposed
ordering among the considered criteria in qubit-qudit systems is different from
that in higher dimensions. Additionally, we establish that the detection
efficiency is influenced by the asymmetry in the subsystem dimensions, by
illustrating how the realignment criterion behaves more efficiently than other
detection methods when the difference between the subsystem dimensions is
small.

Abstract: The present era of quantum processors with hundreds to thousands of noisy
qubits has sparked interest in understanding the computational power of these
devices and how to leverage it to solve practically relevant problems. For
applications that require estimating expectation values of observables the
community developed a good understanding of how to simulate them classically
and denoise them. Certain applications, like combinatorial optimization,
however demand more than expectation values: the bit-strings themselves encode
the candidate solutions. While recent impossibility and threshold results
indicate that noisy samples alone rarely beat classical heuristics, we still
lack classical methods to replicate those noisy samples beyond the setting of
random quantum circuits.
  Focusing on problems whose objective depends only on two-body correlations
such as Max-Cut, we show that Gaussian randomized rounding in the spirit of
Goemans-Williamson applied to the circuit's two-qubit marginals-produces a
distribution whose expected cost is provably close to that of the noisy quantum
device. For instance, for Max-Cut problems we show that for any depth-D circuit
affected by local depolarizing noise p, our sampler achieves an approximation
ratio $1-O[(1-p)^D]$, giving ways to efficiently sample from a distribution
that behaves similarly to the noisy circuit for the problem at hand. Beyond
theory we run large-scale simulations and experiments on IBMQ hardware,
confirming that the rounded samples faithfully reproduce the full energy
distribution, and we show similar behaviour under other various noise models.
  Our results supply a simple classical surrogate for sampling noisy
optimization circuits, clarify the realistic power of near-term hardware for
combinatorial tasks, and provide a quantitative benchmark for future
error-mitigated or fault-tolerant demonstrations of quantum advantage.

Conclusion: QKM为量子加速模拟非线性现象提供了实用框架，结合深度学习和量子算法的优势。

Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating
certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is
inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the
quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap
through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in
higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to
achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a
hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized
embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase
components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators
that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from
diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed
for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables
direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity
scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is
validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative
errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key
statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for
quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework
built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum

Result: 模型可实现经典或量子记忆，具体取决于初始条件和非经典关联的传播，并探索了量子记忆在多种实际场景中的出现。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了开放量子系统中记忆的起源，有助于设计近期的量子技术应用。

Abstract: Quantum systems are often hindered by decoherence due to impact from the
environment. While memoryless Markovian collision models are commonly used to
approximate such evolution, non-Markovian dynamics (with memory) is typical in
practice, with memory effects being harnessed as a resource for many tasks like
quantum error correction and information processing. Yet, the type of memory,
classical or quantum, necessary to realize the dynamics of many collision
models is not known. In this work, we extend the quantum homogenizer to the
non-Markovian regime by introducing intra-ancilla interactions mediated by
Fredkin gates, and study the nature of its memory. Using entanglement measures
and relying only on the local dynamics as a witness, we prove the model can be
realized with either classical or quantum memory, depending on the
initialization of the reservoir and the propagation of non-classical
correlations within the reservoir. We further explore how quantum memory
emerges across a wide range of practical scenarios. The results shed light on
the origin of memory in open quantum systems and can advent the design of
near-term quantum technologies for a variety of applications.

Result: 提供了形式化定义、酉构造和收敛保证，资源分析显示算法在迷宫大小和路径长度上具有高效扩展性。

Conclusion: 该算法为量子混合路径规划和搜索奠定了基础，并可扩展到树状或无环图等其他搜索领域。

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving perfect mazes by casting the
pathfinding task as a structured search problem. Building on Grover's amplitude
amplification, the algorithm encodes all candidate paths in superposition and
evaluates their proximity to the goal using a reversible fitness operator based
on quantum arithmetic. A Grover-compatible oracle marks high-fitness states,
and an adaptive cutoff strategy refines the search iteratively. We provide
formal definitions, unitary constructions, and convergence guarantees, along
with a resource analysis showing efficient scaling with maze size and path
length. The framework serves as a foundation for quantum-hybrid pathfinding and
planning. The full algorithmic pipeline is specified from encoding to
amplification, including oracle design and fitness evaluation. The approach is
readily extensible to other search domains, including navigation over tree-like
or acyclic graphs.

Conclusion: 结合上下界结果，几乎完全确定了单量子比特层析的复杂度。

Abstract: We provide the first non-trivial lower bounds for single-qubit tomography

$\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d},d=2^N$ to within $\varepsilon$ trace distance.
Pauli measurements, the most commonly used single-qubit measurement scheme,
have recently been shown to require at most
$O\left(\frac{10^N}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ copies for this problem. Combining
these results, we nearly settle the long-standing question of the complexity of

TL;DR: QGANs用于生成金融时间序列的合成数据，以增强神经网络训练集。研究发现量子相关性有助于生成符合目标分布和时间相关性的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融时间序列数据有限且唯一，传统GAN生成的数据可能不符合特定属性（如分布或时间相关性）。

Method: 训练由量子生成器和经典判别器组成的QGAN，采用量子电路全模拟和张量网络近似模拟两种方法。

Result: 生成的合成时间序列符合目标分布并展现时间相关性，质量受超参数和模拟方法影响。

Conclusion: QGANs在生成金融时间序列方面表现良好，量子相关性有助于提升生成数据的质量。

Abstract: Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) have been investigated as a
method for generating synthetic data with the goal of augmenting training data
sets for neural networks. This is especially relevant for financial time
series, since we only ever observe one realization of the process, namely the
historical evolution of the market, which is further limited by data
availability and the age of the market. However, for classical generative
adversarial networks it has been shown that generated data may (often) not
exhibit desired properties (also called stylized facts), such as matching a
certain distribution or showing specific temporal correlations. Here, we
investigate whether quantum correlations in quantum inspired models of QGANs
can help in the generation of financial time series. We train QGANs, composed
of a quantum generator and a classical discriminator, and investigate two
approaches for simulating the quantum generator: a full simulation of the
quantum circuits, and an approximate simulation using tensor network methods.
We tested how the choice of hyperparameters, such as the circuit depth and bond
dimensions, influenced the quality of the generated time series. The QGAN that
we trained generate synthetic financial time series that not only match the
target distribution but also exhibit the desired temporal correlations, with
the quality of each property depending on the hyperparameters and simulation
method.

Motivation: 大数据和人工智能时代对高效数据存储和处理的需求推动了量子图像处理（QIP）的发展，以利用量子计算解决复杂挑战。

Method: 比较了四种QImRs（TNR、FRQI、NEQR、QPIE）的压缩性能，并评估了量子内核在分类任务中的表现。

Result: FRQI在图像压缩上表现最佳；量子内核分类准确率与经典方法相当，但资源需求更低。

Conclusion: 量子图像处理在压缩和分类任务中具有潜力，尤其是FRQI和量子内核表现突出。

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of
data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are
two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and
analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between
quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to
alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum
computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of
four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network
Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel
Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding
(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image
information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off
between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the
performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear
kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable
classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for
image storage.

Abstract: We study the variational optimization of entangled probe states for quantum
sensing tasks involving the estimation of a structured linear function of local
phase parameters. Specifically, we consider scenarios where each qubit in a
spin-1/2 array accumulates a phase phi_i = alpha_i * theta, with a known weight
vector alpha, reducing the task to single-parameter estimation of theta. Using
parameterized quantum circuits composed of dipolar-interacting gates and global
rotations, we optimize probe states with respect to the Classical Fisher
Information (CFI) using a gradient-free evolutionary strategy. We benchmark the
optimized circuits for two relevant cases: (i) uniform encoding, where all
qubits contribute equally to the phase function, and (ii) a custom encoding
where a central qubit dominates the weight vector. In both cases, the optimized
probe states approach the respective entanglement-enhanced (EE) limits dictated
by the encoding structure. Our results demonstrate the power of variational
approaches for tailoring metrologically useful entanglement to specific
estimation tasks in quantum sensor networks.

Method: 通过分析测量结果概率层面的集中效应，并利用假设检验工具，开发了一个诊断框架。

Result: 应用该框架发现，量子自然梯度、基于样本的优化和某些神经网络启发的初始化方法无法在有限测量预算下克服指数集中效应。

Conclusion: 尽管这些方法可能在其他方面有助于训练，但它们在克服指数集中效应方面存在局限性。

Abstract: Identifying scalable circuit architectures remains a central challenge in
variational quantum computing and quantum machine learning. Many approaches
have been proposed to mitigate or avoid the barren plateau phenomenon or, more
broadly, exponential concentration. However, due to the intricate interplay
between quantum measurements and classical post-processing, we argue these
techniques often fail to circumvent concentration effects in practice. Here, by
analyzing concentration at the level of measurement outcome probabilities and
leveraging tools from hypothesis testing, we develop a practical framework for
diagnosing whether a parameterized quantum model is inhibited by exponential
concentration. Applying this framework, we argue that several widely used
methods (including quantum natural gradient, sample-based optimization, and
certain neural-network-inspired initializations) do not overcome exponential
concentration with finite measurement budgets, though they may still aid
training in other ways.

Abstract: Characterization of the dynamics of an impurity immersed in a quantum medium
is vital for fundamental understanding of matter as well as applications in
modern day quantum technologies. The case of strong and long-ranged
interactions is of particular importance here, as it opens the possibility to
leverage quantum correlations in controlling the system properties. Here, we
consider a charged impurity moving in a bosonic gas and study its properties
out of equilibrium. We extract the stationary momentum of the ion at long
times, which is nonzero due to the superfluid nature of the medium, and the
effective mass which stems from dressing the impurity with the host atoms. The
nonlinear evolution leads not only to emission of density waves, but also
momentum transfer back to the ion, resulting in the possibility of oscillatory
dynamics.

Conclusion: 该理论为理解多组分超流体的动态性质提供了新视角，并揭示了其独特的涡旋行为和相变特性。

Abstract: We introduce a class of dynamical field theories for $N$-component
"Borromean" ($N\geq 3$) super-counterfluid order, naturally formulated in terms
of inter-species bosonic fields $\psi_{\alpha\beta}$. Their condensation breaks
the normal-state [U(1)]$^N$ symmetry down to its diagonal U(1) subgroup,
thereby encoding the arrest of the net superflow. This approach broadens our
understanding of dynamical properties of super-counterfluids, at low energies
capturing its universal properties, phase transition, counterflow vortices, and
many of its other properties. Such super-counterfluid strikingly exhibits $N$
distinct flavors of energetically stable elementary vortex solutions, despite
$\mathbb{Z}^{N-1}$ homotopy group of its $N\! -\! 1$ independent Goldstone
modes, with $N\! -\! 1$ topologically distinct elementary vortex types, obeying
modular arithmetic. The model leads to Borromean hydrodynamics as a low-energy
theory, reveals counteflow AC Josephson effect, and generically predicts a
first-order character of the phase transitions into Borromean
super-counterfluid state in dimensions greater than two.

Here we study the properties of the droplets when subjected to harmonic

analytical approaches. We map out the phase diagram between bound droplets and
the unbound gas state and the form of the ground states. We additionally
consider how the droplet solutions are modified by the presence of a central
vortex and use these results to estimate the critical rotation frequency for
vortices to be energetically favored. Our work helps to understand the physics
of self-bound droplets and vortex droplets in flattened geometries.

Abstract: Rabi-coupled spinor Bose-Einstein condensates, with competing intra-and
interspecies interactions, enable independent control of two-and three-body
interactions. We show that coupling can also drive the system into a strongly
nonlinear regime of saturating interaction. More precisely, the equation of
state interpolates between low-and high-density regimes described by two
different two-body scattering lengths. Interestingly, the transition can be
determined by the strength of the coupling. We experimentally demonstrate this
saturation phenomenon by measurements of the interaction energy of a
Bose-Einstein condensate as a function of the detuning and of the strength of
the Rabi coupling in spin mixtures of potassium 39.

Abstract: We show that strongly correlated impurities confined in an optical lattice
can form localized, molecule-like dimer states in the presence of a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By systematically studying the effect of the
lattice potential on this mixture, we reveal the two roles of the condensate in
assisting the formation of dimerized impurities: mediating the attractive
interaction among impurities and rescaling the lattice potential of impurities.
At strong coupling between the impurities and the condensate, the two
mechanisms cooperate to induce a structural transition, resulting in the
rearrangement of dimers. We also show that the nonequilibrium dynamics of these
states can be interpreted as a dimerized soliton train.

Conclusion: 研究证实了OFSS的存在，并揭示了热力学极限下的动力学标度行为，为理解非平衡相变提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior of two-dimensional and
three-dimensional Ising systems, when they are slowly driven across their {\em
magnetic} first-order transitions at low temperature $T<T_c$, where $T_c$ is
the temperature of their continuous transition. We consider Kibble-Zurek (KZ)
protocols in which a spatially homogenous magnetic field $h$ varies as
$h(t)=t/t_s$ with a time scale $t_s$. The KZ dynamics starts from
negatively-magnetized configurations equilibrated at $h_i<0$ and stops at a
positive value of $h$ where the configurations acquire a positive average
magnetization. We consider the Metropolis and the heat-bath dynamics, which are
two specific examples of a purely relaxational dynamics. We focus on two
different dynamic regimes. We consider the out-equilibrium finite-size scaling
(OFSS) limit in which the system size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$ diverge
simultaneously, keeping an appropriate combination fixed. Then, we analyze the
KZ dynamics in the thermodynamic limit (TL), obtained by taking first the
$L\to\infty$ limit at fixed $t$ and $t_s$, and then considering the scaling
behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit. Our numerical results provide evidence of
OFSS, as predicted by general scaling arguments. The results in the TL show the
emergence of spinodal-like behaviors: The passage from the
negatively-magnetized phase to the positively-magnetized one occurs at positive
values $h_*>0$ of the magnetic field, which decrease as $h_* \sim 1/(\ln
t_s)^\kappa$, with $\kappa = 2$ and $\kappa=1$ in two and three dimensions,
respectively, for $t_s\to\infty$. We identify $\sigma \equiv t (\ln
t)^\kappa/t_s$ as the relevant scaling variable associated with the KZ dynamics
in the TL.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了沙堆模型中时间相关性的复杂标度特征。

Abstract: We consider the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) and the Manna sandpile models of
self-organized criticality. In the models, previous studies revealed a
signature of long-range temporal correlations in the avalanche activity. We
examine the power spectra of the noises with different system sizes and find
that the power spectrum for a finite-size system exhibits three distinct
frequency regimes: (i) a frequency-independent behavior below a lower cutoff
frequency, (ii) a hump-type behavior in the intermediate-frequency regime, and
(iii) a power-law scaling $1/f^{\alpha}$ in the high-frequency regime. The
power scales with the system size in all regimes, but with different exponents.
Also, the lower cutoff and peak frequencies decay in a power-law manner with
the system size. We apply finite-size scaling and obtain data collapse for the
power spectra, corroborating the estimation of the scaling exponents. Our
studies reveal subtle scaling features for the temporal correlation within the
avalanches.

Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully
exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while
capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a
two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations
and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a
dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained
to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the
generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications
with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase
accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively
reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with
deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and
future perspectives are critically discussed.

Abstract: Partition function zeros are powerful tools in understanding critical
behavior. In this paper we present new results of the Fisher zeros of
two-dimensional Ising models, in the framework of free-fermion eight-vertex
model. First we succeed in finding special boundary conditions for the
free-fermion model, under which the partition function of a finite lattice can
be expressed in a double product form. Using appropriate mappings, these
boundary conditions are transformed into the corresponding versions of the
square, triangular and honeycomb lattice Ising models. Each Ising model is
studied in the cases of a zero field and of an imaginary field $i(\pi/2)k_BT$.
For the square lattice model we rediscover the famous Brascamp-Kunz (B-K)
boundary conditions. For the triangular and honeycomb lattice models we obtain
the B-K type boundary conditions, and the Fisher zeros are conveniently solved
from the product form of partition function. The advantage of B-K type boundary
conditions is that the Fisher zeros of any finite lattice exactly lie on
certain loci, and the accumulation points of zeros can be easily determined in
the thermodynamic limit. Our finding and method would be very helpful in
studying the partition function zeros of vertex and Ising models.

Abstract: Complex systems exhibit macroscopic behaviors that emerge from the
coordinated interactions of their individual components. Understanding the
microscopic origins of these emergent properties remains challenging,
particularly in systems beyond canonical examples, due to the absence of a
generalized framework for identifying the governing degrees of freedom. The
multiscale complexity formalism aims to address this challenge by employing
information-theoretic indices of structure to identify the scales at which
collective behaviors emerge. In this paper, we evaluate the complexity profile
index as a tool for identifying such scales by applying it to two-dimensional
ferromagnetic Ising systems. We demonstrate that these systems exhibit
multiscale behavior in the critical region, and the emergence of macroscopic
magnetization in the ordered phase corresponds to a non-monotonic behavior of
the complexity profile at large scales. Additionally, we show that the pairwise
complexity exhibits a maximum in the disordered phase that remains bounded in
the thermodynamic limit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究晶格异常的性质及其在量子多体系统中的作用，为晶格系统的对称性提供统一理论框架。

Method: 通过系统分析和严格定义晶格异常，研究其与QFT异常的异同，并开发理论工具分类其影响。

Result: 发现晶格异常与QFT异常并非一一对应，且晶格异常具有独特性质，如IR平凡性，并对对称哈密顿量有重要影响。

Conclusion: 晶格异常为量子多体系统的对称性提供了新视角，并可能启发QFT对称性的新研究方向。

Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum
many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a
systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in
lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice
anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological
invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems
allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of
the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the
expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial
differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not,
contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can
be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they
admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies
at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including
IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right,
including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body
localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make
substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop
several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric
Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems
into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on
symmetries in QFT.

Conclusion: 揭示了磁序与拓扑相的丰富共存现象，为自旋液体相的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Spin-orbital generalizations of Kitaev model, such as Yao-Lee model, have
attracted recent attention due to their enhanced stability of spin liquid
phases against perturbations. Motivated by microscopic calculations for the
realization of Yao-Lee model showing additional interactions, we study the
phase diagram of the Yao-Lee model with added Kitaev and Heisenberg terms.
While the plaquette operator is conserved even in the presence of added
perturbations, the model becomes no longer exactly solvable. Using perturbation
and Majorana mean-field theory, we find magnetic order can arise in the spin
sector while the orbital sector remains a liquid for dominant Kitaev
interactions, whereas both sectors form liquid phases when Yao-Lee interactions
dominate. Additional Heisenberg exchange can enhance or suppress the magnetic
order, revealing a rich coexistence of magnetic and topological phases.

Abstract: We present counterexamples to the lore that symmetries that cannot be gauged
or made on-site are necessarily anomalous. Specifically, we construct unitary,
internal symmetries of two-dimensional lattice models that cannot be
consistently coupled to background or dynamical gauge fields or disentangled to
a tensor product of on-site operators. These symmetries are nevertheless
anomaly-free in the sense that they admit symmetric, gapped Hamiltonians with
unique, invertible ground states. We show that symmetries of this kind are
characterized by an index $[\omega]\in H^2(G,\mathbb{Q}_+)$, where
$\mathbb{Q}_+$ is the multiplicative group of rational numbers labeling
one-dimensional quantum cellular automata.

Motivation: 探索κ-BEST-CN的性质，以作为κ-ET-CN的化学加压类似物，帮助理解κ-ET-CN中的异常性质。

Method: 通过电阻率测量和磁化率分析，比较κ-BEST-CN与κ-ET-CN的电学和磁学行为。

Result: κ-BEST-CN在约0.1 GPa压力下表现出超导性（起始温度~4 K），且磁化率行为与κ-ET-CN不同。

Conclusion: κ-BEST-CN是研究κ-ET-CN异常性质的重要参考材料，其磁学行为为理论研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We report the structural, electrical, and magnetic properties of the organic
conductor $\kappa$-(BEST)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (BEST:
bis(ethylenediseleno)tetrathiafulvalene; abbreviated as $\kappa$-BEST-CN),
which is isostructural with the quantum spin liquid candidate
$\kappa$-(ET)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ (ET: bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene;
abbreviated as $\kappa$-ET-CN). Resistivity measurements demonstrate that
$\kappa$-BEST-CN exhibits semiconducting behavior, governed by the same
conducting mechanism as $\kappa$-ET-CN. Under a pressure of ~0.1 GPa,
$\kappa$-BEST-CN undergoes a superconducting transition with an onset
temperature of ~4 K. From the comparison of the critical pressures of
superconductivity between $\kappa$-ET-CN and $\kappa$-BEST-CN, $\kappa$-BEST-CN
can be regarded as a chemically pressurized analogue of $\kappa$-ET-CN.
Therefore, $\kappa$-BEST-CN, in which only the effective pressure changes
without altering the anion structure, is considered a valuable reference
material for elucidating the enigmatic properties observed in $\kappa$-ET-CN.
Furthermore, the spin susceptibility of $\kappa$-BEST-CN is slightly larger
than that of $\kappa$-ET-CN and shows weaker temperature dependence, which
cannot be explained by the localized spin model. This behavior clarifies the
anomalous magnetic properties of a system with frustration near the Mott
transition, serving to stimulate future theoretical research.

Method: 采用场扫描协议测量纵向和横向热导率，并考虑磁场步进后的弛豫效应以提高分辨率。

Result: 未检测到明显的横向热导率信号（上限为$|\kappa_{xy}/T| <1\times10^{-4}$ Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$），纵向热导率与先前研究一致。低温下观察到$\kappa/T$随磁场线性下降及弱磁滞现象。

Conclusion: La$_2$CuO$_4$在研究的温度和磁场范围内横向热导率信号极弱，纵向热导率行为与已知研究相符。

Abstract: We investigated the longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ and
thermal hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ in La$_2$CuO$_4$ at temperatures $T$
between 2 and 20 K in magnetic fields $H$ up to 10 T. Within the temperature
and field intervals studied, we do not resolve any thermal Hall signal with a
conservative upper bound of $|\kappa_{xy}/T| <1\times10^{-4}$ ${\rm
Wm^{-1}K^{-2}}$. The longitudinal thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}/T$ agrees
well with previous studies, in both magnitude and $T$ dependence. In both
channels, we performed measurements using the field-sweep protocol. To achieve
high resolution, we carefully took into account relaxation effects after each
step-increase in $H$. At low $T$, we find a linear decrease in $\kappa/T$ vs.
$H$, as well as weak hysteresis near the meta-magnetic transition of the spin
degrees.

Conclusion: 研究阐明了平面霍尔效应中非对角耦合的关键特性，为未来研究和应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: The Hall effect, particularly that arising from in-plane magnetic field, has
recently emerged as a sensitive probe of quantum geometric properties in
solids. Especially in trigonal systems, in-plane anomalous Hall effect (AHE)
can be explicitly induced by nontrivial off-diagonal coupling between the
magnetic field and the Hall vector on the principal plane. Here we elucidate
multipolar dependence of the off-diagonal coupling in the in-plane AHE, by
systematically measuring on the (001) principal plane of trigonal
antiferromagnet EuCd2Sb2 thin films for each magnetic phase. Around zero field,
magneto-cubic dependence of anomalous Hall resistivity is clearly observed not
only in the paramagnetic phase but also even in the antiferromagnetic phase. An
off-diagonal component of the octupolar tensor also exhibits unconventional
decay above the magnetic ordering temperature, roughly depending on the inverse
temperature to the third power. In the forced ferromagnetic phase, on the other
hand, magneto-linear dependence dominantly appears and notably persists up to
very high fields. Our findings clarify key aspects of the off-diagonal coupling
in the in-plane AHE, paving the way for its future investigations and potential
applications beyond conventional expectations about the Hall effect.

for a systematic identification of unknown or exotic order parameters in

Conclusion: 研究揭示了相互作用、阻挫和磁场共同作用下的复杂基态相，为理解S=1自旋系统提供了关键见解。

Abstract: The spin-$1$ orthogonal dimer chain is investigated using the Density Matrix
Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm. A transformation to a basis that uses
the local eigenstates of the orthogonal dimers, while retaining the local spin
states for the parallel spins, allows for more effective implementation of the
symmetries, as well as mitigating the entanglement bias of DMRG. A rich ground
state phase diagram is obtained in the parameter space spanned by the ratio of
inter- to intra-dimer interaction (which measures the degree of frustration)
and an external magnetic field. Some ground state phases exhibit effective
Haldane chain character, whereas others exhibit fragmentation of the ground
state wavefunction, or clustering. The phases are characterized by their static
properties, including (local) spin quantum number, entanglement entropy, and
the spin-spin correlation function. Detailed characterization of a carefully
selected set of representative states is presented. The static properties are
complemented by exploring the low-energy dynamics through the calculation of
the dynamic structure factor. The results provide crucial insight into the
emergence of complex ground state phases from the interplay between strong
interactions, geometric frustration, and external magnetic field for
interacting S=1 Heisenberg spins.

Conclusion: 开放量子系统的耗散动力学具有不可逆性，热化行为与封闭系统存在本质差异。

Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of correlated fermions evolving in presence
of a local dephasing bath. To this extent we consider the infinite coordination
limit of the corresponding Lindblad master equation, provided by Dynamical
Mean-Field Theory for open quantum systems. We solve the resulting quantum
impurity problem, describing an Anderson impurity coupled to a local dephasing,
using weak-coupling perturbation theory in interaction and dephasing. We show
that the dissipative dynamics describes heating towards infinite temperature,
with a relaxation rate that depends strongly on interaction. The resulting
steady-state spectral functions are however non-trivial and show an interplay
between coherent quasiparticle peak and local dephasing. We then discuss how
thermalization towards infinite temperature emerges within DMFT, by solving the
impurity problem throughout its self-consistency. We show that thermalization
under open quantum system dynamics is qualitatively different from the closed
system case. In particular, the thermalization front found in the unitary is
strongly modified, a signature of the irreversibility of the open system
dynamics.

Motivation: 探索FeSb2作为可调谐交替磁体的潜力，以及压力对其电子结构和拓扑输运性质的影响。

Method: 采用密度泛函理论（DFT）和Wannier函数分析，结合密度泛函微扰理论（DFPT）计算声子稳定性。

Result: FeSb2在10 GPa下仍保持动态稳定；压力导致能带交叉和Berry曲率重新分布，反常霍尔电导率在-1至1 eV范围内显著。

Conclusion: FeSb2是一种可通过压力调节拓扑输运和动态稳定性的交替磁体，为应变工程霍尔响应提供了机会。

Abstract: We have investigated the pressure-dependent electronic structure, phonon
stability, and anomalous Hall response of the recently discovered altermagnet
FeSb2 from density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier function analysis. From
density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations, we have found that
FeSb2 remains dynamically stable up to 10 GPa, evidenced by positive phonon
frequencies. Our spin-polarised band structure shows that the node of band
crossing between spin-up and spin-down bands around the Fermi energy exactly
lies at the Gamma and A-symmetry points. The Fermi crossing is mostly exhibited
by band-24, band-25 and band-26. The non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS)
along M'-Gamma-M and A-Z-A' symmetry is attributed to the broken time-reversal
(PT ) symmetry. There are significant changes in the band profile under applied
pressure, as one can see the shifting of the node of band-24 and band-26
towards the lower energy side. The NRSS exhibited by band-24 along M'-Gamma-M
symmetry is notably small. Although the strength of NRSS of band-26 along
A-Z-A' symmetry is significant but reduces under applied pressure. The
anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) values are prominent in -1 to 1 eV range. A
sharp peaked and positive AHC values at ambient pressure, becomes spectrally
broadened and negative at 10 GPa due to pressure-induced band crossings and
redistribution of Berry curvature near the Fermi level. We have observed that
the values of spin hall conductivity (SHC) are around 2-2.5 times lower as
compared to AHC and prominent in between -1.0 eV to 1.0 eV. Our results
establish FeSb2 as a tunable altermagnetic candidate where pressure can
modulate both topological transport and dynamic stability, offering
opportunities for strain-engineered Hall responses in compensated magnetic
systems.

Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum processors have recently grown to reach 100s of
physical qubits. As the number of qubits continues to grow, new challenges
associated with scaling arise, such as device variability reduction and
integration with cryogenic electronics for I/O management. Spin qubits in
silicon quantum dots provide a platform where these problems may be mitigated,
having demonstrated high control and readout fidelities and compatibility with
large-scale manufacturing techniques of the semiconductor industry. Here, we
demonstrate the monolithic integration of 384 p-type quantum dots, each
embedded in a silicon transistor, with on-chip digital and analog electronics,
all operating at deep cryogenic temperatures. The chip is fabricated using
22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS technology. We extract
key quantum dot parameters by fast readout and automated machine learning
routines to determine the link between device dimensions and quantum dot yield,
variability, and charge noise figures. Overall, our results demonstrate a path
to monolithic integration of quantum and classical electronics at scale.

Abstract: The excitations of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states have been
largely inaccessible to experimental probes until recently. New electron
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) results from Hu et.al. (2023) show promise
in detecting and identifying these excited states via the local density of
states (LDOS) spectrum. On a torus, there exists a mapping to a 1D lattice
Hamiltonian with center-of-mass or dipole moment conservation. In this work, we
apply perturbation theory starting from the thin cylinder limit ($L_x
\rightarrow \infty, L_y <l_B$ for torus dimensions $L_x$ and $L_y$) to obtain
an analytical approach to the low-lying neutral and charged excitations of the
$\nu =1/3$ FQHE state. Notably, in the thin cylinder we can systematically
enumerate all the low-lying excitations by the patterns of 'dipoles' formed by
the electron occupation pattern on the 1D lattice. We find that the
thin-cylinder limit predicts a significant dispersion of the low-lying neutral
excitations but sharpness of the LDOS spectra, which measure charged
excitations. We also discuss connections between our work and several different
approaches to the FQHE STM spectra, including those using the composite fermion
theory. Numerical exact diagonalization beyond the thin-cylinder limit suggests
that the energies of charged excitations remain largely confined to a narrow
range of energies, which in experiments might appear as a single peak.

Abstract: Fractional topological phases, such as the fractional quantum Hall state,
usually rely on strong interactions to generate ground state degeneracy with
gap protection and fractionalized topological response. Here, we propose a
fractional topological phase without interaction in $(1+1)$-dimension, which is
driven by the Stark localization on top of topological flat bands, different
from the conventional mechanism of the strongly correlated fractional
topological phases. A linear potential gradient applied to the flat bands
drives the Stark localization, under which the Stark localized states may
hybridize and leads to a new gap in the real space, dubbed the real space
energy gap (RSEG). Unlike the integer topological band insulator obtained in
the weak linear potential regime without closing the original bulk gap, the
fractional topological Stark insulating phase is resulted from the RSEG when
the linear potential gradient exceeds a critical value. We develop a
theoretical formalism to characterize the fractional topological Stark
insulator, and further show that the many-body state under topological pumping
returns to the initial state only after multiple $2\pi$ periods of evolution,
giving the fractional charge pumping, similar to that in fractional quantum
Hall state. Finally, we propose how to realize the fractional topological Stark
insulator in real experiment.

with subsequent van der Waals bonding. Using hBN/graphene heterostructures
transferred onto metallic island arrays as a model system, we reveal that
thermal cycling between room and cryogenic temperatures leads to irreversible
changes in electronic properties. This breakdown of reproducibility stems from
the temperature-dependent redistribution of interfacial water or organic
residues, which disrupts van der Waals bonding via a hydrophobic collapse
mechanism. Our findings establish constraints for low-temperature applications
of transferred 2D devices while providing insights into interfacial stability
in van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Magneto-transport properties of a two-dimensional electron gas in a chain of
planar quantum rings are investigated under the Rashba spin-orbit interaction
and a transverse homogeneous magnetic field. A modulation potential function
models the ring-chain periodicity along one direction and the confinement in
the perpendicular one. The electron energy minibands collapse into discrete
levels with high degeneracy at specific magnetic field values. The Rashba
effect significantly influences the system's properties. Calculations reveal a
transition from diamagnetic to paramagnetic behavior in the spin-difference
orbital magnetization at high Rashba coupling strengths. This is consistent
with the reversal of the spin-difference persistent current observed at the
same Rashba values. Total and spin-difference magnetizations exhibit
oscillations linked to miniband nodes. The longitudinal magnetoconductance
component shows oscillations resembling Shubnikov-De Haas behavior, while the
transverse component displays a ladder-like profile reminiscent of the quantum
Hall effect. However, both phenomena are more closely associated with the
periodic collapse of minibands, leading to strong density-of-states
oscillations, rather than with the mechanisms behind the quantum Hall effect.
This highlights the rich physics of quantum topological phases in
nanostructures with non-trivial geometry. At high Rashba coupling, this
behavior degrades. Spin magnetization shows pronounced oscillations, indicating
complex interplay between the Zeeman and Rashba effects on spin polarization.
These results offer insights into experimentally relevant electronic and spin
characteristics attainable in modulated semiconductor structures, contributing
to the development of advanced 2D-based materials for magneto-transport and
spintronics applications.

Abstract: Magnetic adatom chains on superconductors provide a platform to explore
correlated spin states and emergent quantum phases. Using low-temperature
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we study the distance-dependent interaction
between Fe atoms on 2H-NbSe$_2$. While single atoms exhibit four
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and partially occupied $d$ levels consistent with a
$S=2$ spin state, the spin is quenched when two Fe atoms reside in nearest
neighbor lattice sites, where the $d$ levels of the atoms hybridize. The
non-magnetic dimer configuration is stable in that dimerization persists in
chains with weak interactions among the dimers. Thus, the spin-state quenching
has important implications also for Fe chains. While even-numbered chains are
stable and non-magnetic, odd-numbered chains host a single magnetic atom at one
of the chain's ends, with its position being switchable by voltage pulses. Our
findings emphasize the role of interatomic coupling in shaping quantum ground
states and suggest that engineering alternating hopping amplitudes analogous to
the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model may offer a pathway to realizing topological
systems.

Abstract: The task of finding a consistent relationship between a quantum Hamiltonian
and a classical Lagrangian is of utmost importance for basic, but ubiquitous
techniques like canonical quantization and path integrals. Nonconvex kinetic
energies (which appear, e.g., in Wilczek and Shapere's classical time crystal,
or nonlinear capacitors) pose a fundamental problem: the Legendre
transformation is ill-defined, and the more general Legendre-Fenchel
transformation removes nonconvexity essentially by definition. Arguing that
such anomalous theories follow from suitable low-energy approximations of
well-defined, harmonic theories, we show that seemingly inconsistent
Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions can both be valid, depending on the
coupling strength to a dissipative environment. Essentially there occurs a
dissipative phase transition from a non-convex Hamiltonian to a convex
Lagrangian regime, involving exceptional points in imaginary time. This
resolves apparent inconsistencies and provide computationally efficient methods
to treat anomalous, nonconvex kinetic energies.

Abstract: The electronic quality of two-dimensional systems is crucial when exploring
quantum transport phenomena. In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of
optimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport
and quantum mobilities reaching close to 10$^8$ and 10$^6$ cm$^2$/Vs,
respectively. Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving,
it remains comparatively lower. Here we report a transformative improvement in
the electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its
immediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge
inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10$^7$
cm$^-2$ and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum
mobilities reach 10$^7$ cm$^2$/Vs, surpassing those in the highest-quality
semiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport
mobilities match their record. This quality enables Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaus below 5 mT.
Although proximity screening predictably suppresses electron-electron
interactions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their
energy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3-5 compared to unscreened devices,
demonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm
remain robust. Our results offer a reliable route to improving electronic
quality in graphene and other two-dimensional systems, which should facilitate
the exploration of new physics previously obscured by disorder.

Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as
mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the
latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two
phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting
phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic
field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a
sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer
Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit
sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset
temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our
observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and
topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new
frontier in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: We investigate the spin-polarized ballistic transport in a three-terminal
Zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR) device using a tight binding model,
non-equilibrium Green function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
framework. We study the transmission spectrum, density of states, I-V
characteristics, spin-resolved conductance and spin current by varying ribbon
geometries and an out-of-plane Zeeman field. In absence of magnetization,
transport is dominated by subband quantization and resonant edge states, with
pronounced dependence on ribbon width and length while the introduction of a
Zeeman field offers spin-selective transport and inducing half-metallic
behavior, particularly in narrower ribbons, highlighting the interplay between
quantum confinement, edge-localized states and spin-dependent interactions.
Moreover, we found Fabry-P\'{e}rot-like interference in conductance spectrum
and bias-driven mode activation with strong spin filtering effects. The spin
current is found to be tunable via magnetic field and gate voltage. Also, it
remains stable under thermal fluctuations, demonstrating suitability for
room-temperature operation. Finally, the energy and width dependence of the
Fano factor reveals distinct quantum interference features and spin-polarized
transport signatures. These findings indicate the potential of the
three-terminal ZGNR based device for scalable and gate-controllable spintronic
applications.
