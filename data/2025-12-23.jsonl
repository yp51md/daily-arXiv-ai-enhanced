These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites."}

In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the \"modulated wiggle well,\" which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $μ$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting."}

Our analysis reveals a characteristic evolution of the wave-packet center of mass, which undergoes an initial acceleration, subsequently slows down, and ultimately enters a regime of uniform motion, accompanied throughout by exponential amplification of the wave-packet amplitude. To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the Hatano-Nelson chain. Our results elucidate the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity in generating unconventional transport phenomena, and pave the way for controlling wave dynamics in nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian metamaterials."}

We derive an integral representation of the distribution function that works equally well for systems of any symmetry and for any type of coupling to the measuring device. From this integral representation we find explicit analytic expressions for the distribution function in the case of disordered metallic grains.

Recent numerical studies in several microscopic models reveal that increasing the bandwidth in an FCI can drive a direct transition into a charge-2e superconductor rather than a conventional Fermi liquid. Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $ν= 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes. Our results reveal a rich landscape of exotic superconductors with no normal state Fermi surface and predict novel higher-charge superconductors coexisting with neutral non-Abelian topological order at more general filling fractions $ν= p/(2p+1)$."}

For a Lennard-Jones solvent, we demonstrate that this approach yields acceptable accuracy in estimating free energy differences for challenging transformations, such as solute growth or increased solute-solute separation, which typically demand multiple intermediate simulation steps along the transformation. Analysis of radial distribution functions indicates that the flow generates physically meaningful solvent rearrangements, substantially enhancing configurational overlap between states in configuration space.

Already, the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is the cornerstone of many quantum algorithms, but the Laplace transform or its discrete version has not seen any efficient implementation on quantum computers due to its dissipative nature and hence non-unitary dynamics. However, a recent work has shown an efficient implementation for certain cases on quantum computers using the Taylor series. Unlike previous work, our work provides a completely different algorithm for doing Laplace Transform using Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation and Lap-LCHS, very efficiently at points which form an arithmetic progression. Our algorithm can implement $N \\times N$ discrete Laplace transform in gate complexity that grows as $O((log\\,N)^3)$, ignoring the state preparation cost, where $N=2^n$ and $n$ is the number of qubits, which is a superpolynomial speedup in number of gates over the best classical counterpart that has complexity $O(N\\cdot log\\,N)$ for the same cases. Also, the circuit width grows as $O(log\\,N)$. Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT) may enable new Quantum algorithms for cases like solving differential equations in the Laplace domain, developing an inverse Laplace transform algorithm on quantum computers, imaginary time evolution in the resolvent domain for calculating ground state energy, and spectral estimation of non-Hermitian matrices."}

Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation.

The resulting diagrams reveal three regimes: a completely extended phase, a completely localized phase, and a mixed domain where localized and extended states coexist. In the diagrams, we investigate the behaviors of tightly and loosely wound helices and examine a special case where the number of sites per turn is a Fibonacci number. For moderate numbers of sites per helical turn, the mixed region is broad and also shifts with the long-range coupling. When the turn size is a Fibonacci number, the phase boundary becomes nearly horizontal and the mixed region fades out, effectively recovering the standard Aubry-André model behavior."}

Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moiré electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the electronic crystalline nature of correlated phases, opening avenues for probing and manipulating collective excitations in correlated electron systems."}

We here derive conditions on external time-dependent drivings, under which current reversals occur in lattice gases with arbitrary pair interactions.

And second, we present a way of implementing logical CNOT gates on Floquet codes via Dehn twists. We discuss the requirements for these techniques, and show that they are applicable to a wide family of Floquet codes defined on colour code lattices. Through numerical benchmarking of the logical operations on the CCS Floquet code, we establish a logical-gate threshold of 0.25-0.35% and verify sub-threshold exponential error suppression.

As the quasiperiodic amplitude is increased, the system exhibits reentrant behavior, localizing, partially re-delocalizing into a multifractal regime, and re-localizing, verified via two-size crossings of band-averaged observables and finite-size scaling. We demonstrate that tuning the modulation strength, the SSH dimerization, or the incommensurability parameter provides control over the critical thresholds. Our results suggest a versatile, randomness-free platform for the deterministic control of transport, enabling switching between conducting, multifractal, and insulating states."}

On its face, it repudiates many of the key features of the mechanical conception of physical reality. However, the challenge of developing a precise, coherent alternative to that conception has yet to be met. Here, I argue that a major hindrance to the project of quantum interpretation is its existing interpretative methodologies, which suffer from a lack of systematicity in their judgements about what aspects of the theory are interpretational relevant. In particular, I argue that current interpretations tend to marginalize the informal part of the theory in favour of its formal part, and place inappropriate emphasis on the natural language component of the formalism over its detailed mathematical structure. To counterbalance these biases, I propose that an interpretation-free zone be constructed around the theory, wherein an interpreter initially adopt a descriptive stance which considers all parts of the theory, and that the results of this deliberation~(and the judgements about what facts are interpretationally relevant) are reported as part of their interpretation.\n  I argue that the interpretation of quantum theory poses special challenges and difficulties which necessitate this interpretation-free zone, and that existing interpretative methodologies are insufficient to address them. Further, I argue that a reconstructive interpretative methodology, which harnesses the recent results of the quantum reconstruction program, provides a powerful means to identify almost all facts that could be interpretationally relevant, and naturally meets these challenges and difficulties. Moreover, I argue that the quantum reconstruction program offers a powerful way to discover new physical principles, and offers a systematic pathway to build a rich, coherent conception of quantum reality."}

Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order. Using realistic parameter estimates for experimentally accessible heterostructures, we demonstrate that these signatures are well within measurable ranges, establishing Zeeman quantum geometry as a powerful and general framework for characterizing unconventional magnetic insulators via their gyrotropic transport responses."}

Despite a few decades of research, a comprehensive and systematic rigorous characterisation of their spatial and, even more, time dependent properties has remained elusive. Among the obstacles, we can mention their out of equilibrium and non-linear dynamics features which prevent, in general, the access to the stationary properties explicitly. In fact, even the knowledge of the stationary state is quite exceptional in sandpiles. In that respect, it has become standard to develop a model to model strategy and, so to say, general results or tools applicable to these systems are missing. In this paper, we unveil general and simple properties of time transport correlations in certain classes of abelian sandpile models. We proceed gradually, starting from results applicable in a broad context, to more and more specific ones, consequently valid to smaller and smaller classes. For instance, we show, under a few hypothesis, that the number of particles dissipated displays mostly anticorrelation in time. Besides, on a more integrable point of view, the approach followed might culminate with the proof of a link between 2-points time transport correlations and the second moment of the integrated transport over time. To be clear, these two quantities are related through a linear system of equations which is explicitly solved and applies to at least three 1D sandpile models, namely the Directed Stochastic Sandpile, the Oslo and the Activated Random Walk (in a peculiar setup) models."}

The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures.

To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon, i.e., Schottky-like specific-heat anomalies in frustrated systems. These results clarify the nature of phases and phase transitions in frustrated Ising systems and their exponents, and additionally provide inspiration for experimental efforts to search for the spiral state and Schottky-like anomalies."}

The combination of Potts symmetry and nonreciprocity gives rise to a rich phase diagram. The nonreciprocal phase shift generates either counter-clockwise or clockwise chirality. Potts symmetry can be broken spontaneously. Consequently, the system exhibits four distinct phases: A species-mixed chiral phase where particles perform counter-clockwise chiral motion with quasi-long-range order, a species separation phase where Potts symmetry is broken and species-separated particles form vortex cells with clockwise chirality, a coexistence phase, and a disordered phase. We derive a Boltzmann equation and a hydrodynamic equation describing the system in the continuum limit, and present analytic arguments for the emergence of chirality and species separation."}

The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components."}

However, for most systems of practical interest, the solution to the Hedin equations is rendered nearly numerically intractable because the Hedin equations are of functional derivative form. Integral equations are much more numerically tractable, than functional derivative equations, as they can often be solved iteratively. In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams."}

Combining a systematic mean-field bifurcation analysis with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions, we map the model's dynamical regimes and transitions. Mean-field theory predicts a rich phase structure -- disorder, a time-dependent 'swap' (limit-cycle) phase, and static ordered states -- separated by Hopf, saddle-node on invariant circle, saddle-node of limit cycles, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations. In two dimensions, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that spiral defects destabilise global swapping and, unless vacancies are strongly favoured, destroy long-range order. Crucially, a finite single-ion anisotropy $Δ_α= - Δ_β$ promotes vacancy occupation in the $α$ species and suppresses nonreciprocal dynamics, thereby restoring a robust static ordered phase. Finite-size scaling of susceptibility and Binder cumulants places the disorder to static transition firmly in the 2D Ising universality class. Moreover, within the static ordered phase, we observe a crossover that sharpens into a line of first-order phase transitions; these two regimes are separated by a critical point, analogous to the termination of the liquid-gas coexistence curve. In three dimensions, simulations largely mirror mean-field expectations, though swap to static ordering occurs indirectly via a disordered regime. Our results demonstrate that vacancy energetics provide a simple, experimentally relevant control knob that stabilises equilibrium-like order in nonreciprocal systems and that defects can generate novel critical behaviour."}

Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials."}

In conventional thermodynamic trade-off relations, the quantities of interest are linear in the underlying probability distribution. Some important information-theoretic quantities, such as Rényi entropies, are nonlinear; however, such nonlinearities are generally more difficult to handle. Inspired by replica techniques used in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we construct Markovian dynamics of identical replicas and derive a lower bound on relative moments in terms of the dynamical activity. We apply our general result to two scenarios. First, for a random walker on a network, we derive an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the position distribution of the walker, which quantifies the extent of diffusion on the network. Remarkably, the bound is expressed solely in terms of escape rate from the initial node, and thus depends only on local information. Second, we consider trajectory observables in Markov processes and obtain an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the distribution of these observables, again in terms of the dynamical activity. This provides an entropic characterization of uncertainty that generalizes existing variance-based thermodynamic uncertainty relations."}

The time mean of the overlap function decays inversely with the effective Hilbert space occupied by the initial state for the non-periodic case. Two different stationary regimes were found for the overlap mean and overlap variance. The state non-classicality was investigated using the roughness measure, and its mean also has two stationary regimes. For large effective Hilbert space, the roughness time mean depends more on the effective space than the initial state.

In contrast to the \"roton minimum\" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice."}

The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions."}

Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance."}

Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals.

By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures."}

The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau.

In this context, the present work considers the derivation of linear and quadratic Casimir operators corresponding to representations of the Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT) group associated with a five-dimensional spacetime of signature (1,4). This LCT group, which emerges naturally as the symmetry group of the relativistic quantum phase space, is isomorphic to the symplectic group Sp(2,8). The latter notably contains the de Sitter group SO(1,4) as a subgroup. This geometric setting provides a unified framework for extending the Standard Model of particle physics while incorporating cosmological features. Previous studies have shown that the LCT group admits both fermionic-like and bosonic-like representations. Within this framework, a novel classification of quarks and leptons, including sterile neutrinos, has also been proposed. In this work, we present a systematic derivation of the linear and quadratic Casimir operators associated with these representations, motivated by their fundamental role in the characterization of symmetry groups in physics. The construction is based on the relations between the LCT group and the pseudo-unitary group U(1,4). Three linears and three quadratics Casimir operators are identified: two corresponding to the fermionic-like representation, two to the bosonic-like representation, and two hybrid operators linking the two representations.

In the case of dissipative quantum evolution the steady-state density matrix is converged to a quantum strange attractor being similar to the classical one. It is shown that depending on the dissipation strength there is a regime when the eigenstates of density matrix are localized at a strong or moderate dissipation. At a weak dissipation the eigenstates are argued to be delocalized being linked to the Ehrenfest explosion of quantum wave packet. This phenomenon is related with the Lyapunov exponent and Ehrenfest time for the quantum strange attractor.

Traditional methods often fall short, relying on static and largely qualitative models that do not scale with system complexity and fail to capture systemic interdependencies. In this work, we introduce a novel quantitative approach to cyber risk assessment based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), a formulation compatible with both classical computing and quantum annealing. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic 255-nodes layered infrastructure, showing how risk spreads in non-trivial patterns that are difficult to identify through visual inspection alone. To assess scalability, we further conduct extensive experiments on networks up to 1000 nodes comparing classical, quantum, and hybrid classical-quantum workflows. Our results reveal that although quantum annealing produces solutions comparable to classical heuristics, its potential advantages are significantly hindered by the embedding overhead required to map the densely connected cyber-risk QUBO onto the limited connectivity of current quantum hardware. By contrast, hybrid quantum-classical solvers avoid this bottleneck and therefore emerge as a promising option, combining competitive scaling with an improved ability to explore the solution space and identify more stable risk configurations. Overall, this work delivers two main advances. First, we present a rigorous, tunable, and generalizable mathematical model for cyber risk that can be adapted to diverse infrastructures and domains through flexible parameterization.

The proposed method constructs a qubit-efficient image representation by first applying a cartographic generalization algorithm to a classical edge-extracted input image, yielding a highly optimized sparse-dot based geometric description. While ensuring the structural integrity of the image, this sparse representation is then embedded into the atomic configuration of Aquila (QuEra Computing Inc.), modeled through the Bloqade simulation software stack. By encoding visual information through physical atom placement rather than digital basis-state coding, the approach avoids the costly state-preparation overhead inherent to digital quantum image processing circuits. Additionally, pruning sparse dot images, akin to map feature reduction, compresses representations without fidelity loss, thereby substantially reducing qubit requirements when implemented on an analog neutral-atom quantum device. The resulting quantum-native images have been successfully evaluated through matching tasks against an image database, thus illustrating the feasibility of this approach for image matching applications. Since sparse-dot image representations enable seamless generation of synthetic datasets, this work constitutes an initial step towards fully quantum-native machine-learning pipelines for visual data and highlights the potential of scalable analog quantum computing to enable resource-efficient alternatives to energy-intensive classical AI-based image processing frameworks."}

However, problems of practical relevance typically have more variables than current or foreseeable quantum computers have qubits. Here we introduce a divide and conquer approach that partitions the optimization problem into subgraphs that can be represented on smaller quantum processors. We then find all states of the subgraphs that can possibly be part of the solution to the entire problem by determining the cost or energy ranges in which the local subgraph energies of these states must be contained. This allows us to reduce the problem by only considering the subspace spanned by these states. We then recombine the system using a binary encoding for each subgraph with a local energy ordering. This process can be iterated until no further reduction is possible. We also find that the number of necessary qubits can be reduced further when only retaining states in a fraction of the relevant energy range at very little expense in terms of approximation ratio to the global ground state. In numerical simulations, we find that our approach allows us to solve combinatorial optimization problems on weighted random 3-regular graphs with $|\\mathcal{V}|=40$ discrete variables on $\\sim |\\mathcal{V}| / 4$ qubits while retaining a possible approximation ratio of $\\sim99.9\\%$.

Here, we present a novel method that significantly extends the conceptual underpinning of these discrete-mode models, promoting them to a systematic treatment. We develop an ansatz which allows to quantize the resonator's resonances with position-resolved discrete modes, thus naturally incorporating losses in the formalism.

Small, near-term quantum processors are now available, but existing work rarely shows whether quantum components can improve end-to-end detection under these unstable, resource constrained conditions rather than just adding complexity. We address this gap with a hybrid architecture that uses a compact multilayer perceptron to compress security data and then routes a few features to 2-4 qubit quantum heads implemented as quantum support vector machines and variational circuits. Under matched preprocessing and training budgets, we benchmark these hybrids against tuned classical baselines on two security tasks, network intrusion detection on NSL-KDD and spam filtering on Ling-Spam datasets, and then deploy the best 4-qubit quantum SVM to an IBM Quantum device with noise-aware execution (readout mitigation and dynamical decoupling). Across both datasets, shallow quantum heads consistently match, and on difficult near-boundary cases modestly reduce, missed attacks and false alarms relative to classical models using the same features. Hardware results track simulator behavior closely enough that the remaining gap is dominated by device noise rather than model design. Taken together, the study shows that even on small, noisy chips, carefully engineered quantum components can already function as competitive, budget-aware elements in practical threat detection pipelines."}

Recently, it was shown that quantum nonlocality can be certified even under a simultaneous arbitrary (but not full) relaxation of the assumptions of Measurement Independence (MI) and Parameter Independence (PI), using states of local dimension $d = poly((1-ε)^{-1})$ for an $ε\\in [0,1)$-relaxation. Here, we derive three results strengthening the state-of-art. Firstly, we show that states of constant local dimension $d$ are already sufficient to certify quantum nonlocality under arbitrary MI and PI relaxation, albeit in a non-robust manner. Secondly, and as a theoretical paradigm to derive the above, we introduce the notion of \\textit{measurement-dependent parameter-dependent locality} as the set of input-output behaviors under simultaneous relaxations of measurement and parameter independence. We provide a rigorous characterisation of the vertices of the polytope of joint input-output behaviors that obey a $μ$-relaxation of MI and $ε$-relaxation of PI. We highlight a relation between nonlocality certification under PI relaxation and that under detection inefficiencies by pointing out alternative extremal correlations to the Eberhard correlations that also allow to achieve detection efficiency of $η= 2/3$ in the two-input scenario. Finally, we study the implication of the relaxed assumptions for device-independent randomness certification. We analytically derive the quantum guessing probability for one player's outcomes in the CHSH Bell test, as a function of the noise in the test as well as of a leakage of an average amount of $I(X:B) < 1$ bits of input information per measurement round."}

The distribution of non-classical and non-local correlations between the individual subsystems in an MDQN is of fundamental interest for many quantum protocols. Interestingly in an MDQN, the inseparability of two subsystems underlying entanglement can occur both between multiple distinct photons as well as between individual degrees of freedom associated with a single photon. In this work, we investigate the entanglement transfer enabled by the interplay of both entanglement between two distinct photons as well as inseparability between multiple degrees of freedom. For this purpose, we subject one photon of a polarization entangled two-photon pair to a discrete-time quantum walk introducing the position subsystem of the quantum walk as a third subsystem with qudit encoding.

For any finite-query protocol -- including arbitrary accessible ancillas, intermediate measurements, adaptivity, and general CPTP processing between queries -- the induced output state on the accessible registers depends on the memory state only through its diagonal in the truth-table basis. Equivalently, read-only access factors through dephasing (pinching) in that basis; coherences between distinct truth tables are operationally invisible.\n  Consequently, every memory-hypothesis testing task reduces to a standard state-discrimination problem on the accessible registers, and the minimum-error optimal measurement is characterized by Helstrom theory.

In this work, we apply QRC within a hybrid quantum classical framework for image denoising.

To prepare the input, images are first compressed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), reducing their dimensionality to match the size of the atom array. Each feature vector is encoded into local detuning parameters of a time-dependent Hamiltonian governing the Rydberg system. As the system evolves, it generates nonlinear embeddings through the measurement of observables across multiple time steps. These temporal embeddings capture complex correlations, which are fed into a classical neural network to reconstruct the denoised images. To evaluate performance, we compare this QRC-assisted model against a baseline architecture consisting of PCA followed by a dense neural network, trained under identical conditions. Our results show that the QRC-based approach achieves improved image sharpness and similar structural recovery compared to the PCA-based model. We demonstrate the practical viability of this framework through experiments on QuEra's Aquila neutral-atom processor, leveraging its programmable atom arrays to physically realize the reservoir dynamics."}

Experiments performed on QuEra's Aquila quantum processor are benchmarked against large-scale coherent emulations using the Juelich Quantum Annealing Simulator (JUQAS), enabling the controlled inclusion of realistic hardware imperfections. In the ideal coherent limit, a tunable longitudinal field induces confinement of domain-wall excitations into mesonic bound states, leading to a progressive truncation of the correlation light cone. When experimentally relevant inhomogeneities and fluctuations are included, correlations instead saturate at finite distance even in the nominally deconfined regime, revealing localization driven by emergent disorder. The close quantitative agreement between noisy emulations and experimental data allows us to attribute the observed saturation to specific hardware error channels and to identify the dominant contribution. Our results establish a practical framework for diagnosing and modeling error-induced localization in Rydberg quantum processors, while demonstrating that confinement remains a robust and programmable mechanism for engineering non-ergodic dynamics on near-term quantum hardware."}

Crucially, this chaos-controlled inversion is not tied to a particular notion of subsystems, appearing both in single-wave settings and in genuine many-body settings. From the quantum-chaos perspective, conventional diagnostics based on avoided-crossing phenomenology and eigenmode delocalization are insufficient; eigenfunction entanglement and basis coherence provide the missing discriminants. Using two wave-chaotic billiards and a tilted-field Ising chain, we track the information-theoretic response of eigenstates across localized hybridization windows. Even when avoided-crossing phenomenology and delocalization are comparable, the entanglement and coherence responses invert between soft- and strong-chaos regimes. In the Ising chain, a single microscopic knob, the global field tilt, toggles between the two operating modes and reveals a trade-off in which off-diagonal correlations grow as diagonal populations dip.

Built from the non-commutative fundamental group and its braid representation, topological chirality acts as a singularity selector: clockwise EP loops occupy a homotopy class that avoids EPs, whereas counter-clockwise mirrors are equivalent only if they cross the EPs themselves. We confirm this binary rule in an optical microcavity and a non-Hermitian topological band. The same two-sheeted topology governs EP pairs in spin systems, photonic crystals and hybrid light-matter structures, where EP encirclements have already been demonstrated, so the framework transfers without alteration and confirms its experimental viability. Our findings lay the cornerstone for interpreting loop-sensitive observables such as spectral vorticity, the complex Berry phase and the non-Abelian holonomy. Finally, a gluing-of-planes construction extends the invariant to an n-sheeted surface hosting 2m EPs, unifying higher-order EP pairs."}

We show that a single model pretrained on low-complexity states can be directly applied to characterize states of higher complexity. With limited fine-tuning, the model adapts to downstream tasks such as predicting quantum fidelity and Wigner negativity over a broad class of experimentally relevant states, including strongly non-Gaussian Schrödinger cat states, multimode systems with up to ten modes, and highly squeezed states with squeezing levels up to 10.4dB. Our results establish a unified framework for characterizing optical quantum states from limited measurement data, enabling efficient certification of quantum states relevant to optical quantum information computation, communication and metrology."}

On the other, we analyse the joint probability distributions associated with sequential measurements of the walker's position, assessing their violation of the classical Kolmogorov consistency conditions via a dedicated quantifier $\\bar{K}(t)$. We demonstrate a quadratic short-time scaling of $\\bar{K}(t)$, which differs from the known linear scaling of $D_{\\mathrm{QC}}(t)$, but, as the latter, is fully determined by the degree of the initially occupied node and is independent of the global graph topology.

However, many quantum algorithms require deep quantum circuits, which are challenging to implement on current noisy devices. To address this limitation, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been actively developed, enabling practical quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Among them, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) stands out as a leading approach for solving problems in quantum chemistry, many-body physics, and even integer factorization. The VQE algorithm can be implemented on various quantum hardware platforms, including photonic systems, quantum dots, trapped ions, neutral atoms, and superconducting circuits. In particular, photonic platforms offer several advantages: they operate at room temperature, exhibit low decoherence, and support multiple degrees of freedom, making them suitable for scalable, high-dimensional quantum computation. Here we present methodologies for realizing VQE on photonic systems, highlighting their potential for practical quantum computing. We first provide a theoretical overview of the VQE framework, focusing on the procedure for variationally estimating ground state energies. We then explore how photonic systems can implement these processes, showing that a wide variety of problems can be addressed using either multiple qubit states or a single qudit state."}

Here, we present a Sagnac-loop integrated system (SLIS) that, for the first time, combines ring-based quantum key distribution (QKD) with fiber-based weak measurement (WM) enhanced sensing and disturbance localization capabilities. In the event of communication interruption due to external disturbances, the SLIS seamlessly switches to perception system, employing interference measurement and WM techniques to monitor channel disturbances. By integrating null-frequencies localization (NFL) mode, the system precisely determines the disturbance location, enabling rapid identification of security vulnerabilities along the link. Experimental results demonstrate that, over a 30 km Sagnac loop channel, the SLIS achieves a raw key generation rate of 22.4 kbps with stable operation and clear scalability toward network expansion. In terms of perception performance, the SLIS exhibits strong capability for both dynamic and quasi-static disturbances. For dynamic perturbations, the system detects transient impacts and PZT-driven frequency variations down to 100 Hz, and enables long-distance localization via NFL alignment, with improved localization performance as the disturbance position moves farther away along the loop. For quasi-static disturbances, gravitational changes as small as 100 g are resolved, corresponding to a time-delay variation of 9.81 as. This work provides a novel technical pathway toward self-diagnosing, robust quantum networks through integrated communication and sensing functionalities."}

Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance.

The model is designed to support both baseline planning and disruption management under increased passenger demand. Using a graph-hypergraph representation of trips and single or coupled EMU movements, we first solve the problem with a classical ILP solver. We then derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) reformulation - which is frequently used as the input for quantum optimization - and evaluate its solution by quantum annealing on D-Wave Advantage systems and by the classical quantum-inspired VeloxQ solver. Computational experiments on real-world instances from the Silesian network, with up to 404 train trips and 11 EMU types, show that the ILP approach can obtain high-quality daily circulation plans within at most about 40 minutes, whereas current quantum and quantum-inspired solvers are restricted to substantially smaller sub-instances (up to 51 and 78 train trips, respectively) due to embedding and QUBO size limitations. These results quantify the present frontier of QUBO-based methods for rolling stock circulation and point towards hybrid decision-support architectures in which quantum or quantum-inspired optimizers address only local subproblems within a broader classical planning framework."}

This tension has long obstructed the formulation of a relativistic master equation: standard Markovian approximations either break Lorentz covariance, trigger catastrophic vacuum heating, or depend arbitrarily on the observer's foliation. In this work, we derive a Lorentz-invariant description of irreversibility for quantum fields. We take an approach that explicitly models the measurements required to observe irreversible dynamics. Instead of evolving the system along an abstract geometric time parameter, we anchor the dynamics to a physical, relational scalar clock field. Using a relational Tomonaga-Schwinger framework, we derive a local, non-Markovian master equation that is manifestly covariant and completely positive. We show that the finite resolution of the physical clock acts as a covariant regulator, preventing the vacuum instability that plagues white-noise models. This framework demonstrates that a consistent relativistic theory of decay exists, provided the reference frame is treated as a dynamical quantum resource rather than a gauge choice. In a gravitating context, the resulting dynamics is described by a hybrid classical-quantum (CQ) evolution that remains completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP)."}

However, both require repeated quantum circuit executions for each Krylov subspace and for every new Hamiltonian, posing a major bottleneck under noisy hardware constraints. We introduce Generative Krylov Subspace Representations (GenKSR), a framework that learns a classical generative representation of the entire Krylov diagonalization process. To enable effective modeling of quantum systems, GenKSR leverages a conditional generative model framework. We investigate two representative backbone architectures, the standard Transformer and the Mamba state-space model. By learning the distribution of measurement outcomes conditioned on Hamiltonian parameters and evolution time, GenKSR generates Krylov subspace samples for unseen Hamiltonians and for larger subspace dimensions than those used in training. This enables full energy reconstruction purely from the classical model, without additional quantum experiments. We validate our approach through simulations of 15-qubit 1D and 16-qubit 2D Heisenberg models, as well as a hardware experiment on a 20-qubit XXZ chain executed on an IBM quantum processor. Our model successfully learns the distribution from experimental data and generates a high-fidelity representation of the quantum process.

This models the phase fluctuations which remain even when the mean phase is controlled. We aim to determine whether these phase-noisy input states still form a computationally difficult problem. To do this, we use Matrix Product Operators to model the system, a technique recently used to model boson sampling scenarios. Our investigation finds that the Entanglement entropy grows linearly with the number of input states even for noisy input states.

We show that the interference between these two coupling channels induces strong non-Markovian feedback between populations and coherences, leading to coherence trapping and enhanced thermal sensitivity.

However, it typically incurs a measurement overhead exponential in the number of cut locations, and it remains open whether this scaling is fundamentally unavoidable. In conventional circuit-cutting approaches based on the quasiprobability decomposition (QPD), for example, rescaling factors lead to an exponential dependence on the number of cuts. In this work, we show that such an exponential scaling is not universal: it can be circumvented for tree-structured quantum circuits via concatenated quantum tomography protocols. We first consider estimating the expectation value of an observable within additive error $ε$ for a tree-structured circuit with tree depth 1 (two layers), maximum branching factor $R$, and bond dimension at most $d$ on each edge. Our approach uses quantum tomography to construct, for each cut edge, a local decomposition that eliminates the rescaling factors in conventional QPD, instead introducing a controllable bias set by the tomography sample size. After cutting $R$ edges, we show that $\\mathcal{O}(d^3R^3\\ln(dR)/ε^2)$ total measurements suffice, including tomography cost. Next, we extend the tree-depth-1 case to general trees of depth $L\\geq2$, and give an algorithm whose total measurement cost $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^3K^{5}/ε^2)$ scales polynomially with the number of cuts for complete $R$-ary trees. Finally, we perform an information-theoretic analysis to show that, in a comparable tree-depth-1 setting, conventional QPD-based wire-cutting methods require at least $Ω((d+1)^R/ε^2)$ measurements. This exponential separation highlights the significance of tomography-based construction for reducing measurement overhead in hybrid quantum-classical computations."}

In particular, recent works have generalized this concept to microscopy setups, but the sensitivity to optical path differences constrains its application to samples with thickness variation typically below a few micrometers if tracking changes in the coincidences at a fixed delay. Extending the concept to polarization microscopy and circumventing this limitation, this manuscript explores the use of a narrowband photon pair source with coherence length >1 mm to broaden the HOM dip. Thus, realistic sample-thickness variations introduce negligible temporal distinguishability, and changes in coincidence rate at the dip centre are then dominated by sample-induced polarization effects. To compute the polarization rotation, we develop a statistical model for the interferometer, derive the Fisher information, and establish a maximum-likelihood estimator for the local fast-axis angle. Recording dip and baseline frames at each sample position via raster scanning, the experimental results validate the framework, agreeing with classical polarized-intensity images while demonstrating operation at a maximum-precision regime and insensitiveness to layer thickness. Overall, the approach enclosed provides a quantum-based quantitative imaging of birefringent structures, which can motivate further advantageous applications, including enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and lower damage imaging of photosensitive samples."}

Their non-stabilizerness provides the additional resource required to overcome the constraints of stabilizer codes, as formalized by the Eastin-Knill theorem, while still permitting fault-tolerant distillation. Although numerous measures of magic have been introduced, not every state with nonzero magic has been shown to be distillable by a stabilizer code, and all currently known distillable states arise as special cases of Clifford-stabilizer states, defined as pure states uniquely stabilized by finite subgroups of the Clifford group. In this work, we develop a general framework for group-covariant functionals on the real manifold of Hermitian operators. We formalize the notions of $G$-stabilizer spaces, states, and codes for arbitrary finite subgroups $G \\subset \\mathrm{U}(\\mathcal{H})$, and introduce analytic families of $G$-covariant functionals. Our main theorem shows that any $G$-invariant pure state is an extremal point of a broad class of derived functionals, including symmetric, max-type, and Rényi-type functionals, provided the underlying family is $G$-covariant. This extremality holds for variations restricted to directions orthogonal to the stabilized subspace while preserving purity. Specializing to the Pauli and Clifford groups, our framework unifies the extremality structure of several canonical magic measures, including mana, stabilizer Rényi entropies, and stabilizer fidelity. In particular, Clifford-stabilizer states extremize these measures. We classify such states for qubits, qutrits, ququints, and two-qubit systems, identifying new candidates for magic distillation protocols.

The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau.

In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the \"modulated wiggle well,\" which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $μ$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moiré systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moiré systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moiré systems, including super-moiré with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moiré patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moiré, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moiré systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moiré systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures."}

Using a $j\\in\\{1/2,3/2,5/2\\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \\textit{p}- and \\textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j>1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center."}

The key idea is to employ interpolation method, such as the two-point Padé expansion, to interpolate the weak and strong coupling expansions of correlation function. We benchmark this many-body interpolation approach on two prototypical models: the lattice $φ^4$ field theory and the 2D Hubbard model. For the $φ^4$ theory, the resulting two point Padé approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Padé appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we offer a heuristic explanation for these convergence properties based on analytic function theory."}

Using Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the full Fermi-Hubbard model, we obtain their excitation spectra, entanglement profiles, and spin-spin correlations. We then construct optimized delocalized fermionic modes that act as emergent spins and show that their interactions are well described by a frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain. This effective description clarifies how spin degrees of freedom arise and interact in non-bipartite nanographene ladders, providing a compact and accurate representation of their correlated behavior."}

We derive an integral representation of the distribution function that works equally well for systems of any symmetry and for any type of coupling to the measuring device. From this integral representation we find explicit analytic expressions for the distribution function in the case of disordered metallic grains. We also compare the analytic results to large-scale numerical simulations and observe their perfect agreement."}

In the absence of static magnetic order, the spin excitation spectrum constitutes the crucial probe of QSL behavior, but its theoretical computation remains a serious challenge. Here we employ state-of-the-art tensor-network methods to obtain the full dynamical spectral function of the $J_1$-$J_2$ kagome Heisenberg model and benchmark our results by tracking their evolution across the magnetically ordered and QSL phases. Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials."}

In conventional thermodynamic trade-off relations, the quantities of interest are linear in the underlying probability distribution. Some important information-theoretic quantities, such as Rényi entropies, are nonlinear; however, such nonlinearities are generally more difficult to handle. Inspired by replica techniques used in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we construct Markovian dynamics of identical replicas and derive a lower bound on relative moments in terms of the dynamical activity. We apply our general result to two scenarios. First, for a random walker on a network, we derive an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the position distribution of the walker, which quantifies the extent of diffusion on the network. Remarkably, the bound is expressed solely in terms of escape rate from the initial node, and thus depends only on local information. Second, we consider trajectory observables in Markov processes and obtain an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the distribution of these observables, again in terms of the dynamical activity. This provides an entropic characterization of uncertainty that generalizes existing variance-based thermodynamic uncertainty relations."}

Through numerical simulations of two-particle dynamics and the symmetry analysis, we reveal the asymmetric transport with broken inversion symmetry and two dynamical symmetries in the expansion dynamics. The expansion of two-component anyons is dynamically symmetric under spatial inversion and component flip, when the sign of anyonic statistics phase or the signs of gauge flux and interaction are changed. In the non-interacting case, we show the dynamical suppression induced by both the statistics phase and gauge flux. In the interacting case, we demonstrate that both chiral and antichiral dynamics can be exhibited and tuned by the statistics phase and gauge flux. The dynamical phase regimes with respect to the chiral-antichiral dynamics are obtained. These findings highlight the rich dynamical phenomena arising from the interplay of anyonic exchange statistics, synthetic gauge fields, and interactions in multi-component anyons."}
