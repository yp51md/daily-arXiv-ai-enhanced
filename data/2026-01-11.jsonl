Advances in controlling ultra-cold quantum gases provide an ideal testbed for few-body physics theory. In this work, we study few-body systems consisting of two distinct species of non-relativistic fermions in one spatial dimension using both field theory and lattice methods. Particles of the same type do not interact with each other, but particles of different types can interact via an attractive contact interaction. We first study the dependence of the coupling of a contact interaction on the lattice spacing. Using this input, we extract two-, three-, and four-body ground state energies in the infinite length limit and benchmark them against the calculations from the continuum field theory. This work enables us to systematically study the effect of discretization and finite-length artifacts on few-body observables."}

Using tree tensor network simulations, we benchmark the performance of this quantum simulator through near- and far-from-equilibrium observables, showing excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory. Additionally, we introduce a method for \\textit{analog quantum error mitigation} that accounts for unwanted first-order tunneling processes, vastly improving agreement between quantum-simulator and ideal-gauge-theory results. Our findings pave the way towards realistic quantum simulators of $3+1$D lattice gauge theories that can probe regimes well beyond classical simulability."}

For mass ratios much greater than 1 we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the scattering length and the effective range of the dimer-wall collision both depend logarithmically on the mass ratio. For collision energies much greater than the binding energy, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum of the dimer and we find the constant of proportionality analytically, and we use a semiclassical analysis to approximately derive the ``angular distribution\" of the dissociated pair, where the ``angle\" $θ$ depends on the ratio of the velocities of the two outgoing unbound particles."}

The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\\pm \\ell \\hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid."}

When the directed interactions are totally uncorrelated, sufficiently strong and non-linear, many of these systems exhibit a chaotic attractor characterized by a positive maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). On the contrary, when the interactions are completely symmetric, the dynamics takes the form of a gradient descent on a carefully defined cost function, and it exhibits slow dynamics and aging. In this work, we consider the intermediate case in which the interactions are partially symmetric, with a parameter α tuning the degree of non-reciprocity. We show that for any value of α for which the corresponding system has non-reciprocal interactions, the dynamics lands on a chaotic attractor. Correspondingly, the MLE is a non-monotonous function of the degree of non-reciprocity. This implies that conservative forcing deriving from the gradient field of a rough energy landscape can make the system more chaotic."}

Using very-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering on a single crystal of FeF$_2$, we show that the dominant source of magnon splitting is in fact the long-range dipolar interaction rather than altermagnetic exchange terms. At momenta where the dipolar splitting vanishes, we observe additional broadening due to altermagnetic chiral splitting and estimate this splitting to be $\\sim$35 $μ$eV. Polarized measurements further reveal that, where dipolar splitting is present, the chiral magnon modes become mixed and the resulting modes are predominantly linearly polarized, with at most a small chiral component. These findings highlight the significant effect of dipolar interactions on magnon chirality, particularly when altermagnetic interactions are weak."}

Starting from the Lennard-Jones potential, we evaluate the second virial coefficient to infer the virial expansion of the equation of state and recover the van der Waals equation using only its leading correction. The corresponding partition function allows us to obtain all thermodynamic potentials for both monoatomic and diatomic fluids in a transparent and instructive manner.\n  Building on this framework, we formulate and solve analytically the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the vicinity of the critical point, obtaining the liquid-vapor coexistence curve in closed form. This approach not only clarifies the microscopic origin of van der Waals thermodynamics but also complements-and in several aspects improves upon-traditional treatments that rely heavily on numerical methods or heuristic arguments.\n  In addition, because the van der Waals equation naturally predicts the liquid-vapor equilibrium, the existence of critical points, and the functional form of the saturation curve of the pressure as a function of temperature, it provides an analytically tractable framework for studying a 150-year-old problem that has historically been addressed using graphical constructions or numerical solutions. As such, the formulation developed here offers a coherent, accessible, and conceptually unified route for students and instructors to understand phase coexistence in simple fluids from first principles."}

Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays."}

By analyzing these dynamics on a single-curve, single-pixel basis, we extract time-local mechanical information without external broadband excitation or multi-pass imaging. We develop a state-dependent single-mode harmonic oscillator model that captures snap-in excitation, hydration-mediated dissipation, and contact stiffness during fast force mapping. Experimental analysis of high-bandwidth force-curve data and numerical simulations demonstrate that multiple dynamically distinct interaction regimes occur within a single FC. Accessing these transient dynamics enables high-throughput, high-resolution mapping of mechanical contrast and reveals heterogeneous and non-repeatable behaviors that are lost under conventional averaging or with conventional detection schemes with higher noise floors."}

Although a perfectly flat band cannot exist in a continuous system, a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in a Zeeman lattice can realize the quasi-flat lowest band with an extremely narrow bandwidth. In such a quasi flat band, half vortex solitons become confined within a single lattice cell, enabling the formation of arrays of coupled half vortex solitons arranged of various spatial geometries. In this work, we study the existence and stability of these lattices within the framework of the two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that, near the quasi-flat band, half-vortex solitons and their arrays can be excited with a nearly negligible number of atoms and are constrained by their local symmetries, which are isomorphic to a dihedral group of order 8. This allows observation of the respective field patterns in the nearly linear regime where they exhibit enhanced stability. The constructed lattices may have diverse geometric profiles, and in particular create a composite super-half-vortex soliton with nonlinear symmetry breaking."}

In this scheme, QEC has two effects: First, it sacrifices part of the signal $ε$ by recording a reduced, stochastic, logical phase $φ_L = \\mathcal{O}(ε^3)$. Second, it corrects the physical noise and extends the (logical) coherence time for signal acquisition. For rare signals occurring at random times in the presence of local Markovian noise, we explicitly demonstrate an improved sensitivity of our approach over more conventional sensing strategies."}

Here, we explore nonequilibrium phase transitions in a dissipative Rydberg system driven by a microwave (MW) field and demonstrate their critical sensitivity to high-precision MW sensing. Distinct dynamical regimes are identified, including monostable, bistable, and oscillatory phases under mean-field coupling. Unlike single-particle detection--where the beating signal decays linearly with MW field strength--the time crystalline phase exhibits high sensitivity to MW perturbations, with rapid, discontinuous frequency switching near the monostable-oscillatory boundary. The abrupt transition is rooted in spontaneous symmetry breaking in time and is fundamentally insensitive to the background noise. On this basis, a minimum detectable MW field strength on the order of 1nV/cm is achieved by leveraging this sensitivity. Our results establish a framework for controlling time crystalline phases with external fields and advance MW sensing through many-body effects."}

By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols.

Using geometric bounds on entropy production, we derive general limits on the energy-delay-deficiency product (EDDP), a stochastic generalization of the traditional energy-delay product (EDP). While these limits can in principle be saturated, the corresponding optimal driving protocols require full knowledge of the final equilibrium distribution, i.e., the solution itself.

This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime.

Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales.

Theoretical and experimental investigations are actively progressing to provide the capability of efficient switching and precise control of the Néel vector, which is crucial for the intended practical applications of antiferromagnets. Recently, a time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory has been successfully developed to study the sublattice magnetization switching in anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets [K.

Furthermore, this article aims to support the findings of the Schwinger boson approach. We show that the results of both approaches are consistent at short time scales, with only about 12.5 $\\%$ deviations. The consistency of the outcomes obtained through this alternative exact approach demonstrates that the time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory is a versatile framework to capture the essentials of the switching process in quantum antiferromagnets.

Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner\" solution), valid for not too large $m$. We demonstrate and verify this method on three examples of reactions which are also solvable without approximations."}

Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface.

Using a density-matrix formulation that incorporates both minimal coupling and spin-Zeeman interactions, we derive the electronic equations of motion in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field and uncover a previously unexplored orbital contribution to the wavepacket velocity.

The difference is such that the independent-electron approximation remains valid for spin transfer when injected spin currents are completely incoherent. However, in partially coherent systems, like superconductor/ferromagnet junctions, coherent spin-singlet currents can directly convert into equal-spin triplet currents in generic ferromagnets, without requiring magnetic inhomogeniety or spin-orbit coupling."}

Here, we develop a theory encapsulating the notion of a cascade of lightcones seeded by sequences of scattering of weakly interacting harmonic modes as witnessed by a suitably defined chaos diagnostic (classical decorrelator) that measures the spatiotemporal profile of many-body chaos. Our numerics deals with the concrete case of a classical Heisenberg chain, for either sign of the interaction, at low temperatures where the short-time dynamics are well captured in terms of non-interacting spin waves. To model low-temperature dynamics, we use ensembles of initial states with randomly embedded point defects in an otherwise ordered background, which provides a controlled setting for studying the scattering events. The decorrelator exhibits a short-time integrable regime followed by an intermediate `scarred' regime of the cascade of lightcones in progress; these then overlap, leading to an avalanche of scattering events which finally yields the standard long-time signature of many-body chaos."}

A single quantum dot in a site-selected nanowire waveguide is a promising candidate for realizing such sources.

A common approach for enhancing the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum dot-based entangled photon sources is to implement a broadband optical cavity. Achieving a high-Purcell cavity while retaining the advantages of the nanowire, such as directional emission, a broad operational bandwidth, and high light extraction efficiency, has been a significant challenge. Here, we propose a nanowire cavity based on quasi-bound states in the continuum formed by the strong coupling of two resonant optical modes. We numerically predict this design to support a cavity mode with 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of $\\sim$17. This cavity mode enables a directional far-field emission profile (88% overlap with a Gaussian) with a light extraction efficiency of $\\sim$74%. Our solution opens up a route for generating entangled photon pairs with enhanced extraction efficiency and single-photon indistinguishability for the practical realization of quantum networks."}

Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding. Our framework explains how the apparent bulk-edge correspondence failures in models like the non-Hermitian SSH chain instead reflect the systematic inability of the eigenvalue spectrum to detect certain eigenstates in systems with a skin-effect.

However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments."}

Using circularly polarized excitation in the presence of an external magnetic field, we observe a pronounced modulation of the PL lifetime that depends on the magnetic field magnitude and geometry.

Quantum technology can facilitate secure communication for cryptographic applications, combining QKD with one-time-pad (OTP) encryption. In order to ensure the continuous operation of QKD in real-world networks, efforts have been concentrated on optimizing the use of components and effective QKD protocols to improve secret key rates and increase the transmission between multiple users. Generally, in experimental implementations, the secret key rates are limited by single-photon detectors, which are used at the receivers of QKD and create a bottleneck due to their limited detection rates (detectors with low detection efficiency and high detector dead-time). We experimentally show that secret key rates can be increased by combining the time-bin information of two such detectors on the data line of the receiver for the coherent-one-way (COW) QKD protocol with a minimal increase in quantum bit error rate (QBER, the proportion of erroneous bits). Further, we implement a point-to-multipoint COW QKD protocol, introducing an additional receiver module. The three users (one transmitter and two receivers) share the secret key in post-processing, relying on OTP encryption. Typically, the dual-receiver extension can improve the combined secret key rates of the system; however, one has to optimise the experimental parameters to achieve this within security margins.

There must therefore be a, possibly generic, crossover between these very different regimes. Here, we develop a theory encapsulating the notion of a cascade of lightcones seeded by sequences of scattering of weakly interacting harmonic modes as witnessed by a suitably defined chaos diagnostic (classical decorrelator) that measures the spatiotemporal profile of many-body chaos. Our numerics deals with the concrete case of a classical Heisenberg chain, for either sign of the interaction, at low temperatures where the short-time dynamics are well captured in terms of non-interacting spin waves. To model low-temperature dynamics, we use ensembles of initial states with randomly embedded point defects in an otherwise ordered background, which provides a controlled setting for studying the scattering events. The decorrelator exhibits a short-time integrable regime followed by an intermediate `scarred' regime of the cascade of lightcones in progress; these then overlap, leading to an avalanche of scattering events which finally yields the standard long-time signature of many-body chaos."}

Hardy's paradox, or Hardy-type nonlocality, provides a way to investigate nonlocality for entangled states of particles without using inequalities. Previous studies of Hardy's nonlocality have mostly focused on the fully entangled systems, while other entanglement configurations remain less explored. In this work, the system under investigation consists of four particles arranged in a cyclic entanglement configuration, where each particle forms entangled pairs with two neighbors, while non-neighboring particles remain unentangled. We found that this entanglement structure offers a larger set of conditions that lead to the contradiction with the LHV model, compared to the fully entangled systems. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of multiple excluded states and correlations, in which the measurement result of a particle only influences the result of its paired partners. We implement quantum circuits compatible with the cyclic entanglement structure, and through simulation, the correlation patterns and the states of interest are identified. We further execute the proposed circuits on IBM Brisbane, a practical backend; however, the results show considerable deviations from the simulation counterparts."}

Standard regulators typically impose such suppressions by hand (e.g. cutoffs, higher-derivative terms, heat-kernel smearing, lattice discretizations), while here we show that closely related smooth filters can arise as the conditional map produced by interference in a coherently controlled, postselected superposition of evolutions. A successful postselection implements a single heralded operator that is a coherent linear combination of time-evolution operators. For a Gaussian superposition of time translations in quantum mechanics, the postselected step is $V_{σ,Δt}=e^{-iHΔt}\\,e^{-\\frac12σ^2Δt^2H^2}$, i.e.\\ the desired unitary step multiplied by a Gaussian energy filter suppressing energies above order $1/(σΔt)$. This renders short-time kernels in time-sliced path-integral approximations well behaved for singular potentials, while the target unitary dynamics is recovered as $σ\\to0$ and (for fixed $σ$) also as $Δt\\to0$ at fixed $t$. In scalar QFT, a local Gaussian smearing of the quartic coupling induces a positive $(σ^2/2)φ^8$ term in the Euclidean action, providing a symmetry-compatible large-field stabilizer; it is naturally viewed as an irrelevant operator whose effects can be renormalized at fixed $σ$ (together with a conventional UV regulator) and removed by taking $σ\\to0$.

Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1>0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout.

We present a framework based solely on unitary dynamics to design quantum simulations for thermal states with respect to Hamiltonians that include non-native interactions, suitable for both present-day digital and analogue devices. By classical means, our method finds the control sequence to reach a target thermal state for system sizes well out of reach of state-vector or density-matrix control methods, even though quantum hardware is required to explicitly simulate the thermal state dynamics.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Pauli Composer Accelerator (PACOX), the first dedicated FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation. PACOX employs a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation. Based on this formulation, we design a parallel and pipelined processing element (PE) cluster architecture that efficiently exploits data-level parallelism on FPGA. Experimental results on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA show that PACOX operates at 250 MHz with a dynamic power consumption of 0.33 W, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. For Pauli strings of up to 19 qubits, PACOX achieves speedups of up to 100 times compared with state-of-the-art CPU-based methods, while requiring significantly less memory and achieving a much lower power-delay product. These results demonstrate that PACOX delivers high computational speed with superior energy efficiency for Pauli-based workloads in hybrid quantum-classical systems."}

We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates.

In quantum chaotic systems, coherent errors arising from imperfect Hamiltonian control and incoherent errors induced by coupling to the environment are both exponentially amplified during time evolution due to information scrambling. A fundamental question is how these two classes of errors imprint distinct signatures on the emergent irreversibility of many-body dynamics. In this Letter, we address this question by investigating multi-round time-reversed dynamics in the presence of both coherent and incoherent errors. By applying scramblon theory, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Loschmidt echo over different rounds of time-reversed evolution. For incoherent errors, the error accumulates linearly with the number of rounds, whereas coherent errors exhibit a crossover from quadratic to linear accumulation. These predictions are explicitly verified using the solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for characterizing and calibrating coherent and incoherent errors in reversed dynamics, with particular relevance to nuclear magnetic resonance systems."}

Here, we experimentally demonstrate junction readout, a simple readout architecture that realizes a strong qubit-resonator cross-Kerr interaction without relying on a transverse coupling. This interaction is achieved by coupling a transmon qubit to its readout resonator through both a capacitance and a Josephson junction. By varying the qubit frequency, we show that this hybrid coupling provides intrinsic Purcell protection and enhanced resilience to MIST, enabling readout at high photon numbers. While junction readout is compatible with conventional linear measurement, in this work we exploit the nonlinear coupling to intentionally engineer a large Kerr nonlinearity in the resonator, enabling bifurcation-based readout. Using this approach, we achieve a 99.4 % assignment fidelity with a 68 ns integration time and a 98.4 % QND fidelity without an external Purcell filter or a near-quantum-limited amplifier.

However, broad hyperfine-split spin transitions of the ensemble pose challenges for quantum sensing with conventional resonant excitation due to limited spectral coverage. While isotopically enriched hBN using $^{10}$B and $^{15}$N isotopes (h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N) exhibits sharper spectral features, significant inhomogeneous broadening persists. We demonstrate that, implemented via frequency modulation on an FPGA, a frequency-ramped microwave pulse achieves around 4-fold greater $|0\\rangle\\rightarrow|-1\\rangle$ spin-state population transfer and thus contrast than resonant microwave excitation and thus 16-fold shorter measurement time for spin relaxation based quantum sensing. Quantum dynamics simulations reveal that an effective two-state Landau-Zener model captures the complex relationship between population inversion and pulse length with relaxations incorporated. Our approach is robust and valuable for quantum relaxometry with spin defects in hBN in noisy environments."}

Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator. This hints toward a type of quantum advantage for quantum generative modeling."}

In contrast, the \\textit{Mpemba effect}, the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter states relax faster than colder ones, has mostly been viewed as a thermodynamic anomaly. Here, we bridge this gap by proving that Mpemba-type inversions generically yield a finite-time enhancement of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation, thereby converting an anomalous relaxation effect into a concrete metrological resource. Through explicit analyses of two-level and $Λ$-level probes coupled to bosonic baths, we show that nonequilibrium initializations can transiently outperform both equilibrium strategies and colder states, realizing a \\emph{metrological Mpemba effect}. Our results establish anomalous relaxation as a general design principle for nonequilibrium quantum thermometry, enabling ultrafast and nanoscale sensing protocols that exploit, rather than avoid, transient dynamics."}

In this work, we present a technique for extracting a smooth positive function encoded in the amplitudes of a quantum state, which achieves the Heisenberg limit scaling. We improve upon previous methods by allowing higher dimensional functions, by significantly reducing the quantum complexity with respect to the number of qubits encoding the function, and by removing the dependency on the minimum of the function using preconditioning. Our technique works by sampling the cumulative distribution of the given function, fitting it with Chebyshev polynomials, and subsequently extracting a representation of the whole encoded function.

In the present work, we present a unitary, scalable, distance-preserving encoding scheme for preparing Pauli eigenstates in surface codes. Unlike previous unitary approaches whose fault-distance remains constant with increasing code distance, our scheme ensures that the protection offered by the code is preserved during state preparation. Building on strategies discovered by reinforcement learning for the surface-17 code, we generalize the construction to arbitrary code distances and both rotated and unrotated surface codes. The proposed encoding relies only on geometrically local gates, and is therefore fully compatible with planar 2D qubit connectivity, and it achieves circuit depth scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(d)$, consistent with fundamental entanglement-generation bounds. We design explicit stabilizer-expanding circuits with and without ancilla-mediated connectivity and analyze their error-propagation behavior. Numerical simulations under depolarizing noise show that our unitary encoding without ancillas outperforms standard stabilizer-measurement-based schemes, reducing logical error rates by up to an order of magnitude. These results make the scheme particularly relevant for platforms such as trapped ions and neutral atoms, where measurements are costly relative to gates and idling noise is considerably weaker than gate noise. Our work bridges the gap between measurement-based and unitary encodings of surface-code states and opens new directions for distance-preserving state preparation in fault-tolerant quantum computation."}

In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources."}

Non-signalling state assemblages, and the fact that they can always be simultaneously purified, turned out to be the key element to restrict the simplest bipartite communication scenario, the prepare-and-measure, to the standard bipartite Bell scenario. Yet, many distinctive features of quantum theory are genuinely multipartite and cannot be reduced to two-party behaviour. In this work we are interested in extending this simultaneous purification inspired result to all multipartite communication schemes. As a first step, we unify and extend the simultaneous purification result from states to instruments and super-instruments, which are composable structures, and open up the possibility to explore more complex communication scenarios. Our main contribution is to establish that arbitrary compositions of non-signalling assemblages cannot escape the standard spatial quantum Bell correlations set. As a consequence, any interactive quantum realization of correlations outside of this set must involve at least one signalling assemblage of quantum operations, even when the resulting correlations are non-signalling."}

To address this issue, we introduce Quantum Elastic Network Models (QENMs) and utilize the quantum algorithm of Babbush et al.

This provides the first provable guarantee about Majorana Propagation for Hamiltonian evolution. As an application of this result, we prove that Majorana Propagation can efficiently simulate the time dynamics of any sparse quartic Hamiltonian up to time $t_{\\text{max}}(u)$ depending on the interaction strength $u$.

In densely integrated architectures, unwanted interactions between nearby qubits give rise to crosstalk errors that limit operational performance. In particular, direct exchange-type (XY) interactions are typically minimized by designing large frequency detunings between neighboring qubits at the hardware level. However, frequency crowding in large-scale systems ultimately restricts the achievable frequency separation. While such XY coupling facilitates entangling gate operations, its residual presence poses a key challenge during single-qubit controls. Here, we propose a scalable pulse-level control framework, incorporating frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD), to suppress XY crosstalk errors. This framework operates independently of coupling strengths, reducing calibration overhead and naturally supporting multi-qubit connectivity. Numerical simulations show orders-of-magnitude reductions in infidelity for both idle and single-qubit gates in a two-qubit system. We further validate scalability in a five-qubit layout, where crosstalk between a central qubit and four neighbors is simultaneously suppressed. Our crosstalk suppression framework provides a practical route toward high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures."}

This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations.

This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings.

By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \\pm \\hbarω$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters.

By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols.

Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band.

Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding.
