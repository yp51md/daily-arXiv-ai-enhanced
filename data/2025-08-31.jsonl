In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and\nhigher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the\nparity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary\npolyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the\ngauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged)\nfermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence\nof the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the\ndiscrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit.

Each of these contexts calls for\nan extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian\nlearning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between\na pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen\neither in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning\nmodel), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population\ndynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich\nclass of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite\nglobal effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation\nrates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement\n(reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active\nphase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is\ntwofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise\nto the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two\ndistinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects\nwith non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of\nactivity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill\" phenomenon."}
