We investigate the scaling of $Δ$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $Δ$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $Δ\\propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity."}

For barrier and entropic perturbations, the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is universally bounded by dynamical activity.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We address the problem of detecting initial system--environment correlations when the environment is not directly accessible. Most existing approaches rely on full state tomography or multiple system preparations, which can be experimentally demanding.\n  We show that, for a known interaction, it can be sufficient to monitor a single expectation value of the system. Focusing on a qubit interacting with an environment via isotropic Heisenberg exchange, we derive exact bounds on the signal $z(t)=\\langleσ_z^S\\rangle(t)$ that hold for all factorized initial states. These bounds define a \\emph{factorized envelope}: if an observed trajectory exits this envelope at any time, initial system--environment correlations are certified.\n  From a reduced-dynamics perspective, the envelope admits a clear operational interpretation as the admissible region generated by the standard product assignment (embedding) map, which serves as a null model for uncorrelated preparations. Envelope violations therefore rule out the entire product-assignment class using only a single calibrated observable.\n  We illustrate the method using three families of correlated initial states and observe clear envelope violations, including cases in which the reduced system state is maximally mixed. We further show that the same single-observable logic extends to an exactly solvable pure-dephasing spin--boson model with an infinite environment, where factorized initial states generate a simple coherence envelope whose violation certifies initial correlations. Overall, our results demonstrate that single-axis measurements, combined with a one-time calibration of $ρ_S(0)$, can certify initial system--environment correlations without tomography or environment access."}

Additionally, Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures can exist in a box potential in equilibrium with bosonic and fermionic vapor. We discuss the properties of Bose-Fermi droplets at nonzero temperatures in terms of the initial condensate fraction, total atom number, and interspecies attraction strength."}

By modeling cognition as a coarse-grained neural activity field governed by a variational free energy, we derive closed-form expressions for information capacity and structural susceptibility using a Gaussian maximum entropy approximation. The theory predicts a universal algebraic divergence of the susceptibility, $χ\\sim K^{-3/2}$, as the structural stiffness $K$ approaches the instability threshold. The exponent $γ= 3/2$ is consistent with the mean-field branching process universality class, thereby providing a theoretical rationale for the observed avalanche size exponent $τ\\approx 3/2$ in cortical dynamics without invoking microscopic equivalence. We identify adult cognition as a metabolically pinned non-equilibrium steady state maintained near the critical regime $Γ\\equiv K/α\\approx 1$ by continuous metabolic regulation, while pathological decline corresponds to a delocalization transition triggered by the violation of structural stability conditions. The framework generates concrete, falsifiable predictions for attention scaling, altered states of consciousness, and transcranial magnetic stimulation responses, each of which can be tested against existing neuroimaging and electrophysiological datasets."}

Typically, the imaginary-time Green's function is generated by Monte Carlo methods. As the one-point fermionic kernel diverges exponentially for large frequencies, numerical noise generically causes instabilities. We use a convolutional neural network to obtain the spectral density for a given imaginary time Green's function. The network is trained by data which we generate using random Gaussians. We improve the training data set available by including collision centers for the Gaussians rather than employing uniformly distributed Gaussians. Our network is constructed in such a way that its output fulfills positive semidefiniteness. We compare the results of our network with results of the Maximum Entropy method (MaxEnt), a standard method for the same reconstruction problem for the spectral density. This comparison is performed for three different cases, namely our Gaussian based test data as well as two physical models, the 1d Hubbard model showing spin-charge separation, and the two-dimensional SSH model in the self-consistent Born approximation. We find that the network outperforms MaxEnt when presented data close to the training set. For the physical models considered, MaxEnt recognizes physical features more precisely as compared to our network prediction. While it is hard to improve MaxEnt, the quality of the network depends on the training data set which can be systematically enhanced and improved."}

We demonstrate that tuning this phase substantially reduces the critical driving strength for dissipative phase transitions between stationary and non-stationary phases. We illustrate this mechanism in two experimentally relevant cavity QED settings: a two-species ensemble of two-level atoms and a single-species ensemble of three-level atoms. Our results establish phase control as a versatile tool for engineering dissipative phase transitions, with implications for quantum state preparation."}

Starting from the Hamiltonian of a generic linear quantum sensor, we derive the two-parameter quantum Fisher information matrix and establish the corresponding Cram'er-Rao bound, treating time as an uncertain (nuisance) parameter. Our analysis reveals a fundamental coupling between time and signal estimation that inherently degrades measurement sensitivity, with the standard single-parameter quantum limit recovered only at specific interrogation times or under special decoupling conditions. We then apply these results to an optomechanical gravimeter and explicitly derive an optimal decoupling condition under which the effects of time uncertainty are averaged out in a continuous measurement scheme.

While intralayer exchange interaction favors AM ordering in a single ILL layer across the entire family, the relatively weak interlayer coupling in most cases favors Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic order with a doubled magnetic unit cell. This means that most stoichiometric bulk materials, including the previously proposed candidate KV2Se2O, are not altermagnetic, with CsV2Te2O being the only exception.

While quantum simulators represent a promising approach to this long-standing problem, in practice it can be challenging to directly realize the required interactions, measure arbitrary observables, and mitigate errors. Here we use coherent mapping between the Rydberg and hyperfine qubits in a neutral atom array simulator to engineer and probe complex quantum dynamics. We combine efficient analog dynamics with fully programmable state preparation and measurement, leverage non-destructive readout for loss information and atomic qubit reuse, and use an atom reservoir for replacing lost atoms. With this analog-digital approach, we first demonstrate dynamical engineering of ring-exchange and particle hopping dynamics via Floquet driving and measure the spectral function of single excitations by evolving initial superposition states. Extending these techniques to a 271-site kagome lattice, we employ closed-loop optimization to target an out-of-equilibrium critical quantum spin liquid of the Rokhsar-Kivelson type. We observe the key features of such a state, including the absence of local order, many-body coherences between nearly equal-amplitude dimer configurations over up to 18 sites, and universal correlations consistent with predictions from field theory.

Thanks to its weak coupling to external perturbations, the large ground-state nuclear spin manifold of fermionic alkaline-earth atoms is an exciting resource to explore for quantum information. Simultaneous single atom and state-resolved detection however remains an outstanding challenge limiting the development of novel quantum computing and simulation schemes beyond qubits. Here, we report on a new imaging technique enabling the simultaneous detection of up to four quantum states encoded in the nuclear spin manifold of a single fermionic strontium atom within 100 microseconds, with state-resolved detection fidelities ranging from 0.936 to 0.997. This technique is further used to track the highly coherent nuclear spin dynamics after a quench highlighting the potential of this system for quantum information. These results offer fascinating perspectives for quantum science with multi-electron atoms ranging from qudit-based quantum computing to quantum simulations of the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model."}

While gauge-invariant quantities can be evaluated from overlap matrices between neighboring $k$ points, accessing the Berry connection itself as a smooth field requires specifying a continuous gauge over the Brillouin zone. Wannier-based workflows achieve this through projection onto localized orbitals, enabling stable evaluation of geometric quantities and response functions. In this setting, the Berry connection enters directly in Wannier-interpolated calculations of polarization, Berry curvature, optical conductivity, and related response functions. In practical implementations, however, the projection-gauge Berry connection is typically constructed from finite-difference overlaps between neighboring $k$ points, discretizing momentum derivatives and introducing errors tied to $k$-mesh spacing and gauge alignment. These effects can become numerically delicate in systems with small band gaps or when evaluating higher-order responses such as the Chern-Simons axion angle. Here, we derive an exact expression for the non-Abelian Berry connection in the projection gauge that is local in crystal momentum. Starting from projected and orthonormalized Bloch-like states, we obtain a closed-form equation expressed entirely in terms of $k$-local quantities. We validate the formulation in one and three dimensions by computing the Berry phase and Chern-Simons axion angle in tight-binding models. The resulting framework provides a stable route to evaluating geometric properties within Wannier interpolation schemes and future first-principles implementations."}

Exact analytical expressions are obtained in two spatial dimensions, while the three-dimensional case is studied numerically. We show that the thermodynamic curvature preserves its characteristic sign-positive for bosons and negative for fermions; even in the relativistic regime, reflecting effective attractive and repulsive statistical interactions, respectively. A distinctive relativistic effect is the shift of curvature singularities from the non-relativistic critical point to a mass-dependent threshold at $μ=mc^{2}$. In addition, the relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation temperature is evaluated, revealing explicit mass-dependent corrections to the non-relativistic result. These findings provide a unified geometric perspective on relativistic statistical systems and clarify the interplay between quantum statistics, relativistic kinematics, and critical behavior."}

In particular, the defect density can exhibit a suppression faster than the Kibble-Zurek prediction even when the quench crosses a critical point, while conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling may persist for quenches through a non-critical point.

Probing these nonequilibrium processes requires access to the thermodynamic limit, where the number of lattice sites becomes arbitrarily large, but conventional solvers are constrained to small systems due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space. Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), originally developed for solving partial differential equations, naturally accommodate inputs of varying resolution and are capable of capturing nonlocal effects. Here, we employ FNOs to learn the mapping from noise-perturbed ground-state momentum distributions to their post-pulse counterparts across a range of interaction strengths and driving parameters. Trained only on small lattices, the model generalizes zero-shot to much larger systems, producing physically reasonable momentum distributions well beyond the reach of numerical solvers. Specifically, the model can predict momentum distribution for a 1024x1024 system within a few seconds that matches the theoretical behavior of key observables, whereas direct numerical simulations have so far been restricted to edge sizes of ~30. These results demonstrate the potential of neural operators to directly access large-scale nonequilibrium dynamics, providing a new pathway toward the thermodynamic limit in strongly correlated materials."}

We observe contributions to the inelastic electrical resistivity, each dominating within a distinct temperature window. The prefactor of the T2 is consistent with the Kadowaki-Woods scaling for a Fermi liquid with moderate correlation. By performing thermal conductivity measurements at zero and finite magnetic field, we separate the electronic and the lattice contributions to the thermal conductivity. The Wiedemann-Franz law is is satisfied in the zero-temperature limit, while a downward deviation emerges at finite temperature due to the mismatch between the prefactors of the electrical and thermal quadratic resistivities, as reported in other metals. The Bloch-Grüneisen description of electron-phonon scattering successfully accounts for both electronic thermal and electrical transport, indicating a remarkably large e-ph collision cross section in CsV3Sb5."}

Using an atomistic model, we show that skyrmion velocity and Hall angle dependence is anisotropic with respect to the direction of the drive, due to the fourfold symmetry implied by the two sublattices of the altermagnet. The skyrmion Hall angle and velocity at fixed drive show strong variations for increasing ratios of the exchange constant of the sublattices, $J_2/J_1$. This fourfold anisotropy of altermagnetic (ATM) skyrmions also leads to anisotropic pinning effects for an ATM skyrmion interacting with isotropic circular pinning sites. We also propose a simple particle model for this system that takes into account this anisotropy and find that it captures both the variations of the ATM skyrmion Hall angle and velocity as a function of drive direction, as also found in the atomistic simulations. Using this particle model, we examine ATM skyrmions interacting with a periodic array of pinning sites. For increasing ratios of $J_2/J_1$, we find a strongly non-monotonic ATM skyrmion velocity, where there is a minimum in the velocity where the skyrmion locks to different symmetry directions of the periodic pinning lattice. For a random array, we find that ATM skyrmions show strongly anisotropic depinning thresholds and velocity responses for different drive directions, and that the Hall angle is nearly constant with drive. In comparison, for the same parameters, the depinning threshold for a ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion is lower, and the skyrmion Hall angle shows a strong velocity dependence. The lower depinning threshold for FM skyrmions is due to stronger Magnus forces."}

In HD-DMFT, the continuous hybridization function is approximated by a finite set of bath-site energies and hybridization amplitudes, determined by minimizing a highly non-convex multivariable cost function. As the number of bath sites increases, the optimization becomes more sensitive to the initial guess and more prone to suboptimal local minima, which can slow or destabilize the DMFT self-consistency loop. We reformulate bath fitting as a supervised regression problem and train a kernel ridge regression model to predict near-optimal discrete bath parameters directly from the target hybridization function on the Matsubara axis. To ensure physical relevance and data diversity, we construct the training dataset from tight-binding Hamiltonians of layered-perovskite-like ruthenate models across systematically deformed structures, instead of relying on naive random parameter sampling, and obtain high-quality labels through fully converged conventional bath fitting. Time-reversal symmetry is explicitly incorporated in both feature and target representations to reduce effective dimensionality and enforce physical consistency. Benchmarks in the non-interacting limit show that the learned initialization systematically reduces the initial fitting error, decreases the number of conjugate-gradient iterations, and improves robustness against local minima over a wide range of bath sizes.

Our method recovers the underlying error probabilities with near-exact precision in simulations and reduces logical error rates by up to 30.6(3)% for repetition codes and 8.1(2)% for surface codes on experimental data from Google's processor compared to previous state-of-the-art methods: correlation analysis and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. Our approach yields provably optimal, decoder-independent error priors by directly maximizing the syndrome likelihood, offering a powerful noise estimation and control tool for unlocking the full potential of current and future error-corrected quantum processors."}

Arjmandi"], "title": "Frozen and Growing Quantum Work under Noise: Coherence and Correlations as Key Resources", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate the decomposition of ergotropy into incoherent and coherent contributions for quantum systems subject to typical Markovian noise channels. The incoherent part originates from population inversion in the energy eigenbasis after dephasing, while the coherent part captures the role of quantum coherence in work extraction. For single-qubit systems, we derive explicit conditions for freezing and enhancement of coherent ergotropy and obtain an analytical upper bound, showing that it cannot exceed one half of the state's quantum coherence. We then study two classes of separable two-qubit states under local noise. For Bell-diagonal states, which are locally completely passive and possess no local coherence, we prove that the total extractable work equals the average of geometric quantum and classical correlations. In this case, coherent ergotropy cannot be enhanced, although freezing occurs under specific noise conditions. By contrast, for separable states with local coherence, coherent ergotropy can increase under all considered noise channels, including phase-flip and depolarizing noise. Extending the analysis to multipartite systems, we show that both the magnitude and range of noise-induced enhancement grow with the number of qubits, indicating collective reinforcement. Finally, we demonstrate through an explicit example that entanglement does not prevent this enhancement: coherent ergotropy may increase under noise even for entangled states. Our results reveal that noise can assist energy storage, challenging the conventional view of noise as purely detrimental and suggesting compatibility between noise-assisted enhancement and fast entanglement-based charging mechanisms in quantum batteries."}

As the strength of Rashba SOC is increased, topological edge states exhibit at the interface between the Rashba SOC and pristine armchair honeycomb nanoribbon (ANR), and these edge states remain robust under edge perturbations.

During these measurements, it was found that the out-of-plane couplings could explain the usual property of the increase in the magnetic transition temperature when CrSiTe$_3$ is exfoliated to monolayers.

While alternative synthesis routes under milder conditions are often associated with structural and surface defects that may have limited impact in ensemble measurements, demonstrating high optical quality at the level of individual pQDs constitutes the most stringent benchmark for a new synthesis protocol. Here, we demonstrate that a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) approach yields CsPbBr3 pQDs showing state-of-the-art optical properties at the scale of single emitters. By combining an amine-mediated post-synthetic size-trimming strategy with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) ligands for enhanced surface passivation and colloidal stability, we obtain isolated pQDs with stable emission and minimal spectral diffusion at cryogenic temperatures. Micro-photoluminescence experiments resolve the characteristic fine structure of the bright exciton, its low-energy optical phonon replicas, and the trion and biexciton states. Time-resolved and photon correlation measurements show a ~90 ps lifetime and high purity single photon emission, respectively. These results demonstrate that modified LARP synthesis constitutes an accessible alternative to hot injection, preserving the intrinsic excitonic and quantum optical properties of individual pQDs while offering greater flexibility for post-synthetic ligand engineering, as exemplified here by the use of DDAB for surface passivation."}

The choice of the orbital basis significantly affects circuit depth, with localised orbitals yielding lowest circuit depths. However, literature results point to large Trotter errors incurred by localised orbitals. Here, we therefore investigate the effect of orbital transformations on Trotter error. We consider three strategies to reduce Trotter error by orbital transformation: (i) The a priori selection of an orbital basis that produces low Trotter error. (ii) The derivation of an orbital basis that produces a ground state energy free of Trotter error (as we observed that the Trotter error is a continuous function in the Givens-rotation parameter, from which continuity of this error upon orbital transformation can be deduced). (iii) Application of propagators that change the computational basis between Trotter steps. Our numerical results show that reliably reducing Trotter error by orbital transformations is challenging. General recipes to produce low Trotter errors cannot be easily derived, despite analytical expressions which suggest ways to decrease Trotter error. Importantly, we found that localised orbital bases do not produce large Trotter errors in molecular calculations, which is an important result for efficient QPE set-ups."}

This paper reports the phase transitions and thermal scales across the Lieb/Kagome interconversion in the electronic interaction-strain-temperature space. Based on the thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures across the strain tuned interconversion of these line-graph lattices we have mapped out the low temperature phases and thermal transition scales, numerically determined using non perturbative calculations. While at the low temperatures, interaction-strain plane is spanned by magnetically correlated insulators, flat band induced weak transiently localized insulators and non Fermi liquid metallic phases, thermal fluctuations aid in to stabilize coexistent magnetic correlations.

In this study, we theoretically and experimentally explore the quantum coherence properties of lasers from a resource theory perspective, establishing a significant connection between photonics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. We demonstrate that the maximum achievable quantum coherence for laser light is constrained by spontaneous emission and the purity of the dephased laser field state. As a critical example application in quantum information protocols, we show that the quantum coherence of a laser field with a given mean photon number directly governs the maximum purity attainable when initializing a qubit in a superposition state through resonant driving. Our findings are highly relevant for bridging applied physics and engineering with integrated photonic quantum technologies and resource theories, paving the way for reliable benchmarking of various coherent light sources for applications in photonics and quantum protocols."}

We investigate the scaling of $Δ$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $Δ$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $Δ\\propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity."}

We then discuss how the time rescaling (TR) method can be modified to be applied in optical systems, then apply it in the conversion process to create a TR-STIRAP protocol, showing that full conversion is also obtained, but at a fraction of the propagation distance. We also show how the original shaping of the coupling coefficients required by the TR-STIRAP can be approximated by gaussian functions with high conversion fidelity, thus simplifying the experimental implementation. This protocol has the potential to be used in several areas, including the integration of photon sources and efficient detectors for quantum key distribution."}

Unrestricted mean-field calculations of the effective Hamiltonian on large finite lattices are combined with analyses in the thermodynamic limit, revealing a rich phase diagram with extensive regions of coexisting orders. We find that $d$-wave superconductivity coexists with Néel order on the electron-doped side. On the hole-doped side, superconductivity is found to coexist with spiral or stripe magnetic orders. Within the stripe ordered region, the superconducting order parameter is spatially modulated, with a period that follows the charge modulation of the stripes.

The quantization condition for the wavevectors is not that of a quantum box, but given instead by a transcendental equation linking the involved wavevectors. For the wire with superconducting pairing, the presence of electron and hole channels complicates the composition of the eigenstates.

Here, we overcome this long-standing challenge by leveraging the inherently ultralow nonlinearity of hollow-core fiber (HCF) to suppress SpRS noise. By operating both the quantum time synchronization (QTS) and classical optical frequency transfer (OFT) signals within the telecom C-band, separated by only ~10 nm, we successfully demonstrate their simultaneous transmission over a 122-km HCF link. With a classical OFT power of 1 mW, the QTS performance shows negligible degradation, maintaining sub-picosecond time stability at 2000 s, while the OFT achieves a fractional frequency instability of 10^-20. Near-sub-picosecond QTS stability is preserved even when the classical power is increased to 3 mW. Furthermore, simulations based on our experimental data indicate that with next-generation low-loss HCF, the platform can tolerate classical powers beyond 10 mW and extend the QTS range to over 500 km.

By fitting pore diffusion coefficients to three experimental conductance points, we reproduce the entire experimental AMFE curve as well as anion leakage in CaCl$_2$ seen in experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. Remarkably, vastly different microscopic models of the surface groups yield indistinguishable device-level conductance curves when the DCA is matched, despite substantial differences in local Ca$^{2+}$ concentration profiles. Our results demonstrate that AMFE in wide nanopores is governed by a delicate interplay between charge inversion, anion leakage, and ionic mobility, underlying that in wide pores monovalent vs.\\ divalent cation selectivity is modulated by cations vs.\\ anion selecivity."}

By employing the exceptional point (EP) property of the system, we demonstrate theoretically superradiant lasing with linewidths in the $μ$Hz range, sustained at the high-power level. This is achieved by incoherently pumping optical lattice clock transitions with ultracold alkaline-earth strontium-87 atoms in the EP of a $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system. Physically, the atomic coherence reaches a maximum in the EP, significantly amplifying the superradiance effect and resulting in superradiant lasing with an ultranarrow linewidth. This linewidth is even three orders of magnitude smaller than that of superradiant lasing in the systems without EP. Our work extends the realm of superradiant lasing by introducing the EP property, and offers promising applications for developing atomic clocks with exceptional stability and accuracy."}

The model is based on a master equation approach, where the partial secular approximation has been carefully performed in order to obtain accurate results. Our study assumes an ohmic spectral density for the two thermal baths of the model. This is in contrast with previous treatments of the quantum heat valve, where the baths have been assumed as being structured with a peaked spectral density near the resonance frequency of the resonator. These studies have also taken the resonator to be a part of the open quantum system of interest, which results in double counting of the resonator, as the latter appears both in the spectral density of the bath and as a part of the open system. Although this model accounts for the observations in a satisfactory way, it raises issues regarding its physical interpretation. Our method solves this conceptual problem. We apply it to describe an experiment on a quantum heat valve, showing that it successfully captures the experimental results and improves upon the previous theoretical model, which suffered from the resonator double-counting issue. Our findings confirm that the careful application of the master equation approach, in particular when it comes to the secular approximation, is a useful tool for explaining realistic experimental setups."}

A natural goal is to combine them to outperform either approach alone. Such a benefit is not automatic: physical DD can conflict with an encoded subspace, and QEC performance is governed by the errors that survive decoding, not necessarily those DD suppresses. We analyze a hybrid memory cycle where DD is implemented logically (LDD) using normalizer elements of an $[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizer code, followed by a round of syndrome measurement and recovery (or, in the detection setting, postselection on a trivial syndrome). In an effective Pauli model with physical error probability $p$, LDD suppression factor $p_{DD}$, and recovery imperfection rate $p_{QEC}$ (or $p_{QED}$), we derive closed-form entanglement-fidelity expressions for QEC-only, LDD-only, physical DD, and the hybrid LDD+QEC protocol. The formulas are expressed via a small set of code-dependent weight enumerator polynomials, making the role of the decoder and the LDD group explicit. For ideal recovery LDD+QEC outperforms QEC-only iff the conditional fraction of uncorrectable Pauli errors is larger in the LDD-suppressed sector than in the unsuppressed sector. In the low-noise regime, a sufficient design rule guaranteeing hybrid advantage is that LDD suppresses at least one minimum-weight uncorrectable Pauli error for the chosen recovery map. We show how stabilizer-equivalent choices of LDD generators can be used to enforce this condition. We supplement our analysis with numerical results for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code and a $[[13,1,3]]$ code, mapping regions of hybrid-protocol advantage in parameter space beyond the small-$p$ regime. Our work illustrates the need for co-design of the code, decoder, and logical decoupling group, and clarifies the conditions under which the hybrid LDD+QEC protocol is advantageous."}

Our scheme is enabled by Alice communicating to Bob only two of the BM outcomes corresponding to the states that are decoherence-free under common dephasing at Alice's wing. On the other hand, Bob is asked to discard the states of his qubit for the other two BM outcomes in order to maximize fidelity of the teleported state. This ensures the teleportation fidelity's independence of noise parameters in Alice's wing. We formulate the protocol in terms of a generic two-level quantum system, subjected to non-Markovian dephasing noise, applicable for any pure maximally/non-maximally entangled state as well as a Werner-type mixed state as resource. Notably, we show that high fidelity is achievable even using resource states with small values of the entanglement measure.

Numerical simulations on the 1D Heisenberg XYZ model validate the theoretical soundness and shot-noise resilience of our method.

In our method, information is obtained by measuring the difference of the evolution of the qubit coherence resulting from preparation phase when the environment evolution is conditional on the qubit pointer state.

The key advantage of this approach is its simplicity and minimal experimental requirements, allowing the inference of initial nuclear polarizations without direct access to the environment.

Even on fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum algorithms with convergence guarantees -- such as quantum phase estimation and quantum subspace methods -- require an initial state with sufficiently large overlap with the true ground state to be effective. Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are natural candidates for preparing such states; however, standard VQEs typically exhibit poor generalization, requiring retraining for each Hamiltonian instance, and often suffer from barren plateaus, where gradients can vanish exponentially with circuit depth and system size. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end representation learning framework that combines a graph autoencoder with a classical neural network to generate VQE parameters that generalize across Hamiltonian instances. By encoding interaction topology and coupling structure, the proposed model produces high-overlap initial states without instance-specific optimization. Through extensive numerical experiments on families of one- and two-local Hamiltonians, we demonstrate improved generalization and trainability, manifested as reduced test error and a significantly milder decay of gradient variance. We further show that our method substantially accelerates convergence in quantum subspace-based eigensolvers, highlighting its practical impact for downstream quantum algorithms."}

This is in contrast with previous treatments of the quantum heat valve, where the baths have been assumed as being structured with a peaked spectral density near the resonance frequency of the resonator. These studies have also taken the resonator to be a part of the open quantum system of interest, which results in double counting of the resonator, as the latter appears both in the spectral density of the bath and as a part of the open system. Although this model accounts for the observations in a satisfactory way, it raises issues regarding its physical interpretation. Our method solves this conceptual problem. We apply it to describe an experiment on a quantum heat valve, showing that it successfully captures the experimental results and improves upon the previous theoretical model, which suffered from the resonator double-counting issue.

This paper proposes a quantum-native organizational principle based on dynamic composition, which replaces static layering with a distributed orchestration fabric driven by the node local state and in-band control. Each node runs a Dynamic Kernel that i) constructs a local PoA of candidate steps to advance a service intent, and ii) executes the PoA by composing atomic micro-protocols into context-aware procedures (the meta-protocols). Quantum packets carry an in-band control-field (the meta-header) containing the service intent and an append-only list of action-commit records, termed as stamps. Successive nodes exploit this minimal, authoritative history to construct their local PoAs. As quantum packets progress, these local commits collectively induce a network-wide, direct acyclic graph that certifies end-to-end service fulfillment, without requiring global synchronization. In contrast to classical encapsulation, the proposed suite enforces order by certification: dependency-aware local scheduling decides what may run at a certain node, stamps certify what did run and constrain subsequent planning. By embedding procedural control within the quantum packet, the design ensures coherence and consistency between entanglement-state evolution and control-flow, preventing divergence between resource state ad protocol logic, while remaining MP-agnostic and implementation-decoupled. The resulting suite is modular, adaptable to entanglement dynamics, and scalable. It operates correctly with or without optional control-plane hints. Indeed, when present, hints can steer QoS policies, without changing semantics. We argue that dynamic composition is the organizing principle required for a truly quantum-native Internet."}

Using experimentally estimated coupling parameters, we compute the thermal state of the system and analyze the dependence of quantum resources on temperature and magnetic field. The results indicate that the quantum resources of the nickel-radical molecular magnet persist even at room temperature. We show that while negativity (the entanglement measure) rapidly vanishes with increasing temperature and magnetic field, measurement-induced nonlocality and quantum coherence remain comparatively more stable and persist in regions where entanglement is absent. These results highlight the significance of nonclassical correlations beyond entanglement in thermally activated spin systems and suggest that such molecular magnets could serve as viable platforms for quantum information processing in realistic conditions."}

Utilizing a short-time dynamical approach, we perform a perturbative Taylor expansion of the reduced density matrix to characterize the bipartite quantum correlations between the hexagonal layers. We demonstrate that the system undergoes a rapid transition from a localized product state in the conduction bands at t = 0 to a coherent superposition of valence and conduction band states. Our results indicate that the degree of entanglement is highly sensitive to the interlayer photon propagator, which contains the geometric ratios of the layer positions and the height cavity, and the specific Fermi energy and SOI signatures of the respective layers. We show the emergence of spacelike-separated quantum correlations in the ultra-short evolution regime, suggesting that heterostructures in cavities may be suitable to develop experiments for a deep understanding of spacelike-separated quantum effects."}

We formulate the system dynamics using an effective master-equation approach and benchmark it against quantum Langevin and dressed-state master-equation descriptions. With experimentally realistic parameters, we predict clear quantum signatures, including photon blockade and the generation of mechanical cat states.

However, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era devices are currently prone to various sources of error. Quantum error correction (QEC) shows promise as a path towards fault tolerant quantum computing. Surface codes, in particular, have become ubiquitous throughout literature for their efficacy as a quantum error correcting code, and can execute quantum circuits via lattice surgery operations. Lattice surgery also allows for logical qubits to maneuver around the architecture, if there is space for it. Hardware used for near-term demonstrations have both spatially and temporally varying error results in logical qubits. By maneuvering logical qubits around the topology, an average logical error rate (LER) can be enforced. We propose cyclic qubit mappings (CQM), a dynamic remapping technique implemented during compilation to mitigate hardware heterogeneity by expanding and contracting logical qubits. In addition to LER averaging, CQM shows initial promise given it's minimal execution time overhead and effective resource utilization."}

In practice, however, quantum devices exhibit both systematic coherent miscalibrations and temporally correlated fluctuations, which complicate error diagnosis and mitigation. Here, we apply a technique based on tangent-space decomposition to characterize such error in single-qubit quantum gates implemented on a trapped ion platform. Small imperfections in a quantum operation are treated as perturbations of the target quantum map, represented as tangent vectors in the space of quantum channels. This formulations enables a natural decomposition of the deviation into three components corresponding to coherent, Markovian and non-Markovian processes.The relative weights of these components provide a quantitative measure of the contribution from each type of error mechanism, directly from a single tomographic snapshot. We experimentally validate this method on a single-qubit gates implemented on a trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion, where control is achieved through laser-driven optical transitions. By analyzing experimentally reconstructed process matrices, expressed in the Pauli Transfer Matrix and Choi representations, we identify and quantify non-Markovian effects arising from controlled injection of slow fluctuations in the experimental environment. We also characterize deterministic coherent miscalibrations using the same technique. This approach provides a physically transparent and experimentally accessible tool for diagnosing complex error sources in quantum control systems."}

Our motivation for this investigation is the flexibility the bosonic fock space affords as any classical probability distribution can be realized on it making it a versatile framework to work with for quantum processes. We proceed by constructing a minimal bosonization of a system with one bosonic and two fermionic degrees of freedom. We iterate this process to construct a tower of SUSY systems that is akin to unfolded Adinkras. We then identify an osp(2|2) symmetry of the system constructed. To build an irreducible representation of the system we induce representations across the sectors, a first to our knowledge, as the previous work have focused on induction only within the bosonic sector. First, we start with a fermionic representation using Clifford algebras and then induce a representation to gl(2|2) and restrict it to osp(2|2). In the second method, we induce a representation from that of the bosonic sector. In both cases, our representations are in terms of qubit operators that provide a way to solve SUSY problems using quantum information based approaches. Depending upon the direction of induction the representations are suitable for implementation on a hybrid qubit and fermionic or bosonic quantum computers."}

This yields new or improved protocols for tasks such as operator sampling, the computation of OTOCs/superoperator expectation values and their higher order moments, two-point correlators, and operator stabilizer and entanglement entropies. Our approach is also amenable to implementation, as it inherits the structure and resource requirements of the (forward and time-reversed) Schrödinger-picture quantum simulation problem. We demonstrate this by proposing implementations of our framework for a 2D problem on digital and analog quantum simulators, taking into account device connectivity constraints."}

Analogous to a typical MZ interferometer, the generated interference pattern of the final qubit population carries information about the magnon dynamics. One important application of the proposed scheme is the study of single magnon decoherence.

We investigate a spin-1/2 ladder with asymmetric XY leg couplings and tunable Ising interactions on the rungs, and identify the microscopic origin of many-body localization (MBL) in this setting. Through a suite of diagnostics -including entanglement dynamics, fidelity susceptibility, adiabatic gauge potential norms, level-spacing statistics and entropy of eigenstates- we uncover a reentrant progression of dynamical regimes as the rung coupling Jz is varied: integrable behavior at Jz=0, quantum chaos at intermediate Jz, and a robust nonthermal regime at strong coupling. In the latter regime, we demonstrate the emergence of a reversed quantum disentangled liquid (reversed-QDL), where the light species thermalizes while the heavy species remains localized. The strong-coupling limit further yields emergent local integrals of motion anchored in a fixed-point structure, providing a microscopic origin of the observed quasi-MBL dynamics. These results establish reversed-QDL as a distinct, disorder-free route to nonergodicity and broaden the classification of dynamical phases in quantum matter."}

However, no laser is absolutely ideal and the implications of deviations from perfect coherence in quantum technological tasks remain unclear. In this study, we theoretically and experimentally explore the quantum coherence properties of lasers from a resource theory perspective, establishing a significant connection between photonics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. We demonstrate that the maximum achievable quantum coherence for laser light is constrained by spontaneous emission and the purity of the dephased laser field state. As a critical example application in quantum information protocols, we show that the quantum coherence of a laser field with a given mean photon number directly governs the maximum purity attainable when initializing a qubit in a superposition state through resonant driving. Our findings are highly relevant for bridging applied physics and engineering with integrated photonic quantum technologies and resource theories, paving the way for reliable benchmarking of various coherent light sources for applications in photonics and quantum protocols."}

As a result of the Majorana modes, all Floquet eigenstates come in quadruplets in the integrable limit.

In particular, the defect density can exhibit a suppression faster than the Kibble-Zurek prediction even when the quench crosses a critical point, while conventional Kibble-Zurek scaling may persist for quenches through a non-critical point.

We investigate the scaling of $Δ$ with system size $N$ for two paradigmatic quantum spin-glass models: the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson (2D-EA) and the all-to-all Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) models. Utilizing a newly proposed unbiased energy-gap estimator for continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by high-performance sparse eigenvalue solvers, we characterize the gap distributions across disorder realizations. It is found that, in the 2D-EA case, the inverse-gap distribution develops a fat tail with infinite variance as $N$ increases. This indicates that the unfavorable super-algebraic scaling of $Δ$, recently reported for binary couplings [Nature 631, 749 (2024)], persists for the Gaussian disorder considered here, pointing to a universal feature of 2D spin glasses. Conversely, the SK model retains a finite-variance distribution, with the disorder-averaged gap following a rather slow power law, close to $Δ\\propto N^{-1/3}$. This finding provides a promising outlook for the potential efficiency of quantum annealers for optimization problems with dense connectivity."}
