The article is related to arXiv:2302.14619", "summary": "We present a novel framework for quantizing constrained quantum systems in\nwhich the processes of quantization and constraint enforcement are performed\nsimultaneously. The approach is based on an extension of the stationary action\nprinciple, incorporating an information-theoretic term arising from vacuum\nfluctuations. Constraints are included directly in the Lagrangian via Lagrange\nmultipliers, allowing the subsequent variational procedure to yield the quantum\ndynamics without ambiguity regarding the order of quantization and reduction.\nWe demonstrate the method through two examples: (i) a one-dimensional system\nwith vanishing local momentum, where the simultaneous approach produces the\ntime-independent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation while conventional reduced and Dirac\nquantization yield only trivial states, and (ii) a bipartite system with global\ntranslational invariance, where all three methods agree. These results show\nthat the proposed framework generalizes standard quantization schemes and\nprovides a consistent treatment of systems with constraints that cannot be\nexpressed as linear operators acting on the wave function. In addition to a\nunified variational principle for constrained quantum systems, the formalism\nalso offers an information-theoretic perspective on quantum effects arising\nfrom vacuum fluctuations."}

In the linear\nresponse regime, where a non-crossing principle holds in the absence of\nexternal driving, we obtain exact results. In particular, we demonstrate that\nthe relaxation rate of the total spontaneous magnetization becomes quantized\nfor arbitrary initial conditions involving multiple, possibly nested, loops,\nwith discrete jumps corresponding to individual loop collapse events. Under\nexternal driving, the avoidance principle breaks down due to sparse\ninteractions between interfaces-either within a single loop or between multiple\nloops-leading to coalescence or splitting events that change the number of\nloops. A quantized geometrical observable involving the total area and\nperimeter is identified in this case as well, exhibiting discrete jumps both at\ninterface interaction events and at individual loop collapses. We further use\napproximate area-perimeter relations to estimate the spontaneous collapse\nlifetimes of compact magnetic domains, as well as their dynamics under\nalternating-field-assisted collapse in disordered ultrathin magnetic films.

It may\ntherefore be possible to maintain local causality by rejecting one of these\nother assumptions instead. One possibility that has recently received\nsignificant attention involves rejecting the principle of statistical\nindependence (SI). In this paper, we consider the frequency interpretation of\nSI, which states that $\\rho(\\lambda) \\approx \\rho(\\lambda | Z)$, where\n$\\rho(\\lambda)$ is the relative frequency of an element of an ensemble being in\nthe state $\\lambda$, and $Z$ is a label that separates the ensemble into\napparently randomly selected sub-ensembles. SI is violated when the\nsub-ensemble frequency $\\rho(\\lambda | Z)$ fails to be representative of the\nensemble frequency $\\rho(\\lambda)$. We argue that physical theories that\nsystematically violate SI should all be understood as superdeterministic. This\nperspective on SI sheds light on a number of issues that are being debated in\nthe superdeterminism literature, especially concerning its scope and\nphilosophical consequences. Regarding scope, we argue that superdeterministic\ntheories fall into three categories, deterministic theories with fine-tuned\ninitial conditions, fluke theories, and nomic exclusion theories.

Here, we propose and validate a novel platform that harnesses the\nMeissner effect in a topological insulator (TI) nanowire partially covered by a\nsuperconducting (SC) layer. Under an external magnetic field, Meissner\nscreening currents in the SC induce a spatially varying Doppler shift on the TI\nsurface. This effect generates a highly anisotropic effective g-factor, which\nselectively drives a topological phase transition localized on the nanowire's\nbottom surface. This mechanism is crucial as it spatially separates the\ntopological phase from the SC/TI interface, permitting strong proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity while preventing detrimental band renormalization at the\ninterface from closing the topological gap. Furthermore, by confining the\ntopological superconducting phase to the gate-tunable bottom surface, our\nplatform fully leverages the intrinsic disorder resilience of the TI's\ntopologically protected surface states.

It is widely recognized that quantum\nmemory and coherent operations help avoid exponential sample complexity, by\nmapping nonlinear properties onto linear observables over multiple copies of\nthe target state. In this work, we prove that such a conversion is not only\nsufficient but also necessary. Specifically, we prove that the estimation of\n$\\mathrm{tr}(\\rho^{k} O)$ for a broad class of observables $O$ is exponentially\nhard for any protocol restricted to $(k-1)$-replica joint measurements, whereas\naccess to one additional replica reduces the complexity to a constant. These\nresults establish, for the first time, an exponential separation between\n$(k-1)$- and $k$-replica protocols for any integer $k>2$, thereby introducing a\nfine-grained hierarchy of replica-based quantum advantage and resolving an open\nquestion in the literature. The technical core is a general\nindistinguishability principle showing that any ensemble constructed from large\nHaar random states via tensor products and mixtures is hard to distinguish from\nits average. Leveraging this principle, we further prove that $k$-replica joint\nmeasurements are also necessary for distinguishing rank-$k$ density matrices\nfrom rank-$(k-1)$ ones.

Floquet codes are a class of\ndynamically generated, stabilizer-based codes in which low-weight parity\nmeasurements are applied in a time-periodic schedule. Furthermore, for several\nFloquet codes, the encoding rate becomes finite even for an infinitely large\nqubit number. However, despite these advantageous properties, existing Floquet\ncodes require handling more intricate, often hypergraph-structured syndromes\nfrom the decoding perspective, which makes decoding comparatively demanding. We\ngive a concrete method for solving this issue by proposing hyperbolic color\nFloquet (HCF) code. To this end, we simultaneously take advantage of hyperbolic\nFloquet and Floquet color codes. Parity measurements in our code consist of the\nrepetitions of six-step measurements on (semi-)hyperbolic three-colorable\ntilings. Since each step just measures $X \\otimes X$ or $Z \\otimes Z$, our code\non the regular $\\{8,3\\}$ lattice has the following three advantages: (i) parity\nmeasurements are weight-2, (ii) for the numbers $k$ and $n$ of logical and\nphysical qubits, respectively, the encoding rate is finite, i.e., $\\lim_{n \\to\n\\infty} k/n = 1/8$, and (iii) the code distance is proportional to $\\log n$.\nFrom the above property, each single-fault event generally affects at most two\ndetectors, which implies ``graph-edge'' syndromes, and hence decoding with a\nminimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder is efficient and virtually\nscales near-linearly in the number of physical qubits $n$. This is a stark\ncontrast to several known Floquet codes because their parity measurements\nrepeat the measurements of $X\\!\\otimes\\!X$, $Y\\!\\otimes\\!Y$, and\n$Z\\!\\otimes\\!Z$, and thus the syndromes are represented as a hypergraph, which\nbasically requires decoders with longer decoding time."}

In this\nwork, we introduce a framework for resource-efficient simultaneous estimation\nof quantum state moments via qubit reuse. For an $m$-qubit quantum state\n$\\rho$, our method achieves the simultaneous estimation of the full hierarchy\nof moments $\\text{Tr}(\\rho^2), \\dots, \\text{Tr}(\\rho^k)$, as well as arbitrary\npolynomial functionals and their observable-weighted counterparts.

We demonstrate this protocol's utility by showing that the\nestimated moments yield tight bounds on a state's maximum eigenvalue and\npresent applications in quantum virtual cooling to access low-energy states of\nthe Heisenberg model.

Both the\nelectromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions,\nwhile propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive\nparticles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective\npotentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work,\nwe analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom\ninterferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in\natom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a\ngravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed\nfor clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure\nthe spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks.

By\nemploying a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model coupled to baths via dephasing and\namplitude-damping noise, we demonstrate that correlations in reservoirs can\nsignificantly enhance battery's performance compared to local noise. In the\ndephasing scenario, we prove that correlated reservoirs produce a finite amount\nof extractable work, or ergotropy, during the transient regime when a two-cell\nbattery is initialized in a product state while local noise yields vanishing\nergotropy at all times, despite nonvanishing stored energy in both cases.\nNumerical simulations confirm that this advantage persists across larger system\nsizes and for both entangled and product initial states. We also find that the\ndynamics of quantum coherence closely mirror those of ergotropy, highlighting\ncoherence as a key resource underlying the enhanced performance of quantum\nbatteries. Further, we observe that the fraction of stored energy extracted\nfrom quantum batteries displays a sharper contrast between the correlated and\nlocal reservoirs. Moreover, for dephasing noise, this fraction remains\nindependent of system size, whereas in the amplitude damping case, it exhibits\na clear system-size dependence within the transient regime, highlighting\ndistinct operational behaviors under different noise models.

While\nquantitative quantum soundness has been established for the KLVY compiler in\nthe bipartite case, it has only been shown asymptotically for multipartite\ngames.
