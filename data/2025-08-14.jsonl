In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus\nevading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium\ntopology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we\nintroduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes\nthe equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for\nchiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe\nmeasurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question. Our\nprotocol uncovers a direct dynamical signature of SPT phases and, most\nimportantly, paves the way for a general diagnostic framework that can be\nextended to other symmetry classes and dimensions."}

Superlattices, characterized by periodic\nrepetitions of two or more materials in different dimensions, have emerged as a\npromising area of investigation. We present a study of the phonon interference\neffect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp\ninterfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity\nmeasurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice\nnanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a\nminimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to\nroom temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from\ncoherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed\nby surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is\nalso observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab\ninitio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics\ncalculations. These findings provide insights into the wave-like and\nparticle-like transport of phonons in superlattice nanowires and demonstrate\nthe potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the\nsuperlattice structure."}

This\ncomputationally efficient approach yields both positive results, enumerating\nall candidate recurrence times and definitive negative results, rigorously\nruling out exact recurrences for given Hamiltonian parameters. We further prove\nthat rational Hamiltonian parameters do not, in general, guarantee exact\nrecurrence, revealing a subtle interplay between system parameters and\nlong-time dynamics. Our findings sharpen the theoretical understanding of\nquantum recurrences, clarify their relationship to quantum chaos, and highlight\nparameter regimes of special interest for quantum metrology and control."}

In particular, one can observe a large amount of photon-number\nsqueezing in the emission under certain conditions; even a Fock state can be\nproduced. We discuss the quantum statistics of the emission for various\nparameters, including different initial conditions for the atomic ensemble. To\nobtain these results, we have developed a formalism where we are able to\ncalculate the quantum statistics of the emission over long time-scales even\nwhen the number of atoms in the ensemble is quite large."}

Code available at\n  https://github.com/sujeet-bhalerao/perm-inv-codes", "summary": "In this work we improve the quantum communication rates of various quantum\nchannels of interest using permutation-invariant quantum codes. We focus in\nparticular on parametrized families of quantum channels and aim to improve\nbounds on their quantum capacity threshold, defined as the lowest noise level\nat which the quantum capacity of the channel family vanishes. These thresholds\nare important quantities as they mark the noise level up to which faithful\nquantum communication is theoretically possible. Our method exploits the fact\nthat independent and identically distributed quantum channels preserve any\npermutation symmetry present at the input. The resulting symmetric output\nstates can be described succinctly using the representation theory of the\nsymmetric and general linear groups, which we use to derive an efficient\nalgorithm for computing the channel coherent information of a\npermutation-invariant code. Our approach allows us to evaluate coherent\ninformation values for a large number of channel copies, e.g., at least 100\nchannel copies for qubit channels. We apply this method to various physically\nrelevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure\nchannel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing\nchannel. For each channel family we obtain improved lower bounds on their\nquantum capacities. For example, for the 2-Pauli and BB84 channel families we\nsignificantly improve the best known quantum capacity thresholds derived in\n[Fern, Whaley 2008]. These threshold improvements are achieved using a\nrepetition code-like input state with non-orthogonal code states, which we\nfurther analyze in our representation-theoretic framework."}

In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus\nevading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium\ntopology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we\nintroduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes\nthe equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for\nchiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe\nmeasurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question.

Superlattices, characterized by periodic\nrepetitions of two or more materials in different dimensions, have emerged as a\npromising area of investigation. We present a study of the phonon interference\neffect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp\ninterfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity\nmeasurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice\nnanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a\nminimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to\nroom temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from\ncoherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed\nby surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is\nalso observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab\ninitio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics\ncalculations. These findings provide insights into the wave-like and\nparticle-like transport of phonons in superlattice nanowires and demonstrate\nthe potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the\nsuperlattice structure."}

Previously it was shown that the\nsign structures of frustrated systems are of complex nature: specifically,\nneural networks of popular architectures lack the generalization ability\nnecessary to effectively reconstruct sign structures in supervised learning\nsettings. This is believed to be an obstacle for applications of neural quantum\nstates to frustrated systems. In the present work, we develop an alternative\nlanguage for the analysis of sign structures based on representing them as\npolynomial functions defined on the Boolean hypercube - an approach called\nBoolean Fourier analysis. We discuss the relations between the properties of\nthe Boolean Fourier series and the learning complexity of sign structures, and\ndemonstrate that such polynomials can potentially serve as variational\nans\\\"atze for the complex sign structures that dramatically outperform neural\nnetworks in terms of generalization ability. While ans\\\"atze of this type\ncannot yet be directly used in the context of variational optimization, they\nindicate that the complexity of sign structures is not an insurmountable curse,\nand can potentially be learned with better designed NQS architectures. Finally,\nwe show how augmenting data with Boolean functions can aid sign prediction by\nneural networks."}
