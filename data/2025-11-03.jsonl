We demonstrate this capability in a finite-size, three-qubit\nsystem described by the transverse-field Floquet Ising model. In this system,\nwe identify a period-doubling (PD) dynamical phase that exhibits a stark\nasymmetry in metrological sensitivity to the magnetic field applied on the\nqubits and to the coupling strength between the qubits. The PD phase originates\nfrom $\\pi$-pairing, where the initial state exhibits strong overlap with\n$\\pi$-paired Floquet eigenstates, leading to robust period-doubled dynamics and\nenhanced metrological sensitivity. The analysis of quantum Fisher information\nreveals that the PD regime significantly enhances precision for estimating the\nIsing interaction strength while simultaneously suppressing sensitivity to the\ntransverse magnetic field. Conversely, non-PD regimes are optimal for sensing\nthe transverse field. This filtering effect is robust for larger system sizes\nand is quantifiable using experimentally accessible observables, such as\nmagnetization and two-qubit correlations, via the classical Fisher information.\nOur work shows that distinct dynamical regimes in finite-size Floquet systems\ncan be harnessed for targeted quantum sensing."}
