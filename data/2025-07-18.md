Motivation: 解决当前2+1D晶格规范理论实验实现中系统规模小和场表示受限的问题，为探索3+1D量子色动力学奠定基础。

Method: 通过高斯定律积分掉物质场，将量子链接模型重新表述为纯自旋形式，适用于任意空间维度的量子比特编码。

Abstract: A major challenge in the burgeoning field of quantum simulation for
high-energy physics is the realization of scalable $2+1$D lattice gauge
theories on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, which is an essential step
towards the overarching goal of probing $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics on a
quantum computer. Despite great progress, current experimental implementations
of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories are mostly restricted to relatively small
system sizes and two-level representations of the gauge and electric fields.
Here, we propose a resource-efficient method for quantum simulating $2+1$D
spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theories with dynamical
matter using qudit-based quantum processors. By integrating out the matter
fields through Gauss's law, we reformulate the quantum link model in a purely
spin picture compatible with qudit encoding across arbitrary spatial
dimensions, eliminating the need for ancillary qubits and reducing resource
overhead. Focusing first on the spin-$1/2$ case, we construct explicit circuits
for the full Hamiltonian and demonstrate through numerical simulations that the
first-order Trotterized circuits accurately capture the quench dynamics even in
the presence of realistic noise levels. Additionally, we introduce a general
method for constructing coupling-term circuits for higher-spin representations
$S>1/2$. Compared to conventional qubit encodings, our framework significantly
reduces the number of quantum resources and gate count. Our approach
significantly enhances scalability and fidelity for probing nonequilibrium
phenomena in higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories, and is readily amenable
to implementation on state-of-the-art qudit platforms.

Abstract: An overarching goal in the flourishing field of quantum simulation for
high-energy physics is the first-principles study of the microscopic dynamics
of scattering processes on a quantum computer. Currently, this is hampered by
small system sizes and a restriction to two-level representations of the gauge
fields in state-of-the-art quantum simulators. Here, we propose efficient
experimentally feasible digital qudit quantum circuits for far-from-equilibrium
quench dynamics of a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link lattice gauge theory, where
the electric and gauge fields are represented as spin-$1$ operators. Using
dedicated numerical simulations, we probe scattering processes in this model on
these proposed circuits, focusing on meson-meson and meson-antimeson
collisions. The latter are not possible with a two-level representation of the
fields, highlighting the suitability of qudits in exploring scattering
processes relevant to quantum electrodynamics. The probed scattering dynamics
showcases rich physics, including meson flipping and a reflection-transmission
transition in meson-antimeson collisions as a function of the gauge coupling
strength. Our simulations, which include realistic noise models of dephasing
and depolarization, show very good agreement with the exact noiseless dynamics,
signaling the readiness of current qudit platforms to observe microscopic
scattering dynamics with significantly shallower circuit depths than their
qubit counterparts.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of topology on the magnetic response of
inductively coupled superconducting flux-qubit networks. Using exact
diagonalization methods and linear response theory, we compare the magnetic
response of linear and cross-shaped array geometries, used as paradigmatic
examples. We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays
yields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to
linear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling
among the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish
quantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum
circuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum
sensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter,
by exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we
demonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This
dual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves
both as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of
signal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing
architectures.

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for
individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of
dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been
explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle
with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly
reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge,
quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering
faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims
to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the
performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary
classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of
noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness
of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can
transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for
biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on
advancing healthcare technology.

Abstract: Solitons - localized wave packets that travel without spreading - play a
central role in understanding transport and properties of nonlinear systems,
from optical fibers to fluid dynamics. In quantum many-body systems, however,
such robust excitations are typically destroyed by thermalization. Here, we
theoretically demonstrate the existence of solitonic excitations in high-energy
states of Rydberg atom chains in the regime of strong nearest-neighbor Rydberg
blockade. These localized wave packets propagate directionally atop a special
class of reviving initial states related to quantum many-body scars and are
capable of carrying energy. Exhibiting long coherence times, these states
constitute a novel type of non-ergodic quantum dynamics and can be efficiently
implemented on Rydberg atom simulators. In addition to a phenomenological
description of solitons, we identify their counterpart in a classical nonlinear
dynamical system obtained from a variational projection of the quantum
dynamics. We demonstrate the potential use of solitons in quantum information
transfer and conjecture their relevance for the anomalous energy transport
reported in numerical studies of Rydberg atom arrays.

Result: 实验表明SpoQFL在性能和收敛稳定性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: SpoQFL有效解决了量子噪声异质性问题，提升了量子联邦学习的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines
quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model
training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum
noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices
experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and
sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training
performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework
that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in
distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies
based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability,
and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches,
achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks represent a promising frontier in
the search for improved machine learning models. This thesis explores the
integration of quantum layers within classical convolutional neural network
architectures, aiming to leverage quantum entanglement and feature mapping to

training such hybrid models is presented, using PyTorch and Qiskit Machine
Learning frameworks. Experiments investigate the performance impact of
inserting quantum layers at different stages of the neural network pipeline.
The results suggest that quantum components can introduce meaningful

made publicly available, and future work will focus on expanding experimental
evaluations and publishing additional findings.

Conclusion: 非高斯性是驱动非可积行为的关键资源，桥接了自由和相互作用费米子系统的动力学。

Abstract: Free fermionic Gaussian, a.k.a. matchgate, random circuits exhibit atypical
behavior compared to generic interacting systems. They produce anomalously slow
entanglement growth, characterized by diffusive scaling $S(t) \sim \sqrt{t}$,
and evolve into volume-law entangled states at late times, $S \sim N$, which
are highly unstable to measurements. Here, we investigate how doping such
circuits with non-Gaussian resources (gates) restores entanglement structures
of typical dynamics. We demonstrate that ballistic entanglement growth $S(t)
\sim t$ is recovered after injecting an extensive total amount of non-Gaussian
gates, also restoring Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations. When the evolution is
perturbed with measurements, we uncover a measurement-induced phase transition
between an area-law and a power-law entangled phase, $S \sim N^\alpha$, with
$\alpha$ controlled by the doping. A genuine volume-law entangled phase is
recovered only when non-Gaussian gates are injected at an extensive rate. Our
findings bridge the dynamics of free and interacting fermionic systems,
identifying non-Gaussianity as a key resource driving the emergence of
non-integrable behavior.

### [9] [Unfolded distillation: very low-cost magic state preparation for biased-noise qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12511)
*Diego Ruiz,Jérémie Guillaud,Christophe Vuillot,Mazyar Mirrahimi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本的魔法态蒸馏方案，适用于偏置噪声量子比特，显著降低了电路体积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 魔法态蒸馏虽然能实现通用容错量子计算，但空间和时间开销较大，因此需要更高效的方案。

Method: 利用噪声偏置，通过展开Hadamard 3D量子Reed-Muller码的X稳定子群在2D中实现物理级蒸馏。

Result: 在噪声偏置η≳5×10^6和相位翻转噪声率0.1%下，仅需53个量子比特和5.5轮纠错，逻辑错误率低至3×10^-7。

Conclusion: 该方案显著优于传统方法，尤其在噪声偏置较低或相位翻转率较高时仍保持高效。

Abstract: Magic state distillation enables universal fault-tolerant quantum computation
by implementing non-Clifford gates via the preparation of high-fidelity magic
states. However, it comes at the cost of substantial logical-level overhead in
both space and time. In this work, we propose a very low-cost magic state
distillation scheme for biased-noise qubits. By leveraging the noise bias, our
scheme enables the preparation of a magic state with a logical error rate of $3
\times 10^{-7}$, using only 53 qubits and 5.5 error correction rounds, under a
noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 5 \times 10^6$ and a phase-flip noise rate of
$0.1\%$. This reduces the circuit volume by more than one order of magnitude
relative to magic state cultivation for unbiased-noise qubits and by more than
two orders of magnitude relative to standard magic state distillation.
Moreover, our scheme provides three key advantages over previous proposals for
biased-noise qubits. First, it only requires nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates
on a 2D lattice. Second, the logical fidelity remains nearly identical even at
a more modest noise bias of $\eta \gtrsim 80$, at the cost of a slightly
increased circuit volume. Third, the scheme remains effective even at high
physical phase-flip rates, in contrast to previously proposed approaches whose
circuit volume grows exponentially with the error rate. Our construction is
based on unfolding the $X$ stabilizer group of the Hadamard 3D quantum
Reed-Muller code in 2D, enabling distillation at the physical level rather than
the logical level, and is therefore referred to as $\textit{unfolded}$
distillation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了线性深度顺序酉电路（SU）和常数深度测量反馈电路（MF）在制备长程纠缠量子态中的对偶性，并通过时空旋转展示了其应用。

Result: 展示了SU和MF电路的对偶性，并提出了实验协议以测量一维多体态的非传统性质。

Conclusion: 时空对偶性为量子态制备和测量提供了新视角，并可能对研究对称性和拓扑相产生深远影响。

Abstract: Two prevalent approaches for preparing long-range entangled quantum states
are (i) linear-depth sequential unitary (SU) circuits, which apply local
unitary gates sequentially, and (ii) constant-depth measurement-feedback (MF)
circuits, which employ mid-circuit measurements and conditional feedback based
on measurement outcomes. Here, we establish that a broad class of SU and MF
circuits are dual to each other under a spacetime rotation. We investigate this
spacetime duality in the preparation of various long-range entangled states,
including GHZ states, topologically ordered states, and fractal
symmetry-breaking states. As an illustration, applying a spacetime rotation to
a linear-depth SU circuit that implements a non-invertible Kramers-Wannier
duality, originally used to prepare a 1D GHZ state, yields a constant-depth MF
circuit that implements a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gauging map, which
equivalently prepares the GHZ state. Leveraging this duality, we further
propose experimental protocols that require only a constant number of qubits to
measure unconventional properties of 1D many-body states. These include (i)
measurement of disorder operators, which diagnose the absence of spontaneous
symmetry breaking, and (ii) postselection-free detection of measurement-induced
long-range order, which emerges in certain symmetry-protected topological
phases. We also show that measurement-induced long-range order provides a lower
bound for strange correlators, which may be of independent interest.

Conclusion: 魔法与纠缠不同，可能不会突然消失，其行为与临界现象密切相关。

Abstract: We study the behavior of magic as a bipartite correlation in the quantum
Ising chain across its quantum phase transition, and at finite temperature. In
order to quantify the magic of partitions rigorously, we formulate a hybrid
scheme that combines stochastic sampling of reduced density matrices via
quantum Monte Carlo, with state-of-the-art estimators for the robustness of
magic - a {\it bona fide} measure of magic for mixed states. This allows us to
compute the mutual robustness of magic for partitions up to 8 sites, embedded
into a much larger system. We show how mutual robustness is directly related to
critical behaviors: at the critical point, it displays a power law decay as a
function of the distance between partitions, whose exponent is related to the
partition size. Once finite temperature is included, mutual magic retains its
low temperature value up to an effective critical temperature, whose dependence
on size is also algebraic. This suggests that magic, differently from
entanglement, does not necessarily undergo a sudden death.

Conclusion: 统一处理揭示了量子到经典过渡的机制，为实验实现提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Quantum-to-classical transition for finite-dimensional systems is widely
considered to occur continuously, yet the mechanism underlying the intermediate
stage remains unclear. In this work, we address this challenge by adopting an
operational framework to bridge discrete generalized coherent state
positive-operator-valued measurements and continuous isotropic depolarizing
channels. Our unified treatment reveals how dimensionality and decoherence rate
collectively govern the quantum-to-classical transition. Notably, we
demonstrate that a single-shot generalized measurement can eliminate most
negative quasi-probabilities in phase space for finite-dimensional systems.
Furthermore, we propose quantum circuit implementations achievable with current
state-of-the-art quantum technologies.

Conclusion: 该方法为离散变量码的自主量子纠错提供了新思路，并可能推动传统测量反馈纠错和容错量子操作的发展。

Abstract: Dissipative quantum error correction (QEC) autonomously protects quantum
information using engineered dissipation and offers a promising alternative to
error correction via measurement and feedback. However, scalability remains a
challenge, as correcting high-weight errors typically requires increasing
dissipation rates and exponentially many correction operators. Here, we present
a scalable dissipative QEC protocol for discrete-variable codes, correcting
multi-qubit errors via a trickle-down mechanism that sequentially reduces
errors weight. Our construction exploits redundancy in the Knill-Laflamme
conditions to design correction operators that act on multiple error subspaces
simultaneously, thereby reducing the overhead from exponential to polynomial in
the number of required operators. We illustrate our approach with repetition
codes under biased noise, showing a fourfold improvement in the exponential
suppression factor at realistic physical error rates. Our approach connects
autonomous QEC for discrete-variable codes with demonstrated dissipative
protocols for bosonic codes and opens up new avenues for traditional
measurement-feedback QEC and fault-tolerant quantum operations.

Abstract: Current quantum annealing experiments often suffer from restrictions in
connectivity in the sense that only certain qubits can be coupled to each
other. The most common strategy to overcome connectivity restrictions so far is
by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit with higher
connectivity, which is achieved by adding terms to the Hamiltonian.
Practically, this strategy is implemented by finding a so-called minor
embedding, which is in itself an NP-hard problem. In this work, we present an
iterative algorithm that does not need additional qubits but instead
efficiently uses the available connectivity for different parts of the problem
graph in every step. We present a weak monotonicity proof and benchmark our
algorithm against the default minor-embedding algorithm on the D-Wave quantum
annealer and multiple simple local search variants. While most of the
experiments to compare the different iterative methods are performed with
simulated annealing solvers, we also confirm the practicality of our method
with experiments on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer.

Abstract: Quantum networks hold promise for key distribution, private and distributed
computing, and quantum sensing, among other applications. The scale of such
networks for ground users is currently limited by one's ability to distribute
entanglement between distant locations. This can in principle be carried out by
transmitting entangled photons through optical fibers or satellites. The former
is limited by fiber optic attenuation while the latter is limited by
atmospheric extinction and diffraction. Here, we propose a hybrid network and
protocol that outperform both ground- and satellite-based designs and lead to
high-fidelity entanglement at a continental or even global scale.

with the experimental state. The tensor optimization is carried out
sequentially, similarly to the well-known density matrix renormalization group
algorithm. Our approach is provably efficient under certain technical
conditions which are expected to be met in short-range correlated states and in
typical noisy experimental settings. Under the same conditions, we also provide
an efficient scheme to estimate fidelities between the learned and the
experimental states. We experimentally demonstrate our protocol by learning
entangled quantum states of up to $N = 96$ qubits in a superconducting quantum
processor. Our method upgrades classical shadows to large-scale quantum
computation and simulation experiments.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of quantum systems is essential for the development
of quantum technologies, particularly in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) era. While traditional methods for Hamiltonian learning and noise
characterization often require extensive measurements and scale poorly with
system size, machine learning approaches offer promising alternatives. In this
work, we extend the inverse physics-informed neural network (referred to as
PINNverse) framework to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad master
equations. By incorporating both coherent and dissipative dynamics into the
neural network training, our method enables simultaneous identification of
Hamiltonian parameters and decay rates from noisy experimental data. We
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach through numerical
simulations of two-qubit open systems. Our results show that PINNverse provides
a scalable and noise-resilient framework for quantum system identification,
with potential applications in quantum control and error mitigation.

Motivation: 高效的量子算术操作是复杂量子算法的关键组成部分，但现有理论设计在实际量子编程框架中的实现较少。

Method: 采用Qrisp框架，基于可逆加法器、减法器和条件逻辑块等模块化组件，实现了三阶段算法。

Result: 验证了理论资源估计，T-count为14n-14，T-depth为5n+3，实验测试结果准确。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了资源优化量子算术算法的实际可行性，为现代量子编程框架中的算术操作实现奠定了基础。

Abstract: Efficient quantum arithmetic operations are essential building blocks for
complex quantum algorithms, yet few theoretical designs have been implemented
in practical quantum programming frameworks. This paper presents the first
complete implementation of the T-count optimized non-restoring quantum square
root algorithm using the Qrisp quantum programming framework. The algorithm,
originally proposed by Thapliyal et al., offers better resource efficiency
compared to alternative methods, achieving reduced T-count and qubit
requirements while avoiding garbage output. Our implementation validates the
theoretical resource estimates, confirming a T-count of 14n-14 and T-depth of
5n+3 for n-bit inputs. The modular design approach enabled by Qrisp allows
construction from reusable components including reversible adders, subtractors,
and conditional logic blocks built from fundamental quantum gates. The
three-stage algorithm - comprising initial subtraction, iterative conditional
addition/subtraction, and remainder restoration is successfully translated from
algorithmic description to executable quantum code. Experimental validation
across multiple test cases confirms correctness, with the circuit producing
accurate integer square roots and remainders. This work demonstrates the
practical realizability of resource-optimized quantum arithmetic algorithms and
establishes a foundation for implementing different arithmetic operations in
modern quantum programming frameworks.

Motivation: 优化CVD过程中TAH的排序问题，同时探索量子计算在这一领域的潜在优势。

Method: 扩展Sridhara的多项式根公式，采用Hartree-Fock哈密顿量和STO-3G基组，结合压缩算法和VQE进行分子能量排序。

Result: 算法将VQE模拟速度提升十倍，误差降至10^-1量级，矩阵压缩能力达(1-2^-k)·100%。

Conclusion: 该方法为克服大规模量子处理单元的电路尺寸和噪声限制提供了新工具。

Abstract: Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the most efficient process to synthesize
graphene sheets using methane as precursor, making it a strategic alternative
route for the Liquefied Natural Gas market. In this reaction, tetracyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (TAH) are produced as residual and intermediary
molecules. Sorting a combinatorial space of variants of TAHs by energy is a
poorly studied problem needed to optimize CVD, while it is also a candidate for
quantum advantage in quantum computers. We extend on Sridhara's polynomial root
formula to perform block-diagonalization (hence SBD) of six TAHs using
Hartree-Fock Hamiltonians with STO-3G basis set and active orbital space
growing from 2 to 6 orbitals, with equal numbers for the number of active
electrons. We show that the proposed compression algorithm followed by
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) allows for sorting of the molecules by
ground state energy, while speeding up the VQE simulation up to tenfold and
reducing its error to the $10^{-1}$ scale. The compression capability of
$(1-2^{-k})\cdot 100\%$ in matrix size for $k$ qubits allows VQEs to have a
broader set of applications, providing a new and necessary tool to overcome the
circuit size and quantum noise limitations of large quantum processing units.

Result: 在线性响应和零温条件下获得解析结果，证明boxcar传输函数在所有参数范围内对电流测量最优。

Conclusion: 电流测量方法在开放量子系统中具有潜力，boxcar传输函数为最优选择。

Abstract: The traditional approach to quantum parameter estimation focuses on the
quantum state, deriving fundamental bounds on precision through the quantum
Fisher information. In most experimental settings, however, performing
arbitrary quantum measurements is highly unfeasible. In open quantum systems,
an alternative approach to metrology involves the measurement of stochastic
currents flowing from the system to its environment. However, the present
understanding of current-based metrology is mostly limited to Markovian master
equations. Considering a parameter estimation problem in a two-terminal
mesoscopic conductor, we identify the key elements that determine estimation
precision within the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Crucially, this approach
allows us to address arbitrary coupling and temperature regimes. Furthermore,
we obtain analytical results for the precision in linear-response and
zero-temperature regimes. For the specific parameter estimation task that we
consider, we demonstrate that the boxcar transmission function is optimal for
current-based metrology in all parameter regimes.

Conclusion: 本文为小规模量子系统提供了完整的扇区长度描述工具，但大规模系统的复杂性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Multipartite quantum systems are subject to monogamy relations that impose
fundamental constraints on the distribution of quantum correlations between
subsystems. These constraints can be studied quantitatively through sector
lengths, defined as the average value of $m$-body correlations, which have
applications in quantum information theory and coding theory. In this work, we
derive a set of monogamy inequalities that complement the shadow inequalities,
enabling a complete characterization of the numerical range of sector lengths
for systems with $N\leq 5$ qubits in a pure state. This range forms a convex
polytope, facilitating the efficient extremization of key physical quantities,
such as the linear entropy of entanglement and the quantum shadow enumerators,
by a simple evaluation at the polytope vertices. For larger systems ($N\geq
6$), we highlight a significant increase in complexity that neither our
inequalities nor the shadow inequalities can fully capture.

Abstract: Superinductors are circuit elements characterised by an intrinsic impedance
in excess of the superconducting resistance quantum
($R_\text{Q}\approx6.45~$k$\Omega$), with applications from metrology and
sensing to quantum computing. However, they are typically obtained using exotic
materials with high density inductance such as Josephson junctions,
superconducting nanowires or twisted two-dimensional materials. Here, we
present a superinductor realised within a silicon integrated circuit (IC),
exploiting the high kinetic inductance ($\sim 1$~nH/$\square$) of TiN thin
films native to the manufacturing process (22-nm FDSOI). By interfacing the
superinductor to a silicon quantum dot formed within the same IC, we
demonstrate a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rfSET), the most
widely used sensor in semiconductor-based quantum computers. The integrated
nature of the rfSET reduces its parasitics which, together with the high
impedance, yields a sensitivity improvement of more than two orders of
magnitude over the state-of-the-art, combined with a 10,000-fold area
reduction. Beyond providing the basis for dense arrays of integrated and
high-performance qubit sensors, the realization of high-kinetic-inductance
superconducting devices integrated within modern silicon ICs opens many
opportunities, including kinetic-inductance detector arrays for astronomy and
the study of metamaterials and quantum simulators based on 1D and 2D resonator
arrays.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we present another new thermal scalar and vector gauge
potentials implemented by the quantum Boltzmann equation, which originates from
the interaction of conduction electrons and phonons. To accomplish this task,
we derive a temperature dependent four dimensional damping force by the Taylor
series expansion on the self energy of the QBE, which can be related to the
thermal scalar and vector gauge potentials, especially the fourth component of
the damping force, which is just a power corresponding to a new scalar
potential. Based on the local equilibrium assumption, we solve the QBE order by
order using the Fourier transformation method. The temperature dependent
damping force and other physical observables are exhibited in the figures, the
higher of the temperature, the bigger of the damping force.

Abstract: Improving quantum algorithms run-time performance involves several strategies
such as reducing the quantum gate counts, decreasing the number of
measurements, advancement in QPU technology for faster gate operations, or
optimizing the classical processing. This work focuses on the latter,
specifically reducing classical processing and compilation time via
hardware-assisted parameterized circuit execution (PCE) for computing dynamical
properties of quantum systems. PCE was previously validated for QCVV protocols,
which leverages structural circuit equivalencies. We demonstrate the
applicability of this approach to computing dynamical properties of quantum
many-body systems using structurally equivalent time evolution circuits,
specifically calculating correlation functions of spin models using
constant-depth circuits generated via Cartan decomposition. Implementing this
for spin-spin correlation functions in Transverse field XY (up to 6-sites) and
Heisenberg spin models (up to 3-sites), we observed a run-time reduction of up
to 50\% compared to standard compilation methods. This highlights the
adaptability of time-evolution circuit with hardware-assisted PCE to
potentially mitigate the classical bottlenecks in near-term quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Reliable detection and quantification of quantum entanglement, particularly
in high-spin or many-body systems, present significant computational challenges
for traditional methods. This study examines the effectiveness of ensemble
machine learning models as a reliable and scalable approach for estimating
entanglement, measured by negativity, in quantum systems. We construct an
ensemble regressor integrating Neural Networks (NNs), XGBoost (XGB), and Extra
Trees (ET), trained on datasets of pure states and mixed Werner states for
various spin dimensions. The ensemble model with stacking meta-learner
demonstrates robust performance by CatBoost (CB), accurately predicting
negativity across different dimensionalities and state types. Crucially, visual
analysis of prediction scatter plots reveals that the ensemble model exhibits
superior predictive consistency and lower deviation from true entanglement
values compared to individual strong learners like NNs, even when aggregate
metrics are comparable. This enhanced reliability, attributed to error
cancellation and variance reduction inherent in ensembling, underscores the
potential of this approach to bypass computational bottlenecks and provide a
trustworthy tool for characterizing entanglement in high-dimensional quantum
physics. An empirical formula for estimating data requirements based on system
dimensionality and desired accuracy is also derived.

Abstract: Noise is inevitable in realistic quantum circuits. It arises randomly in
space. Inspired by spatial non-uniformity of the noise, we investigate the
effects of spatial modulation on purification phase transitions in a hybrid
random Clifford circuit. As an efficient observable for extracting quantum
entanglement in mixed states, we employ many-body negativity. The behavior of
the many-body negativity well characterizes the presence of the purification
phase transitions and its criticality. We find the effect of spatial
non-uniformity in measurement probability on purification phase transition. The
criticality of the purification phase transition changes from that of uniform
probability, which is elucidated from the argument of the Harris criterion. The
critical correlation length exponent $\nu$ changes from $\nu < 2$ for uniform
probability to $\nu > 2$ for spatially modulated probability. We further
investigate a setting where two-site random Clifford gate becomes spatially
(quasi-)modulated. We find that the modulation induces a phase transition,
leading to a different pure phase where a short-range quantum entanglement
remains.

Abstract: Conventional spectral probes of quantum chaos require eigenvalues, and
sometimes, eigenvectors of the quantum Hamiltonian. This involves
computationally expensive diagonalization procedures. We test whether an
unsupervised neural network can detect quantum chaos directly from the
Hamiltonian matrix. We use a single-body Hamiltonian with an underlying random
graph structure and random coupling constants, with a parameter that determines
the randomness of the graph. The spectral analysis shows that increasing the
amount of randomness in the underlying graph results in a transition from
integrable spectral statistics to chaotic ones. We show that the same
transition can be detected via unsupervised neural networks, or more
specifically, Self-Organizing Maps by feeding the Hamiltonian matrix directly
into the neural network, without any diagonalization procedure.

Abstract: Four-component Schr\"odinger cat states, superpositions of four coherent
states symmetrically arranged in phase space, offer rich nonclassical features
and enhanced resilience to decoherence, making them promising resources for
quantum information science. We propose a Floquet-engineered scheme to
deterministically generate four-component Schr\"odinger cat states in a hybrid
quantum system composed of two superconducting qubits, a microwave cavity, and
a magnon mode. By applying periodic transverse drives to the qubits, we derive
an effective Hamiltonian that conditionally displaces the magnon mode depending
on the joint qubit state. Conditional measurements in the $\sigma_x$ basis
project the magnon mode into nonclassical four-component cat states with high
fidelity. The Wigner functions in the original frame verified the
non-classicality of the four-component Schr\"odinger cat states. Results of
systematically analyzing the impacts of qubit decoherence, magnon loss, and
cavity dissipation demonstrate the robustness to the dissipation. The results
show that this scheme can realize the generation of multi-component quantum
superposition states in a scalable solid-state platform, providing a new
approach for hybrid quantum information processing based on nonclassical magnon

Abstract: The evolution of quantum states of light in free-space channels is strongly
influenced by atmospheric turbulence, posing a significant challenge for
quantum communication. The transmittance in such channels randomly fluctuates.
This effect is commonly described by the probability distribution of
transmittance (PDT). The elliptic-beam approximation provides an analytical
model for the PDT, showing good agreement with experimental and simulation data
within a specific range of channel parameters. In this work, we introduce the
circular-beam approximation -- a simplified alternative that offers
satisfactory accuracy while significantly reducing computational complexity. We
also present an alternative technique for evaluating the parameters of this
model based on the first two moments of transmittance. This approach notably
extends the applicability range of our PDT model, offering a practical tool for
characterizing atmospheric channels in quantum applications.

Abstract: Harnessing quantum resources in the atomic external degrees of
freedom--particularly matter-wave states with broad momentum spreads--holds
significant potential for enhancing the sensitivity of Kasevich-Chu atom
gravimeters at the standard quantum limit. However, a fully quantum-mechanical
investigation of the critical Doppler effect inherent to this approach remains
lacking. Employing the SU(2) Lie group theory, we derive a generic Riccati
equation governing the unitary dynamics of the Rabi model within a linear
potential and analyze the Doppler effect impact on Rabi oscillations because of
the strong coupling between the internal and external states. Furthermore, by
integrating Fisher information theory, we specifically demonstrate the
near-universality and high metrological gain of phase rotation measurement
protocols under strong Doppler broadening. This theoretical work provides
insightful implications for boarder generalization, such as extensions to
finite-temperature scenarios or multi-pulse sequences--exemplified by the
$\pi/2-\pi-\pi/2$ pulse sequence characteristic of Kasevich-Chu atom
gravimeters. Thus, this work lays a theoretical foundation for developing
high-sensitivity, noise-resistant atom gravimeters leveraging external-state

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，并与现有最优QLS工具进行了对比。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证最优性的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Quantum Layout Synthesis (QLS) maps a logical quantum circuit to a physical
quantum platform. Optimal QLS minimizes circuit size and depth, which is
essential to reduce the noise on current quantum platforms. Optimal QLS is an
NP-hard problem, so in practice, one maps a quantum circuit to a subset of the
complete quantum platform. However, to guarantee optimality, one still has to
consider exponentially many subarchitectures.
  We introduce an effective method to enumerate relevant subarchitectures. This
reduces the number of considered subarchitectures, as well as the number of
expensive subgraph isomorphism checks, thus boosting Optimal QLS with
subarchitectures. To do so, we assume a fixed number of ancilla qubits that can
be used in the mapping. We guarantee optimality of the quantum layout, for the
selected ancilla bound.
  We evaluate our technique on a number of benchmarks and compare it with
state-of-the-art Optimal QLS tools with and without using subarchitectures.

Abstract: We perform free-fall experiments with a charge-neutral, optically levitated
nanoparticle. This is achieved using an optical tweezer that can be rapidly
toggled on and off and vertically displaced, enabling the particle to be
released and recaptured after each free fall. The particle is insensitive to
electric fields due to its charge neutrality and, during free evolution, is not
subject to photon recoil heating. We achieve free-fall durations of up to 0.25
ms and observe a nearly two hundred-fold increase in the particle's position
uncertainty at recapture. The current limit on the free-fall time arises from
the performance of the initial cooling step. By implementing linear feedback
techniques and reducing the background pressure, we expect to perform
millisecond-scale free-fall experiments in ultra-high vacuum, opening new
opportunities for generating large delocalizations of levitated objects.

Abstract: We present a modular interpreter for PyTheus-optimized quantum networks that
automatically analyzes and visualizes complex quantum architectures discovered
through automated optimization. The interpreter addresses the critical
challenge of understanding machine-designed quantum networks by providing
robust algorithms for functional role identification, graph-theoretical
analysis, and physically meaningful visualization across the major classes of
PyTheus-generated networks. Our interpreter accepts both file-based and
in-memory network representations, automatically identifies sources, detectors,
beam splitters, and ancillas through priority-based classification, and
generates coordinated native graph plots and optical table representations. We
demonstrate the interpreter's capabilities through two complementary
approaches: (1) analysis of a newly developed five-node quantum key
distribution network that reveals distributed source architecture and dual-role
node functionality, and (2) comprehensive validation using existing PyTheus
examples including W4 state generation, heralded Bell state preparation, and
GHZ state networks. The interpreter successfully handles complex connectivity
patterns across diverse quantum network architectures within the tested
classes, avoids visualization artifacts, and provides validation mechanisms for
architectural consistency. Our primary contribution is the development of
robust modular interpretation algorithms that can analyze the major classes of
PyTheus-generated quantum networks, enabling better understanding of automated
quantum architecture design.

Abstract: The classical Kramers-Henneberger transformation connects, via a series of
unitary transformations, the dynamics of a quantum particle of mass $m$ located
in a trap at position $\alpha(t)$, with the dynamics of a charge $e$ moving in
an electric field $e{\cal{E}}(t)=-m\ddot{\alpha}(t)$ within the dipole
approximation. In this paper, we extend the classical Kramers-Henneberger
transformation to the quantum electrodynamic and quantum optical realm, by
explicitly treating the trap location quantum mechanically, thus taking into
account the quantum fluctuations of the time-dependent displacement force.
Compared to the classical case, we show that quantum electrodynamic corrections
appear, and we propose an optomechanical realization for the quantized position
of the trap to show that such corrections can manifest in state-of-the-art
experiments. These results open the path to novel quantum simulation of quantum
electrodynamics and quantum optics of attoscience and ultrafast physics by
using ultracold trapped atoms and ions.

Abstract: Preserving entanglement in the presence of decoherence remains a major
challenge for quantum technologies. Recent proposals [M.A. Selim et al.,
Science 387, 1424 (2025)] have employed photonic filters based on
anti-parity-time symmetry to recover certain entangled states, but these
approaches require intricate, symmetry-constrained waveguide architectures and
precise bath engineering. In this work, we show that such strict non-Hermitian
symmetry constraints are not necessary for entanglement filtering. Instead, we
identify post-selection and the emergence of dark states -- arising naturally
through destructive interference in simple photonic settings -- as the
essential mechanisms. By avoiding the need for special bath engineering or
non-Hermitian symmetries, our approach significantly simplifies the design and
architecture, enhances universality, and extends applicability beyond
previously studied dimer configurations. We demonstrate this concept using
minimal waveguide network designs, offering a broadly accessible route to
robust entanglement filtering.

Abstract: We consider the geometry of quantum states associated with classes of random
matrix Hamiltonians, in particular ensembles that show integrability to chaotic
transition in terms of the nearest neighbour energy level spacing distribution.
In the case that the total Hamiltonian contains a single parameter, the
distance between two states is captured by the fidelity susceptibility,
whereas, when the total Hamiltonian contains multiple parameters, this distance
is given by the quantum metric tensor. Since the fieldity susceptibility is
closely related to the two-point correlation function, we first calculate the
relevant correlation functions of a random matrix belonging to the Gaussian
unitary ensemble in terms of the spectral form factor of the total Hamiltonian,
show how to obtain the fidelity susceptibility from this correlation function,
and explain the role played by energy level correlation. Next, by performing
suitable coordinate transformations, we solve the geodesic equations
corresponding to the quantum metric tensor obtained from an
integrability-breaking random matrix Hamiltonian and obtain the geodesic
distance between two points on the parameter manifold to show that any point
far away from the integrable phase can be reached by a finite value of this
distance. Finally, we obtain and discuss different properties of the fidelity
susceptibility associated with Hamiltonians belonging to another random matrix
ensemble which shows integrability to chaos transition, namely the Gaussian
$\beta$-ensembles with general values of the Dyson index $\beta$, and show that
the fidelity susceptibility shares generic features with the first class of
Hamiltonians.

Abstract: Standard quantum mechanics predicts the non-conservation of state norms and
probability when the fundamental requirement of the Hermiticity of the
Hamiltonian is relaxed. Biorthogonal quantum mechanics, or the more general
metric formalism, provides a rigorous formulation of non-Hermitian quantum
mechanics wherein norms and probabilities are conserved. The key feature is
that the Hilbert space is endowed with a non-trivial dynamical metric. Beyond
theoretical considerations, the physical implementation of the metric formalism
remains unaddressed. In this work, we propose novel operator dilation schemes,
which show that the self-consistent non-Hermitian quantum mechanics can be
accessed in physical platforms via an embedding in closed Hermitian systems.
Using digital quantum simulators, we present a proof of principle and the first
experimental evidence for the dynamical metric engendered by non-Hermiticity in
a qubit. Our work ushers in a new paradigm in the quantum simulation of
non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: Mechanical qubits offer unique advantages over other qubit platforms,
primarily in terms of coherence time and possibilities for enhanced sensing
applications, but their potential is constrained by the inherently weak
nonlinearities and small anharmonicity of nanomechanical resonators. We propose
to overcome this shortcoming by using squeezed Fock states of phonons in a
parametrically driven nonlinear mechanical oscillator. We find that, under
two-phonon driving, squeezed Fock states become eigenstates of a Kerr-nonlinear
mechanical oscillator, featuring an energy spectrum with exponentially enhanced
and tunable anharmonicity, such that the transitions to higher energy states
are exponentially suppressed. This enables us to encode the mechanical qubit
within the ground and first excited squeezed Fock states of the driven
mechanical oscillator. This kind of mechanical qubit is termed mechanical
squeezed-Fock qubit. We also show that our mechanical qubit can serve as a
quantum sensor for weak forces, with its resulting sensitivity increased by at
least one order of magnitude over that of traditional mechanical qubits. The
proposed mechanical squeezed-Fock qubit provides a powerful quantum phonon
platform for quantum sensing and information processing.

Abstract: Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) are key components in quantum
information processing due to their ability to amplify weak quantum signals
with near-quantum-limited noise performance. This is essential for applications
such as qubit readout, quantum sensing, and communication, where signal
fidelity and coherence preservation are critical. Unlike CMOS and HEMT
amplifiers used in conventional RF systems, JPAs are specifically optimized for
millikelvin (mK) cryogenic environments. CMOS amplifiers offer good integration
but perform poorly at ultra-low temperatures due to high noise. HEMT amplifiers
provide better noise performance but are power-intensive and less suited for mK
operation. JPAs, by contrast, combine low power consumption with ultra-low
noise and excellent cryogenic compatibility, making them ideal for quantum
systems. The first part of this study compares these RF amplifier types and
explains why JPAs are preferred in cryogenic quantum applications. The second
part focuses on the design and analysis of JPAs based on both single Josephson
junctions and junction arrays. While single-junction JPAs utilize nonlinear
inductance for amplification, they suffer from gain compression, limited
dynamic range, and sensitivity to fabrication variations. To overcome these
challenges, this work explores JPA designs using Josephson junction arrays.
Arrays distribute the nonlinear response, enhancing power handling, linearity,
impedance tunability, and coherence while reducing phase noise. Several
advanced JPA architectures are proposed, simulated, and compared using quantum
theory and CAD tools to assess performance trade-offs and improvements over
conventional designs.

Conclusion: 观察到的引力诱导纠缠现象需要引力场具有非经典特性。

Abstract: There has been a wave of recent interest in detecting the quantum nature of
gravity with table-top experiments that witness gravitationally mediated
entanglement. Central to these proposals is the assumption that any mediator
capable of generating entanglement must itself be nonclassical. However,
previous arguments for this have modelled classical mediators as finite,
discrete systems such as bits, which excludes physically relevant continuous
and infinite-dimensional systems such as those of classical mechanics and field
theory. In this work, we close this gap by modelling classical systems as
commutative unital C*-algebras, arguably encompassing all potentially
physically relevant classical systems. We show that these systems cannot
mediate entanglement between two quantum systems A and B, even if A and B are
themselves infinite-dimensional or described by arbitrary unital C*-algebras
(as in Quantum Field Theory), composed with an arbitrary C*-tensor product.
This result reinforces the conclusion that the observation of gravity-induced
entanglement would require the gravitational field to possess inherently
non-classical features.

Abstract: Measuring global quantum properties -- such as the fidelity to complex
multipartite states -- is both an essential and experimentally challenging
task. Classical shadow estimation offers favorable sample complexity, but
typically relies on many-qubit circuits that are difficult to realize on
current platforms. We propose the robust phase shadow scheme, a measurement
framework based on random circuits with controlled-Z as the unique entangling
gate type, tailored to architectures such as trapped ions and neutral atoms.
Leveraging tensor diagrammatic reasoning, we rigorously analyze the induced
circuit ensemble and show that phase shadows match the performance of full
Clifford-based ones. Importantly, our approach supports a noise-robust
extension via purely classical post-processing, enabling reliable estimation
under realistic, gate-dependent noise where existing techniques often fail.
Additionally, by exploiting structural properties of random stabilizer states,
we design an efficient post-processing algorithm that resolves a key
computational bottleneck in previous shadow protocols. Our results enhance the
practicality of shadow-based techniques, providing a robust and scalable route
for estimating global properties in noisy quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum optics and atomic systems are prominent platforms for exploiting
quantum-enhanced precision in parameter estimation. However, not only are
quantum optical and atomic systems often treated separately, but even within
quantum optics, identifying optimal probes (quantum states) and evolutions
(parameter-dependent dynamics) typically relies on case-by-case analyses. Mode,
and sometimes only particle entanglement, can yield quantum enhancement of
precision in continuous- and discrete-variable regimes, yet a clear connection
between these regimes remains elusive. In this work, we present a unified
framework for quantum metrology that encompasses all known precision-enhancing
regimes using bosonic resources. We introduce a superselection rule compliant
representation of the electromagnetic field that explicitly incorporates the
phase reference, enforcing total particle number conservation. This approach
provides a description of the electromagnetic field which is formally
equivalent to the one employed in atomic systems, and we show how it
encompasses both the discrete and the continuous limits of quantum optics.
Within this framework, we consistently recover established results while
offering a coherent physical interpretation of the quantum resources
responsible for precision enhancement. Moreover, we develop general strategies
to optimize precision using arbitrary multimode entangled probe states.
Finally, our formalism readily accommodates noise, measurement strategies and
non-unitary evolutions, extending its applicability to realistic experimental
scenarios.

Abstract: Substitutional nitrogen atoms in a diamond crystal (P1 centers) are, on one
hand, a resource for creation of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, that have been
widely employed as nanoscale quantum sensors. On the other hand, P1's electron
spin is a source of paramagnetic noise that degrades the NV's performance by
shortening its coherence time. Accurate quantification of nitrogen
concentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum
devices. However, bulk characterization methods based on optical absorption or
electron paramagnetic resonance often overlook local variations in nitrogen
content. In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV
center ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low
concentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure
the local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per
billion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique.
Moreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed
to determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created
during the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation
dose.

Abstract: A quantum memory is an essential element for quantum computation, quantum
network and quantum metrology. Previously, a single-qubit quantum memory with a
coherence time of about an hour has been realized in a dual-species setup where
a coolant ion provides sympathetic cooling for a memory ion of different
species. However, the frequent random position hopping between the ions in the
room-temperature trap limits the technique there only applicable to
single-qubit storage. Here we report a multi-ion quantum memory in a cryogenic
trap based on the dual-type scheme, and demonstrate a coherence time above two
hours for a logical qubit encoded in the decoherence-free subspace, i.e.
two-ion entangled states, after correcting the dominant leakage error. Our
scheme alleviates the necessity of an ultra-stable frequency reference for the
stored qubit, and has a preferable scalability owing to the same mass of the
metastable-state memory ions and the ground-state coolant ion.

Abstract: We investigate the energy dynamics of a unitary Fermi gas driven away from
equilibrium. The energy is injected into the system by periodically modulating
the trapping potential of a spherical unitary Fermi gas, and due to the
existence of SO(2,1) symmetry, the breathing mode is excited without
dissipation. Through the long-lived breathing oscillation, we precisely measure
the energy evolution of the nonequilibrium system during the trap modulation.
We find the trapping potential and internal energies increase with modulation
time and simultaneously oscillate nearly $\textrm{180}^{\textrm{o}}$ out of
phase. At large modulation amplitudes, the energy-injection efficiency is
strongly reduced due to the trap anharmonicity. Unlike the equilibrium system,
the measured energy evolution agrees well with predictions of the dynamic
virial theorem. Our work provides valuable insights into the energy injection
and redistribution in a non-equilibrium system, paving a way for future
investigations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

Abstract: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that
captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals
observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential.
By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its
isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped
condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained
description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium
configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply
the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the
effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs
constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction
and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the
effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko
mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order
actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.

Abstract: Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given
lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total
number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical
problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter
physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the
eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the
theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative
method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large
graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As a condensed matter physics
application, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of
tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices. While the Archimedean
lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for
concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two-
or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices.

Abstract: We introduce a partial decidability protocol for the Wang tiling problem
(which is the prototype of undecidable problems in combinatorics and
statistical physics) by constructing a suitable mapping from tilings of finite
squares of different sizes. Such mapping depends on the initial family of Wang
tiles (the alphabet) with which one would like to tile the plane. This allows
to define effective entropy and temperature associated to the alphabet
(together with the corresponding partition function). We identify a subclass of
good alphabets by observing that when the entropy and temperature of a given
alphabet are well-behaved in the thermodynamical sense then such alphabet can
tile the infinite two-dimensional plane. Our proposal is tested successfully
with the known available good alphabets (which produce periodic tilings,
aperiodic but self-similar tilings as well as tilings which are neither
periodic nor self-similar). Our analysis shows that the Kendall Tau coefficient
is able to distinguish alphabets with a good thermodynamical behavior from
alphabets with bad thermodynamical behavior. The transition from good to
undecidable behavior is related to a transition from non-chaotic to chaotic
regime in discrete dynamical systems of logistic type.

Abstract: Complex free-energy landscapes with many local minima separated by large
barriers are believed to underlie glassy behavior across diverse physical
systems. This is the heuristic picture associated with replica symmetry
breaking (RSB) in spin glasses, but RSB has only been rigorously verified for
certain mean-field models with all-to-all connectivity. In this work, we give a
rigorous proof of finite temperature spin glass order for a family of models
with local interactions on finite-connectivity, non-Euclidean expander graphs.
To this end, we bypass the RSB formalism entirely, and instead exploit the
mathematical equivalence of such models to certain low-density parity check
(LDPC) codes. We use code expansion, a property of LDPC codes which guarantees
extensive energy barriers around ground states. Together with mild additional
assumptions, this allows us to construct an explicit decomposition of the
low-temperature Gibbs state into disjoint components, each hosting an
asymptotically long-lived state associated with a local minimum of the
landscape. Each component carries at most an exponentially small fraction of
the total weight, and almost all components do not contain ground states --
which we take together to define spin-glass order. The proof is elementary, and
treats various expanding graph topologies on the same footing, including those
with short loops where existing approaches such as the cavity method fail. Our
results apply rigorously to diluted p-spin glasses for sufficiently large p,
and while unproven, we also expect our assumptions to hold in a broader family
of codes. Motivated by this, we numerically study two simple models, on random
regular graphs and a regular tesselation of hyperbolic space. We show that both
models undergo two transitions as a function of temperature, corresponding to
the onset of weak ergodicity breaking and spin glass order, respectively.

Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite
groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of
our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to
projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology,
representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective
representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known
as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on
commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have
important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that
cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to
distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$
symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate
how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We
show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host
nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a
lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32
without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.

Conclusion: SLMC是一种高效且通用的框架，扩展了强关联电子系统的数值研究能力。

Abstract: The Self-Learning Monte Carlo (SLMC) method is a Monte Carlo approach that
has emerged in recent years by integrating concepts from machine learning with
conventional Monte Carlo techniques. Designed to accelerate the numerical study
of interacting many-body systems, SLMC significantly improves sampling
efficiency by constructing an effective model -- via machine learning methods
-- based on configurations generated by conventional Monte Carlo methods and
then proposes global updates based on the effective model. This enhancement
leads to a substantial reduction in autocorrelation time, especially near the
critical region, where traditional methods typically suffer from critical
slowing down and increased computation complexity. Moreover, SLMC maintains
statistical accuracy by implementing a cumulative update scheme that rigorously
satisfies the detailed balance condition. And more recent applications have
extended the SLMC to convolutional neural networks with applications not only
in condensed matter physics but also high-energy physics, quantum chemistry,
and quantum simulations. The generic applicability and high computational
efficiency make SLMC a powerful and scalable framework for quantum Monte Carlo
simulations of strongly correlated electron systems, extending the reach of
numerical investigations beyond the limitations of conventional techniques.

Conclusion: 研究扩展了多Q磁性相的分类，并为反常霍尔效应的机制提供了新的理解。

Abstract: The cobalt-intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Co$_x$TaS$_2$ hosts a
rich landscape of magnetic phases that depend sensitively on $x$. While the
stoichiometric compound with $x=1/3$ exhibits a single magnetic transition,
samples with $x\leq 0.325$ display two transitions with an anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) emerging in the lower temperature phase. Here, we resolve the spin
structure in each phase by employing a suite of magneto-optical probes that
include the discovery of anomalous magneto-birefringence -- a spontaneous
time-reversal sensitive rotation of the principal optic axes. A symmetry-based
analysis identifies the AHE-active phase as an anisotropic (2+1)\textbf{Q}
state, in which magnetic modulation at one wavevector (\textbf{Q}) differs in
symmetry from that at the remaining two. The (2+1)\textbf{Q} state naturally
exhibits scalar spin chirality as a mechanism for the AHE and expands the
classification of multi-Q magnetic phases.

Abstract: We investigate the crystal electric field (CEF) excitations of Yb$^{3+}$ ions
in powder samples of the triangular-lattice rare-earth-based antiferromagnet
YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ using inelastic neutron scattering (INS). Three CEF excitations
from the ground-state Kramers doublet were observed, each exhibiting
significant broadening beyond instrumental resolution. Combining
temperature-dependent INS and neutron powder diffraction, we identify a
significant static contribution to this broadening and attribute it to
heterogeneous coordination of Yb$^{3+}$ ions due to Ga$^{3+}$/Zn$^{2+}$ site
mixing. Rietveld refinement of neutron powder diffraction indicates that 35% of
Ga occupies the Zn site and 60% of Zn occupies the Ga site. We show with a
point charge model for the CEF Hamiltonian that heterogeneous coordination of
Yb$^{3+}$ ions leads to broadened CEF peaks. First-principles calculations
demonstrate that the random Ga$^{3+}$/Zn$^{2+}$ distribution can produce the
distortions of the YbO$_6$ octahedra observed from neutron diffraction. Because
the documented heterogeneity will extend to exchange interactions, our results
suggest that disorder is a significant factor in the unusual magnetism
previously reported in YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$, including broad low-energy magnetic
excitations and the absence of magnetic ordering down to 0.3K.

Abstract: The Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method has shown great
potential as a general-purpose quantum impurity solver, as its numerical errors
can be well-controlled and it is flexible to be applied on both the imaginary-
and real-time axis. However, a major limitation of it is that its computational
cost grows exponentially with the number of impurity flavors. In this work, we
propose a multi-flavor extension of it to overcome this limitation. The key
insight is that to calculate multi-time correlation functions on one or a few
impurity flavors, one could integrate out the degrees of freedom of the rest
flavors before hand, which could greatly simplify the calculation. The idea is
particularly effective for quantum impurity problems with diagonal
hybridization function, i.e., each impurity flavor is coupled to an independent
bath, a setting which is commonly used in the field. We demonstrate the
accuracy and scalability of our method for the imaginary time evolution of
impurity problems with up to three impurity orbitals, i.e., 6 flavors, and
benchmark our results against continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations.
Our method paves the way of scaling up tensor network algorithms to solve
large-scale quantum impurity problems.

Abstract: Spinel-structured compounds serve as prototypical examples of highly
frustrated systems, and are promising candidates for realizing the long-sought
quantum spin liquid (QSL) state. However, structural disorder is inevitable in
many real QSL candidates and its impact remains a topic of intense debate. In
this work, we conduct comprehensive investigations on CuGa$_2$O$_4$, a spinel
compound with significant structural disorder, focusing on its thermodynamic
properties and spectroscopic behaviors. No long-range magnetic order is
observed down to $\sim$80 mK, as evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, specific
heat and elastic neutron scattering measurements. More intriguingly, inelastic
neutron scattering experiments reveal a broad gapless continuum of magnetic
excitations around the Brillouin zone boundary, resembling the magnetic
excitation spectra expected for a QSL. Nevertheless, a spin-freezing transition
at $T_{\rm{f}} \approx $ 0.88 K is identified from the cusp in the dc
susceptibility curves, where a bifurcation between zero-field-cooling and
field-cooling curves occurs. Furthermore, ac susceptibility measurements show a
peak close to $T_{\rm{f}}$ at low frequency, which shifts to higher temperature
with increasing frequency. These results are evident that CuGa$_2$O$_4$ has
spin-glass ground state, consistent with the establishment of short-range order
inferred from the specific heat measurements. Collectively, these results
illustrate the crucial role of disorder in defining the excitation spectrum out
of the disordered ground state. Our findings shed light onto the broader class
of AB$_2$O$_4$ spinels and advance our understanding of the spin dynamics in
magnetically disordered systems.

Abstract: The heavy fermion compound CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ has recently shown to exhibit a

consistent with the lack of inversion symmetry that allows for the existence of

theory, which is state-of-the-art for such correlated materials, and study the
topology of CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$. We find five inequivalent Weyl nodes of either type
I or II, each having sixteen symmetry-related replicas. These Weyl nodes bridge
the Kondo insulating gap, which is a direct but not an indirect gap. The
closest Weyl points is only 0.5meV below the Fermi energy, and has a flat

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of nonlocal correlations on charge
fluctuations in the two-dimensional single-band Hubbard model close to the Mott
metal-to-insulator transition. At half-filling and for interaction strengths
and temperatures where the system is in the Mott insulating phase, charge
fluctuations are strongly suppressed. Under these conditions, dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations predict a strong enhancement of the
charge susceptibility at small (electron or hole) doping. However, these DMFT
results include only the effects of purely local correlations despite the
importance of nonlocal correlations in two-dimensional systems. We have, hence,
carried out dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) simulations which allow
for the inclusion of such nonlocal correlation effects while retaining the
local ones of DMFT. Our numerical data show that close to half-filling the
large uniform charge susceptibility of DMFT is strongly suppressed by nonlocal
fluctuations but gradually increases with (electron) doping. At a certain
doping value charge fluctuations become eventually larger in D$\Gamma$A with
respect to DMFT indicating that the absence of nonlocal correlations
underestimates the mobility of the charge carriers in this parameter regime.
This metallization effect is also reflected in an enhancement of the D$\Gamma$A
kinetic and potential energies and a corresponding reduction of the (absolute
value of the) D$\Gamma$A Matsubara self-energy with respect to DMFT.

magnetic field applied perpendicular to the light wave vector $\mathbf k$
(Voigt geometry). For the symmetry allowed geometry with the
$\mathbf{k}\parallel[111]$ crystal axes, the nonreciprocal dependence of the
SHG intensity on the magnetic field direction is found. It is explained by an
interference of the crystallographic and magnetic-field-induced SHG signals.
Relative phases of these signals are evaluated from the rotational anisotropy
diagrams. Phenomenological and microscopic models of the effect are developed.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental observation of the
nonreciprocal SHG in semiconductor crystals, and the first one for
exciton-polaritons.

Abstract: We report on the possibility of manipulating magnetic materials by using
itinerant orbital angular momentum to produce out-of-plane spin polarization in
van der Waals heterostructures. Employing a real-space formulation of the OAM
operator within linear response theory, we demonstrate that in low-symmetry
transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, such as 1$T{}_d$-MoTe2, the
current-induced itinerant OAM exceeds the spin response by three orders of
magnitude. When TMDs are coupled with ferromagnets with negligible intrinsic
orbital responses, the itinerant OAM generated by the orbital Rashba-Edelstein
effect transfers across the interface, generating spin densities capable of
inducing magnetization dynamics inside the ferromagnet. Our findings highlight
the previously overlooked role of itinerant OAM in the generation of
out-of-plane spin densities, which serves as an emerging mechanism for
efficient electrical control of magnetization in low-power, ultracompact
storage devices.

Abstract: Cavity polaritons, the elementary excitations appearing in quantum
microcavities in the strong-coupling regime, reveal clear signatures of quantum
collective behavior. The combination of unique spin structure and strong
nonlinear response opens the possibility of direct experimental observation of
a plethora of nontrivial optical polarization phenomena. Spin relaxation
processes are of crucial importance here. However, a mathematical formalism for
their coherent description is still absent. In the present paper, based on the
quantum hydrodynamics approach for a two-component liquid, we derive the set of
the corresponding equations where both energy and spin relaxation terms appear
naturally. We analyze in detail how these terms affect the dynamics of spinor
polariton droplets in the external magnetic field and the dispersion of
elementary excitations of a uniform polariton condensate. Although we focus on
the case of cavity polaritons, our approach can be applied to other cases of
spinor bosonic condensates, where the processes of spin relaxation play a major
role.

Abstract: The generation of indistinguishable single photons is a fundamental
requirement for future quantum technologies, particularly in quantum repeater
networks and for distributed quantum computing based on entanglement
distribution. However, spectral jitter, often induced by charge noise in
epitaxial quantum dots, leads to exciton dephasing, thereby limiting their
practical usage in quantum applications. We present a straightforward approach
to mitigate charge noise-induced decoherence in droplet-etched GaAs quantum
dots embedded in an n-i-p diode structure and integrated deterministically into
an electrically contacted circular Bragg grating resonator for emission
enhancement. The quantum device allows for the stabilization of the charge
environment by applying an external electrical field while producing a photon
extraction efficiency of approximately (37 +- 2)%. Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon
interference measurements reveal a strong voltage dependence of the exciton
dephasing time and interference visibility on the applied bias in excellent
agreement with our theoretical predictions. Notably, the reduction in
visibility from a maximum, charge-stabilized corrected value of 97 percent at
the optimum bias point follows an inverse square dependence (proportional to
1/I^2) with increasing diode current (I) in forward direction. Under a
quasi-resonant excitation scheme, we achieve a maximum exciton dephasing time
(T2*) of approximately (6.8 +-0.5) ns, reaching nearly the Fourier limit (T2 =
2T1) without the need for complex echo schemes like Ramsey or
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences. These findings are consistent with
theoretical predictions from rate equation modeling and quantum optical
analysis as well as voltage-dependent linewidth measurements, demonstrating
optimized electrical control of exciton dephasing.

Abstract: Heat transfer mediated by the Coulomb interaction reveals unconventional
thermodynamic behavior and broadens thermodynamics research into fields such as
quantum dynamics and information engineering. Although some experimental
demonstrations of phenomena utilizing Coulomb-mediated heat transfer have been
reported, estimations of their performance, such as efficiency, and their
theoretical evaluations necessitate qualitative evaluation of the transfer
mechanism itself, which remains challenging. We present an experiment
investigating single-electron dynamics in two electrostatically coupled silicon
nanodots to quantify Coulomb-mediated heat transfer at the nanoscale. By
estimating the Coulomb interaction strength between the dots using the
cross-correlation measurements of the single-electron dynamics, we convert the
single-electron dynamics into the statistics of Coulomb-mediated heat transfer.
Conducting the experiment at equilibrium enabled us to obtain a fluctuating
net-zero heat transfer between the dots. These heat transfer statistics are
essential for exploring device functionalities from the perspective of
stochastic thermodynamics and for verifying universal relations in
nonequilibrium states.

Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are crucial components in high-performance
spintronic devices. Traditional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials but
significant improvements in speed and packing density could be enabled by
exploiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds instead. Here, we report
all-collinear AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) fabricated with van der Waals
A-type AFM metal (Fe0.6Co0.4)5GeTe2 (FCGT) electrodes and nonmagnetic
semiconducting WSe2 tunnel barriers. The AFMTJ heterostructure device achieves
a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of up to 75% in response to magnetic
field switching. Our results demonstrate that the TMR exclusively emerges in
the AFM state of FCGT, rather than during the AFM-to-FM transition. By
engineering FCGT electrodes with either even- or odd-layer configurations,
volatile or non-volatile TMR could be selected, consistent with an entirely
interfacial effect. TMR in the even-layer devices arose by N\'eel vector
switching. In the odd-layer devices, TMR stemmed from interfacial
spin-flipping. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a new TMR mechanism
associated with interface-driven spin-polarized transport, despite the
spin-independent nature of bulk FCGT. Our work demonstrates that all-collinear
AFMTJs can provide comparable performance to conventional MTJs and introduces a
new paradigm for AFM spintronics, in which the spin-dependent properties of AFM
interfaces are harnessed.

Abstract: We propose and simulate a near-adiabatically coupling probing scheme for
nontrivial fusion of a pair of Majorara zero modes (MZMs). The scheme can avoid
the complexity of oscillating charge occupation in the probing quantum dot,
making thus practical measurements more feasible. We also show how to extract
the information of nonadiabatic transition and fermion parity violation caused
during moving the MZMs together to fuse, from the initial states prepared with
definite fermion parity. All the simulations, including the effective coupling
between the fusing MZMs, and their coupling to the probing quantum dot, are
based on the lattice model of a Rashba quantum wire in proximity contact with
an s-wave superconductor, under the modulation of mini-gate voltage control.

Abstract: The Euler class is a $\mathbb{Z}$-valued topological invariant that
characterizes a pair of real bands in a two-dimensional Brillouin zone. One of
the symmetries that permits its definition is $C_{2z}T$, where $C_{2z}$ denotes
a twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and $T$ denotes time-reversal symmetry.
Here, we study three-dimensional spinless insulators characterized by the Euler
class, focusing on the case where additional $C_{4z}$ or $C_{6z}$ rotational
symmetry is present, and investigate the relationship between the Euler class
of the occupied bands and their rotation eigenvalues. We first consider
two-dimensional systems and clarify the transformation rules for the real Berry
connection and curvature under point group operations, using the corresponding
sewing matrices. Applying these rules to $C_{4z}$ and $C_{6z}$ operations, we
obtain explicit formulas that relate the Euler class to the rotation
eigenvalues at high-symmetry points. We then extend our analysis to
three-dimensional systems, focusing on the difference in the Euler class
between the two $C_{2z}T$-invariant planes. We derive analytic expressions that
relate the difference in the Euler class to two types of
representation-protected invariants and analyze their phase transitions. We
further construct tight-binding models and perform numerical calculations to
support our analysis and elucidate the bulk-boundary correspondence.

Phenomenological models quantify coupling coefficients, while microscopic
approaches reveal spin-lattice in-teractions, including frustrated spin states

plasmonic skyrmion lattices and metasurfaces, en-hance ME effects for tunable

spin entanglement and topological protection in chiral chains and skyrmion
lattices for efficient energy conversion. Applications include high-sensitivity
magnetic sensors, tunable radio-frequency devices, energy-efficient MERAM,

Abstract: We theoretically investigate harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots
under linearly polarized optical pulses, focusing on excitonic effects.
Combining the tight-binding model and the single-particle density matrix
approach, we derive a semiconductor Bloch equation under a static-screened
Hartree-Fock approximation. This framework characterizes the electron-electron
interaction through local Hartree potentials for direct Coulomb interaction and
nonlocal Fock potentials for exchange interaction. Distinct confgurations of
Hartree and Fock terms yield various approximation methods, including
independent-particle approximation, mean-feld approximation, random phase
approximation, and excitonic effects. We thoroughly analyze how these
approximation methods affect the electronic energy levels, linear optical
absorption, and nonlinear harmonic generation. Within excitonic effects, we
present the dependence of harmonic generation on the geometric variations of
graphene quantum dots (sizes, triangular/hexagonal shapes, and armchair/zigzag
edges) and the amplitude and polarization of electric fields. Our findings show
that excitonic effects significantly enhance optical responses of graphene
nanostructures. For a dot ensemble formed by randomly oriented graphene quantum
dots,
  only odd-order harmonics exist along the polarization direction of the
incident light. Crucially, harmonic generation in graphene quantum dots
exhibits high tunability via geometric configuration, making them promising
candidates for nonlinear optical nanodevices.

Abstract: We report planar tunneling spectroscopy measurements on metal-WSe$_2$-twisted
bilayer graphene heterostructures across a broad range of gate and bias
voltages. The observed experimental features are attributed to phonon-assisted
tunneling and the significantly high density of states within the moir\'e
bands. A notable finding is the enhanced phonon-assisted tunneling in twisted
bilayer graphene compared to Bernal bilayer graphene, which arises from a more
relaxed in-plane momentum matching criterion. Theoretical calculations of
phonon dispersions enable us to identify low-energy phonon modes in both Bernal
and twisted bilayers of graphene, thereby elucidating the underlying mechanism
of tunneling. Our results establish planar tunneling as a versatile tool to
further understand electron-phonon coupling in twisted van der Waals materials.

Abstract: Heat transfer is a critical aspect of modern electronics, and a deeper
understanding of the underlying physics is essential for building faster,
smaller, and more powerful devices with an improved performance and efficiency.
In such nanoscale structures the heat transfer between two materials is limited
by the finite thermal boundary conductance across their interface. Using
ultrafast electron diffraction under grazing incidence we investigated the heat
transfer from ultrathin epitaxial Pb films to an Si(111) substrate under strong
non-equilibrium conditions. Applying an intense femtosecond laser pulse, the
5-7 ML thin Pb film experiences a strong heat up by 10-120 K while the Si
substrate remains cold at $\approx$ 10 K. At such large temperature
discontinuities we observe a significantly faster cooling for stronger excited
Pb films. The decrease of the corresponding cooling time constant is explained
through the thermal boundary conductance in the framework of the diffuse
mismatch model. The thermal boundary conductance is reduced by more than a
factor of three in comparison with Pb films grown on H-terminated substrates,
pointing out the importance of the morphology of substrate, film and their
interface.

Abstract: The quest for efficient and scalable thermoelectric materials has catalyzed
intense interest in quasi 1D nanoribbons, where reduced dimensionality and
structural tunability can decouple key transport parameters to enhance energy
conversion. In this work, we present a unified comparative study of the
thermopower in armchair nanoribbons derived from five archetypal 2D materials:
graphene, silicene, germanene, stanene and phosphorene. Using a tight binding
model parametrized by first principles inputs and solved within the Landauer
Buttiker formalism, we compute strain and width dependent thermopower across
nanoribbons classified by width families (3p, 3p+1, 3p+2) over a wide range of
uniaxial tensile strain. Our results reveal that thermoelectric behavior is
governed by a complex interplay of bandgap evolution, chemical potential
asymmetry, and quantum confinement. While graphene and silicene exhibit
pronounced family and width sensitive thermopower enhancement under moderate
strain, heavier Xenes such as germanene and stanene show diminished responses.
In particular, phosphorene nanoribbons emerge as exceptional, exhibiting
remarkably high thermopower (62 kB/e), a consequence of their large, persistent
bandgap and anisotropic electronic structure. Across all systems, the 3p+2
family transitions from near-metallic to semiconducting under strain, enabling
dramatic activation of thermopower in previously inactive configurations. This
systematic cross material analysis delineates the design principles for the
optimization of TE in 1D nanoribbons, highlighting the strategic use of width
control and strain engineering. Our findings identify phosphorene as an
intrinsically superior thermoelectric material and position strained Xene
nanoribbons as promising candidates for tunable, low-dimensional thermoelectric
devices.

For collection faster than carrier-phonon relaxation, we predict four-terminal
cells with higher power output than optimal two-terminal cells -- more than 40%
higher for fast carrier collection. Similar effects will occur in
