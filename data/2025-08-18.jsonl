We\nconstruct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose\ngenerators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible\nrepresentations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is\nnon-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per\nirrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order\nparameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have\ndistinct entanglement patterns.

Qualitatively, it is well understood\nthat the temperature-induced lattice and spin disorder determines the\ntemperature dependence of the resistivity. While prior publications reached\ngood agreement with experiment in the so-called supercell or direct approach\nfor non-magnetic materials where the spin-disorder contribution to the\nresistivity is negligible, an accurate, purely theoretical description of\nmagnetic materials remains elusive. This shortcoming can be attributed to the\nmissing accuracy in the description of the temperature-dependent spin-disorder\nitself. In this work, we employ a joint approach from \\textit{ab-initio}\ntransport calculations and atomistic modeling of the temperature-dependent\nspin-disorder. Using the example of $\\alpha$-Fe, we demonstrate that the\ninclusion of quantum mechanical effects using a semiclassical local\nquantization of the Heisenberg model significantly improves the description of\nthe spin-disorder component to the electrical resistivity. Compared to previous\napproaches, this model includes the description of magnetic short-range order\neffects, enabling us to study temperature effects around and above the Curie\ntemperature, where prior mean-field theory-based approaches inevitably\npredicted a constant contribution."}
