These oscillations are essential for\nsustaining vital processes, like neuronal firing, circadian rhythms, and\nheartbeats. In such systems, thermodynamic dissipation is necessary to maintain\noscillations against noise. However, due to their nonlinear dynamics, it has\nbeen challenging to determine how the characteristics of oscillations, such as\nfrequency, amplitude, and coherent patterns across elements, influence\ndissipation. To resolve this issue, we employ Koopman mode decomposition, which\nrecasts nonlinear dynamics as a linear evolution in a function space. This\nlinearization allows the dynamics to be decomposed into temporal oscillatory\nmodes coherent across elements, with the Koopman eigenvalues determining their\nfrequencies. Using this method, we decompose thermodynamic dissipation caused\nby nonconservative forces into contributions from oscillatory modes in\noverdamped nonlinear Langevin dynamics. We show that the dissipation from each\nmode is proportional to its frequency squared and its intensity, providing an\ninterpretable, mode-by-mode picture. In the noisy FitzHugh--Nagumo model, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in quantifying the impact of\noscillatory modes on dissipation during nonlinear phenomena like stochastic\nresonance and bifurcation. For instance, our analysis of stochastic resonance\nreveals that the greatest dissipation at the optimal noise intensity is\nsupported by a broad spectrum of frequencies, whereas at non-optimal noise\nlevels, dissipation is dominated by specific frequency modes. Our work offers a\ngeneral approach to connecting oscillations to dissipation in noisy\nenvironments and improves our understanding of diverse oscillation phenomena\nfrom a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective."}

Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) provides a\nprincipled framework for such tasks, yet prior studies often rely on simplified\nassumptions or omit real operational constraints.\n  This work proposes a hybrid QUBO framework integrating three advances: (i) a\nquantum-derived similarity kernel, obtained from a variational RX embedding, to\ndiscourage redundant SKU selections; (ii) exact per-period capacity enforcement\nvia slack-bit encoding to maintain feasibility; and (iii) execution on a\ntime-multiplexed Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) benchmarked against simulated\nquantum annealing (SQA) and classical optimization algorithms. The resulting\nmodel, with over one million quadratic terms and about 4,100 variables,\ncaptures profit, risk, and capacity interactions within a unified formulation.\n  On a dataset of 500 SKUs across eight planning periods, Quanfluence's CIM\nachieved an energy of minus 2.95 times 10 to the power of 16, producing robust\nsolutions with 288 distinct SKUs (approximately 60 percent of the catalog),\n226,813 allocated units, and 12.75 million dollars profit, all with zero\ncapacity violations. These results demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical\nQUBO methods can deliver feasible and profitable supply-chain allocations at an\nindustrial scale."}

In particular, parity and time\n(\\PT) symmetric Hamiltonians have generated interest due to the emergence of\nexceptional-point degeneracies, where both eigenenergies and eigenvectors\ncoalesce as the energy spectrum transitions from real- to complex-valued.\nBecause of the abrupt spectral response near exceptional points, such systems\nhave been proposed as candidates for precision quantum sensing. In this work,\nwe emulate a passive \\PT~dimer using a two-mode, non-Hermitian system of\nsuperconducting qubits comprising one high-coherence qubit coupled to an\nintentionally lossy qubit via a tunable coupler. The loss is introduced by\nstrongly coupling the qubit to a continuum of photonic modes in an open\nwaveguide environment. Using both pulsed and continuous-wave measurements, we\ncharacterize the system dynamics near the exceptional point. We observe a\nbehavior broadly consistent with an ideal passive \\PT~dimer with some\ncorrections due to the tunable coupler element. We extract the complex\neigenenergies associated with the two modes and calculate the sensitivity as a\nfunction of the coupling strength. Confirming theoretical predictions, we\nobserve no sensitivity enhancement near the quantum exceptional point. This\nstudy elucidates the limitations of exceptional-point systems as candidates for\nquantum-enhanced sensing."}

This inspiring fact suggests quantum batteries\nas plausible sources of power for future quantum devices, at least in\nprinciple. However, thermodynamically not all of the energy stored in a quantum\nbattery is useful for doing work. By considering a class of models based upon\nquantum continuous variables, here we show how the maximum extractable energy\nfrom a bosonic quantum battery can be intimately related to Heisenberg's\nuncertainty principle. We found that realizing minimum uncertainty essentially\nguarantees that all of the energy stored in a Gaussian quantum battery can be\nwithdrawn and used to do work. For a standard system where the charger and\nbattery are coupled linearly, this criterion is satisfied rather trivially.\nHowever, our theoretical results demonstrate that - for a quantum battery with\nnonlinear coupling - a state of minimum uncertainty can also be achieved\nnontrivially via the generation of quantum squeezing.
