One of the main approaches to achieve efficient state\npreparation is through the use of Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM), a\ntheoretical device for coherent data access with several proposed physical\nimplementations. In this work, we present a framework that integrates the\nphysical model of the Bucket Brigade QRAM (BBQRAM) with the classical data\nstructure of the Segment Tree to achieve efficient state preparation. We\nintroduce a memory layout that embeds a segment tree within BBQRAM memory cells\nby preserving the segment tree's hierarchy and supporting data retrieval in\nlogarithmic time via specialized access primitives. We demonstrate that, under\nthe proposed memory layout, our method encodes a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M\n\\times N}$ in a quantum register of $\\Theta(\\log_2(MN))$ qubits in\n$O(\\log_2^2(MN))$ time using constant ancillary qubits under a fixed-precision\nassumption. We further illustrate the method through a numerical example. This\nframework provides theoretical support for quantum algorithms that assume\nnegligible data loading overhead and establishes a foundation for designing\nclassical-to-quantum encoding algorithms that are aware of the underlying\nphysical QRAM architecture."}

Taking a step further, this work discovers a new\nclass of topological states of matter dubbed \\textit{quantum spin-tensor Hall}\n(QSTH) insulators with broken TRS, and their nontrivial topology is protected\nby a unique \\textit{pseudo-TRS}. Most strikingly, QSTH insulators exhibit a\nquantized rank-2 spin-tensor Hall conductivity, whereas both charge (rank-0)\nand spin (rank-1) conductivities vanish. We also fully characterize their\ntopological properties and highlight the physical interpretations via the\nunderlying connections to QSHE. Our work enriches the family of the famous Hall\neffects and sheds light on the intriguing topological state of matter in\nlarger-spin systems. It further offers new avenues toward spin-tensor-tronics\nand low-power atomtronics."}
