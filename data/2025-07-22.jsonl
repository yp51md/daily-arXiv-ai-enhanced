At its core, this\nchallenge is pinpointed by the question of how quantum effects can persist at\nasymptotic scales, analogous to quantum critical points in equilibrium. In this\nwork, we construct such a scenario using fermions as building blocks. These\nfermions undergo an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two\ntopologically distinct and quantum-correlated dark states. Starting from a\nmicroscopic, interacting Lindbladian, we derive an effective Lindblad-Keldysh\nfield theory in which critical fermions couple to a bosonic bath with\nhydrodynamic fluctuations associated with particle number conservation. A key\nfeature of this field theory is an emergent symmetry that protects the purity\nof the fermions' state even in the presence of the thermal bath. We\nquantitatively characterise the critical point using a leading-order expansion\naround the upper critical dimension, thereby establishing the first\nnon-equilibrium universality class of fermions. The symmetry protection\nmechanism, which exhibits parallels to the problem of directed percolation,\nsuggests a pathway toward a broader class of robust, universal quantum\nphenomena in fermionic systems."}

Here we study this optimization\nproblem in one dimension when resetting occurs to random positions, chosen from\na distribution with compact support that does not include the target. Depending\non the shape of this distribution, the optimal resetting rate either varies\nsmoothly with the mean distance to the target, as in single-site resetting, or\nexhibits a discontinuity caused by the presence of a second local minimum in\nthe mean first passage time. These two regimes are separated by a critical line\ncontaining a singular point that we characterize through a Ginzburg-Landau\ntheory.

In this study, we uncover the origin of the\nGranovskii-Zhedanov (GZ) scar within the framework of the modern understanding\nof quantum many-body scars. We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be\neffectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA)\nframework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian. This\ndescription, however, is applicable only in the XXZ limit, where a quasi-$U(1)$\nsymmetry exists within the scar subspace.

We propose two alternative techniques:\napproximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar\nsubspace in the XYZ case. Using these approaches, we can characterize the scar\nsubspaces. We further explore the possibility of constructing\nlattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange\nsystems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar\nconstruction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be\nsupported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with\nan odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination\nnumbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in\nspecific scenarios.

Early examples of\nquantum computational sensing (QCS) have largely focused on protocols where\nonly a single sensing operation appears before measurement -- with an exception\nbeing the recent application of Grover's algorithm to signal detection. In this\npaper we present, in theory and numerical simulations, the application of two\nquantum algorithms -- quantum signal processing and quantum neural networks --\nto various binary and multiclass machine-learning classification tasks in\nsensing. Here sensing operations are interleaved with computing operations,\ngiving rise to nonlinear functions of the sensed signals. We have evaluated\ntasks based on static and time-varying signals, including spatiotemporal\nsignals. Our approach to optimizing the circuit parameters in a QCS protocol\ntakes into account quantum sampling noise and allows us to engineer protocols\nthat can yield accurate results with as few as just a single measurement shot.\nIn all cases, we have been able to show a regime of operation where a quantum\ncomputational sensor can achieve higher accuracy than a conventional quantum\nsensor, with a simulated accuracy advantage of $>$20 percentage points for some\ntasks. We also present protocols for performing nonlinear tasks using\nHamiltonian-engineered bosonic systems and quantum signal processing with\nhybrid qubit-bosonic systems. Overall, we have shown that substantial quantum\ncomputational-sensing advantages can be obtained even if the quantum system is\nsmall, including few-qubit systems, systems comprising a single qubit and a\nsingle bosonic mode, and even just a single qubit alone -- raising the\nprospects for experimental proof-of-principle and practical realizations."}

The proper way to understand tensor networks\nthemselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they\ndescribe exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for\ngapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected\nentangled paired state, emerged as an elegant analytical framework from\nnumerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However,\nfor gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement\nrenormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so\nfar been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA\nintrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for\nMERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent\nnetworks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously\nconstructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains,\nwhich can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA.

This type of non-Hermitian response can be\nengineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and\nis rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature\ndipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular\ncircular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative\nmedium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and\ngain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred\ndirection parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding\nelectromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force\ncan be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall\ncurrent. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the\nresulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional\ncurrent-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation\ncharacteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking.
