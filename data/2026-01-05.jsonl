The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices."}

The model incorporates magnetic free-energy contributions arising from the coupling between the applied field and the magnetic susceptibility of the nucleating material, yielding a closed-form relation between nanoparticle radius and field strength. Our approach reproduces the experimentally observed decrease in the most-probable particle radius from approximately 170 nm at 49.27 mT when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the stirring plane, and to 155 nm at 180.78 mT in the perpendicular configuration. Across the investigated field range, the theoretical predictions remain consistent with experimental measurements obtained under continuous mechanical stirring, supporting the interpretation that the observed size reduction originates from a magnetic-field-induced modification of the nucleation free-energy landscape. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the results provide a physically transparent and computationally efficient framework for understanding magnetic-field-controlled nanoparticle size selection."}

Palladium hydride ($\\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $α$-$\\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $β$-$\\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $α/β$-$\\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected by the confined geometry of a nanocrystal. However, how nanocrystal geometry influences phase transformation pathways is largely unknown. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize hydrogenation in Pd nanocrystals with two geometries -- a nanocube and a hexagonal nanoplate. Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $α/β$-$\\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\\{100\\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\\{110\\}$- and $\\{211\\}$-aligned interfaces.

This gives rise to a series of exceptional points of two types, the intra-band and the inter-band. Leveraging the topology of the spectral Riemann surface close to these exceptional points, we demonstrate the path-dependent chiral transfer of atoms to the higher-lying bands, by evolving the system along closed loops in the parameter space. Specifically, we illustrate two distinct scenarios, characterized by different mechanisms, where the atoms can be transferred to designated SOAMC-dressed bands. Our work demonstrates the rich exceptional structure in atom gases under dissipative SOAMC, and offers a novel route toward populating higher bands."}

Our findings establish an unusual magnetic ground state in the Mott insulating Ca2ScRuO6, where a long range ordered antiferromagnet coexists with small magnetic clusters, which manifests a ferrimagnetic-like high temperature inverse magnetic susceptibility.

To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs. We also observe distinct critical behaviour in average and typical correlation functions, reflecting the different scaling properties of generalised inverse participation ratios."}

Deriving observables aligned with the prediction of the canonical ensemble for a quantum system relies on the presence of a bath provided either as an external environment or as a larger part of a closed system. We demonstrate that thermal (canonical) observables for a whole closed quantum system of finite size can arise in the absence of a bath. These thermal observables stem from classical averaging over randomized unitary evolutions for a few-body system. The temperature in the canonical ensemble appears as a global constraint on the total energy of the system, determined by the choice of the initial state. From averaging randomized evolutions, we derive spin-spin correlation functions for a finite spin chain and show that they exhibit a temperature-dependent finite correlation length, in agreement with the prediction of the canonical ensemble. This establishes a method for computing thermal observables in a closed, finite-size system from real-time propagation without a bath. An implementation of this thermalization approach on a quantum computer can be utilized for thermal state preparation."}

However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)."}

Spherical neutron polarimetry and high-intensity single-crystal neutron diffraction reveal the first case of a longitudinal spin-density wave masking the ferromagnetic quantum critical point. The spin-density wave is characterised by a large-wavelength incommensurate modulation of its low average moment. It is formed from ferrimagnetic building blocks with antiparallel ferromagnetic sheets. The existence of ferromagnetic sheets and cancellation of the magnetisation only over mesoscopic length scales show local similarity between the spin-density wave and the ferromagnetic parent phase and indicate the spin-density wave's unconventional nature as emerging from underlying ferromagnetic quantum criticality."}

By tuning the magnon wavelength to match the size of these textures, specifically, atomic-scale skyrmions in centrosymmetric frustrated magnets, we achieve strong interference effects.

To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems.

The central focus is the detection loophole, a challenge in which imperfect detectors can allow classical hidden variable models to mimic quantum correlations, thus masking genuine non-classicality. As a review, the article revisits the paradigmatic Bell scenario, detailing the efficiency requirements for the CHSH inequality, such as the 2/3 threshold for symmetric efficiencies, and traces the historical trajectory toward the first loophole-free tests. The analysis extends to other causal structures to explore how efficiency requirements are affected in different contexts. These include the instrumental scenario, which for binary variables has recently been shown to follow the same inefficiency bounds as the bipartite dichotomic Bell scenario; the prepare-and-measure scenario, where inefficiencies impact the certification of a quantum system's dimension and create security breaches in protocols such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD); and the bilocality scenario, which exemplifies how employing multiple independent sources can significantly relax the required efficiencies to certify non-classical correlations."}

In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, systems are a special class of non-Hermitian ones. They describe open systems but may still have real energy spectrum. The eigenmodes are however not orthogonal in general. This qualitative difference to Hermitian physics has a range of consequences for the physical behaviour of the system in the steady state or when it is subjected to external perturbations. This overview reviews the recent progress in the field of pseudo-Hermitian physics as it unfolds when applied to low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. The focus is mainly on long wave length spin excitations (spin waves) with magnons being the energy quanta of these excitations. Various setups including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, magnonic crystals, and hybride structures with different types of coupling to the environments as well as spatio-temporally engineered systems will be discussed with a focus on the particular aspects that are brought about by the pseudo-Hermiticity such as mode amplifications, non-reciprocal propagation, magnon cloaking, non-Hermitian skin effect, PT-symmetric assisted Floquet engineering, topological energy transfer, and field-induced enhanced sensitivity."}

However, it is widely believed that topological properties are destroyed when the bulk energy gap closes, making it highly nontrivial to consider topology in gapless quantum critical systems. To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems. Additionally, we discuss further generalizations and future directions, including higher dimensions, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and realizations in modern experiments."}

By tuning the magnon wavelength to match the size of these textures, specifically, atomic-scale skyrmions in centrosymmetric frustrated magnets, we achieve strong interference effects. This leads to the emergence of magnon superlattices, shaped by the internal skyrmion structure and the underlying Mexican-hat magnon dispersion. Furthermore, helicity-driven nonlinear dynamics give rise to dispersive magnon bands with nontrivial Chern numbers within the first magnon gap.

To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs. We also observe distinct critical behaviour in average and typical correlation functions, reflecting the different scaling properties of generalised inverse participation ratios."}

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a natural candidate, but the electronic zero-field splitting exhibits a large fractional temperature dependence, which has precluded its use as a stable clock transition. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by forming a composite frequency reference that combines measurements of the electronic splitting D with the nuclear quadrupole splitting of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin intrinsic to the NV center. We further benchmark this composite approach against alternative strategies for mitigating temperature sensitivity. By implementing a specially designed pulse sequence with an eight-phase control scheme that suppresses pulse imperfections, we interleave measurements of D and Q in a high-density NV ensemble and demonstrate a temperature-compensated composite frequency reference. The stability of this composite diamond clock is characterized over a 10-day period at room temperature through a comparison to a Rb vapor-cell clock, yielding a fractional instability below $5 \\times 10^{-9}$ for an averaging time of $τ= 200$ s and below $1 \\times 10^{-8}$ at $τ= 2 \\times 10^5$ s, corresponding to measured improvements by a factor of 4 and 200, respectively, over a clock based purely on the single frequency D for the same periods.

These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems."}

While significant progress has been made in DQC for quantum circuit models, there exists much less research on DQC for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), which is a universal quantum computing model that is essentially different from the circuit model and particularly well-suited to photonic quantum platforms. In this paper, we propose DC-MBQC, the first distributed quantum compilation framework tailored for MBQC. We identify and address two key challenges in enabling DQC for MBQC. First, for task allocation among quantum processing units (QPUs), we develop an adaptive graph partitioning algorithm that preserves the structure of the graph state while balancing the workload across QPUs. Second, for inter-QPU communication, we introduce the layer scheduling problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Regrading realistic hardware requirements, we optimize the execution time of running quantum programs and the corresponding required photon lifetime to avoid fatal failures caused by photon loss. Our experiments demonstrate a $7.46\\times$ improvement on required photon lifetime and $6.82\\times$ speedup with 8 fully-connected QPUs, which further confirm the advantage of distributed quantum computing in photonic systems.

The method combines the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform with an exact partition of Pauli operators. It achieves an exponential speedup over direct approaches, reducing the average cost per sampled Pauli string from $O(2^N)$ to $O(N)$. Building on this framework, we further develop a Monte-Carlo estimator for stabilizer Rényi entropies together with a Clifford-based variance-reduction scheme that suppresses sampling fluctuations. We benchmark the accuracy and efficiency on ensembles of random magic states, and apply the method to random Clifford circuits with doped $T$ gates, comparing different doping architectures. Our approach applies to arbitrary quantum states and provides quantitative access to magic resources both encoded in highly entangled states and generated by long-time nonequilibrium dynamics."}

QEC reduces error rates by encoding logical information across redundant physical qubits, enabling errors to be detected and corrected. A common decoder used for this task is Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) a graph-based algorithm that relies on edge weights to identify the most likely error chains. In this work, we propose a data-driven decoder named Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (NMWPM). Our decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract local syndrome features and Transformers to capture long-range global dependencies, which are then used to predict dynamic edge weights for the MWPM decoder. To facilitate training through the non-differentiable MWPM algorithm, we formulate a novel proxy loss function that enables end-to-end optimization. Our findings demonstrate significant performance reduction in the Logical Error Rate (LER) over standard baselines, highlighting the advantage of hybrid decoders that combine the predictive capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic structure of classical matching."}

We address these challenges for solid state Hamiltonians by introducing a logarithmic-qubit encoding that maps a system with $N$ physical sites onto only $\\lceil \\log_2 N \\rceil$ qubits while maintaining a clear correspondence with the underlying physical model. Within this reduced register, we construct a compatible variational circuit and a Gray-code-inspired measurement strategy whose number of global settings grows only logarithmically with system size. To quantify the overall hardware load, we introduce a volumetric efficiency metric that combines the number of qubit, circuit depth, and the number of measurement settings into a single measure, expressing the overall computation costs. Using this metric, we show that the total space-time-sampling volume required in a variational loop can be reduced dramatically from $N^2$ to $(logN)^3$ for hardware efficient ansatz, allowing an exponential reduction in time and size of the quantum hardware. These results demonstrate that large, structured solid-state Hamiltonians can be simulated on substantially smaller quantum registers with controlled sampling overhead and manageable circuit complexity, extending the reach of variational quantum algorithms on near-term devices."}

We introduce the \\emph{first-time negativity} (FTN) of the Margenau-Hill quasiprobability as a dynamical indicator of when local measurement sequences in an interacting quantum system begin to exhibit genuinely nonclassical behavior. Using the Ising chain, we show that FTN discriminates clearly between interaction-dominated and field-dominated regimes, is systematically reshaped by temperature, and responds sensitively to the breaking of integrability. When measurements are performed on different sites, FTN reveals a characteristic spatio-temporal structure that reflects the finite-time spreading of operator incompatibility across the lattice. We further compare the numerical onset of negativity with a recently proposed quantum speed limit (QSL) for quasiprobabilities, which provides a geometric benchmark for the observed dynamics. Our results identify FTN as a practical and experimentally accessible probe of real-time quantum coherence and contextuality, directly suited to current platforms capable of sequential weak and strong measurements."}

These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems."}

In the quantum setting, however, privacy is defined operationally against arbitrary measurements, and classical composition arguments based on scalar privacy-loss random variables no longer apply. As a result, it has remained unclear when meaningful composition guarantees can be obtained for quantum differential privacy (QDP).\n  In this work, we clarify both the limitations and possibilities of composition in the quantum setting. We first show that classical-style composition fails in full generality for POVM-based approximate QDP: even quantum channels that are individually perfectly private can completely lose privacy when combined through correlated joint implementations. We then identify a setting in which clean composition guarantees can be restored. For tensor-product channels acting on product neighboring inputs, we introduce a quantum moments accountant based on an operator-valued notion of privacy loss and a matrix moment-generating function. Although the resulting Rényi-type divergence does not satisfy a data-processing inequality, we prove that controlling its moments suffices to bound measured Rényi divergence, yielding operational privacy guarantees against arbitrary measurements. This leads to advanced-composition-style bounds with the same leading-order behavior as in the classical theory.\n  Our results demonstrate that meaningful composition theorems for quantum differential privacy require carefully articulated structural assumptions on channels, inputs, and adversarial measurements, and provide a principled framework for understanding which classical ideas do and do not extend to the quantum setting."}

While recent progress has clarified limitations of probabilistic transformations in general resource theories, an analytic formula for the error exponent of probabilistic entanglement distillation under approximately (dually) nonentangling operations has remained unavailable.\n  Building on the framework of postselected quantum hypothesis testing, we establish a direct connection between probabilistic distillation and postselected hypothesis testing against the set of separable states. In particular, we derive an analytical characterization of the distillation error exponent under ANE.

For a quantum designer, such a conventional technique requires extensive computational time and effort, which may generate an n-bit quantum gate with a too high quantum cost. The Bloch sphere is only utilized as a visualization tool to verify the conventional design correctness for quantum rotations by a quantum gate. In contrast, this paper introduces a new concept of using the Bloch sphere as a \"geometrical design tool\" to build cost-effective n-bit quantum gates with lower quantum costs. This concept is termed the \"Bloch sphere approach (BSA)\". In BSA, a cost-effective n-bit quantum gate is built without using any unitary matrices multiplication. Instead, the quantum rotations for such a gate are visually selected using the geometrical planar intersections of the Bloch sphere. The BSA can efficiently map m targets among n-m controls for an n-bit quantum gate, to satisfy the limited layout connectivity for the physical neighboring qubits of a quantum computer. Experimentally, n-bit quantum gates built using the BSA always have lower quantum costs than those for such gates built using the conventional quantum design techniques."}

Standard geometries of one-dimensional atomic chains coupled to waveguides allow only a single bright superradiant channel, while subradiant modes remain weakly accessible, limiting control over collective radiative behavior and dark-state pathways. This leads to unwanted inelastic processes, degrading memory fidelity and reducing nonlinear photon generation efficiency. Here, we propose two two-dimensional (2D) atomic lattice geometries coupled to a photonic crystal waveguide, namely Zigzag and Orthogonal structures. In the Zigzag model, engineered collective super- and subradiant modes produce a flattened EIT window, broadening the transmission bandwidth and suppressing unwanted scattering to enhance quantum memory fidelity. In the Orthogonal model, four-wave mixing (FWM) intensity is amplified by up to six orders of magnitude relative to a conventional one-dimensional $Λ$-type EIT chain with identical $Γ_{1D}$, $Ω_c$, and probe intensity, with localized idler photons forming well-defined spectral modes.

In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of Förster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \\re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \\re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \\re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor. This indicates that the actual detection of such effects through conventional RET efficiency measurement requires either high precision or utilization of a donor with fast spontaneous decay rate of excitation."}

For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as accessible and which transformations are regarded as gauge. We introduce and analyze a geometric complexity functional for families of quantum channels based on unitary dilations. We distinguish an implementation-dependent complexity, defined relative to explicit dilation data, from an intrinsic channel complexity obtained by minimizing over a physically motivated class of admissible dilations (e.g. bounded environment dimension, energy or norm constraints, and penalty structures). The functional has a subtractive form: it compares the geometric cost of the total unitary realization with a canonical surrogate term that removes purely environmental contributions. We justify this subtraction from concise postulates, including closed-system consistency, environment-only neutrality, and invariance under dilation gauge transformations that leave the channel unchanged. This leads to a companion quantity, noise complexity, quantifying the loss of geometric complexity relative to a prescribed ideal closed evolution. We establish a coherence-based lower bound for unitary geometric complexity, derive structural properties such as linear time scaling under time-homogeneous dilations, and obtain dissipator--controlled bounds in the Markovian (GKSL/Lindblad) regime under a standard dilation construction. Finally, we illustrate the framework on canonical benchmark noise models, including dephasing, amplitude damping, and depolarizing (Pauli) channels."}

Generalizing the heuristic of minimum accuracy from classification to regression, we evaluate axis-aligned predictors within the Pauli feature space. We formally prove that the optimal axis-aligned predictor constitutes a rigorous upper bound on the minimum training Mean Squared Error (MSE) attainable by any linear or kernel-based regressor defined on the same quantum feature map. Since computing this exact bound requires an intractable scan of the full Pauli basis, we introduce a Monte Carlo framework to efficiently estimate it using a tractable subset of measurement axes. We further provide non-asymptotic statistical guarantees to certify performance within a practical measurement budget. This method enables rapid comparison of quantum feature maps and early diagnosis of expressivity, allowing for the informed selection of architectures before deploying higher-complexity models."}

We introduce an efficient classical algorithm that exactly computes stabilizer Rényi entropies and stabilizer nullity for generic many-body wavefunctions of $N$ qubits. The method combines the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform with an exact partition of Pauli operators. It achieves an exponential speedup over direct approaches, reducing the average cost per sampled Pauli string from $O(2^N)$ to $O(N)$. Building on this framework, we further develop a Monte-Carlo estimator for stabilizer Rényi entropies together with a Clifford-based variance-reduction scheme that suppresses sampling fluctuations. We benchmark the accuracy and efficiency on ensembles of random magic states, and apply the method to random Clifford circuits with doped $T$ gates, comparing different doping architectures. Our approach applies to arbitrary quantum states and provides quantitative access to magic resources both encoded in highly entangled states and generated by long-time nonequilibrium dynamics."}

Such a function p from S to [0,1] is known as a numerical event or more accurately an S-probability. A set P of numerical events including the constant functions 0 and 1 and 1-p with every p in P becomes a poset when ordered by the order of real functions and can serve as a general setting for quantum logics. We call such a poset P a general set of events (GSE). The thoroughly investigated algebras of S-probabilities (including Hilbert logics), concrete logics and Boolean algebras can all be represented within this setting. In this paper we study various classes of GSEs, in particular those that are orthoposets and their interrelations and connections to known logics. Moreover, we characterize GSEs as posets by means of states and discuss the situation for GSEs to be lattices."}

Gnezdilov", "Andrei I. Pavlov"], "title": "Thermalization in a closed quantum system from randomized dynamics", "comment": "8 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "The emergence of statistical mechanics from quantum dynamics is a central problem in quantum many-body physics. Deriving observables aligned with the prediction of the canonical ensemble for a quantum system relies on the presence of a bath provided either as an external environment or as a larger part of a closed system. We demonstrate that thermal (canonical) observables for a whole closed quantum system of finite size can arise in the absence of a bath. These thermal observables stem from classical averaging over randomized unitary evolutions for a few-body system. The temperature in the canonical ensemble appears as a global constraint on the total energy of the system, determined by the choice of the initial state. From averaging randomized evolutions, we derive spin-spin correlation functions for a finite spin chain and show that they exhibit a temperature-dependent finite correlation length, in agreement with the prediction of the canonical ensemble. This establishes a method for computing thermal observables in a closed, finite-size system from real-time propagation without a bath. An implementation of this thermalization approach on a quantum computer can be utilized for thermal state preparation."}

The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices."}

To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs. We also observe distinct critical behaviour in average and typical correlation functions, reflecting the different scaling properties of generalised inverse participation ratios."}

A model may however have different HSFs depending on the method for identifying them. Here we establish a connection between two vastly distinct methods recently proposed for identifying HSF: the commutant algebra (CA) method and integer characteristic polynomial factorization (ICPF) method. For a Hamiltonian consisting of operators admitting rational number matrix representations, we prove a theorem that, if its center of commutant algebra have all eigenvalues being rational, the HSF from the ICPF method must be equal to or finer than that from the CA method. We show that this condition is satisfied by most known models exhibiting HSF, for which we demonstrate the validity of our theorem. We further discuss representative models for which ICPF and CA methods yield different HSFs. Our results may facilitate the exploration of a unified definition of HSF."}

The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $Δ_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $Δ_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $Δ_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response. To our knowledge, this work provides the first self-consistent analysis of $Δ_T$ noise in superconducting hybrid junctions where e-h symmetry is broken, explicitly revealing how Andreev reflection modifies $Δ_T$ noise beyond the symmetry-protected zero-thermovoltage regime."}

In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, systems are a special class of non-Hermitian ones. They describe open systems but may still have real energy spectrum. The eigenmodes are however not orthogonal in general. This qualitative difference to Hermitian physics has a range of consequences for the physical behaviour of the system in the steady state or when it is subjected to external perturbations. This overview reviews the recent progress in the field of pseudo-Hermitian physics as it unfolds when applied to low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. The focus is mainly on long wave length spin excitations (spin waves) with magnons being the energy quanta of these excitations. Various setups including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, magnonic crystals, and hybride structures with different types of coupling to the environments as well as spatio-temporally engineered systems will be discussed with a focus on the particular aspects that are brought about by the pseudo-Hermiticity such as mode amplifications, non-reciprocal propagation, magnon cloaking, non-Hermitian skin effect, PT-symmetric assisted Floquet engineering, topological energy transfer, and field-induced enhanced sensitivity."}
