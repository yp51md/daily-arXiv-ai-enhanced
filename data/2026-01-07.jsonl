While ground states at integer fillings are typically identified as quantum Hall ferromagnets within a Hartree-Fock framework, we propose the existence of symmetric topological Mott insulators (STMIs) that transcend this Slater determinant picture. Focusing on half-filling of each flavor per unit cell, we demonstrate the existence of STMIs which exhibit a quantized charge or spin Hall response. We first establish this phase in a bilayer Haldane-Hubbard model with localized orbitals on the $A$ sublattice and dispersive band on the $B$ sublattice. Starting from a trivial Mott insulator on the $A$ sublattice, tuning the sublattice potential drives a Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) transition of the associated $p-\\mathrm{i}p$ exciton pairing, realizing a topological Mott insulator with $C=1$ per flavor. We further generalize this construction to a single-layer spinful model, where the resulting STMI hosts charge edge modes coexisting with bulk local moments. A Mott semimetal is identified at the quantum critical point between the STMI and the trivial Mott insulator. Finally, we discuss applications to AA-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$, proposing a ferromagnetic Chern insulator phase as a low-temperature descendant of the symmetric Mott semimetal."}

Building on a ``parity-graded'' representation [1], we prove that any continuous fermionic wavefunction on a compact domain can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a linear combination of K antisymmetric basis functions--such as pairwise products or Slater determinants--multiplied by symmetric functions. A key result is that the number of required bases is provably small: K=1 suffices in one-dimensional continua (and on lattices in any dimension), K=2 suffices in two dimensions, and in higher dimensions K grows at most linearly with particle number. The antisymmetric bases can be learned by small neural networks, while the symmetric factors are implemented by permutation-invariant networks whose width scales only linearly with particle number. Thus, Fermi Sets achieve universal approximation of fermionic wavefunctions with minimal overhead while retaining clear physical interpretability."}

Ho-based pyrochlores host a dipolar spin-ice ground state, characterized by Ising moments constrained by the ice rules and elementary excitations analogous to magnetic monopoles. Here we examine how controlled chemical disorder influences this state by introducing site mixing on the non-magnetic $B$-site in two compounds. Ho$_2$GaSbO$_7$ contains only Ga$^{3+}$/Sb$^{5+}$ charge disorder, whereas Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$ exhibits both charge and substantial size disorder arising from the large ionic-radius mismatch between Sc$^{3+}$ and Sb$^{5+}$. Although both materials retain the pyrochlore structure, neutron scattering measurements reveal a reduced correlation length for the $R/B$-site cation ordering and enhanced local structural distortions in Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$. Despite these structural differences, bulk thermodynamic measurements and magnetic diffuse scattering demonstrate that both systems exhibit the defining signatures of a dipolar spin-ice state. Low-energy inelastic neutron spectroscopy further uncovers broad magnetic excitations that develop within the dipolar spin-ice regime, a feature absent in pristine Ho pyrochlores and indicative of disorder-induced splitting of the non-Kramers ground-state doublet. Together, these results show that controlled disorder generates tunable transverse-field-driven quantum fluctuations in Ho-based pyrochlores, although the dipolar spin-ice state is remarkably robust to this disorder."}

Beyond the topology of individual degeneracies, their mutual interactions yield richer phenomena. A representative example is the anomalous non-annihilating collision of pairwise-created degeneracies, previously believed to occur only in non-Abelian multiband systems. Here, we theoretically reveal and experimentally demonstrate that such an anomalous collision can emerge even in a simple two-band system without non-Abelian nature. In a two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice whose Brillouin zone forms a nonorientable Klein bottle, two EPs with opposite topological charges, pairwise created from a hybrid point, merge into a new vortex point upon re-encounter, instead of annihilating. Remarkably, the hybrid point is a defective degeneracy featuring no eigenenergy braiding, whereas the vortex point is a non-defective degeneracy yet exhibits nontrivial eigenenergy braiding. This process manifests a non-Hermitian phase transition from a gapped phase to a gapless phase, a scenario that we directly observe in a hybrid-dimensional acoustic lattice via momentum-resolved band braid and Berry phase measurements. Our findings identify nonorientability as a new arena for engineering band degeneracies and topological phases, and pave the way for experimentally exploring the interplay between exceptional and nonorientable topology."}

Combining three representative boundary types enables topological waveguides with flexible designability and enhanced functionality. However, one of the three, namely the armchair boundary, has long been limited by inter-valley scattering, resulting in weak topological protection and severely restricting its use in practical devices. This long-standing constraint is a major barrier to realizing broadly applicable topological waveguide systems. Here, to address this challenge toward a broadly applicable design framework for topological waveguides, we experimentally demonstrate that topological adiabatic geometry implemented in a micro electromechanical system suppresses valley mixing. We found that the adiabaticity enhances immunity to defects and increases the transmission efficiency of the armchair boundary. As the adiabaticity increases, topological protection is recovered over an increasingly broad portion of the bulk band gap, extending from low to high frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the recovery of protection in the adiabatic armchair boundary enables waves to propagate through 90^° and 150^°-bent waveguides by coupling with other interface geometries. Suppressing valley mixing via adiabaticity paves the way for a universal design framework for topological waveguides and for restoring robust topological characteristics across a wide range of wave phenomena."}

This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter.

This interaction enables a nontrivial interplay between topology and nonlinear dynamics in soliton pumping. In the weakly interacting regime, the ground-state soliton undergoes quantized Thouless pumping. At intermediate interaction strengths, soliton creation and annihilation break adiabaticity and disrupt quantized transport. In the strong-coupling regime, the coexistence of ground- and excited-state solitons leads to negligible coupling at energy crossings, giving rise to discrete time-translation symmetry breaking (DTTSB) in the soliton dynamics. Comparison of mean-field results with exact diagonalization along closed circular pumping paths confirms both the validity of the mean-field description and the robustness of DTTSB across different pumping trajectories. Our findings reveal how interaction-induced effects can fundamentally modify topological transport and suggest that these phenomena may be explored in cold-atom, photonic, and superconducting-circuit platforms."}

Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm on a restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) lattice model demonstrate that intrinsic step jamming persists on surfaces below 20 nm. In the present model, transport processes such as surface and volume diffusion are excluded, as are elastic interactions, step-step repulsion or attraction, and stoichiometric effects. We show that intrinsic step jamming arises from asymmetric fluctuations in atomic attachment and detachment driven by biased transition probabilities under the SOS restriction, leading to collective step congestion. Asymmetric fluctuations also determine whether adatom or hole clusters grow or recede. This mechanism bears close similarity to jamming phenomena in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), including multi-lane variants. In contrast, symmetric thermal fluctuations generate adatom or hole clusters on terraces, thereby suppressing intrinsic step jamming. Possible routes to suppress intrinsic step jamming, including experimentally accessible strategies, are also discussed."}

We introduce the new concept of ``Multi-Valued Input Fixed Polarity Reed-Muller (MVI-RM)\" forms. Our decoder-based circuit uses three logical levels in contrast to commonly-used methods based on Exclusive-or Sum of Products (ESOP) with two levels (AND-XOR expressions), realized by Toffoli gates. In general, the high number of input qubits in the resulting Toffoli gates is a problem that greatly impacts the quantum cost. Using decoders decreases the number of input qubits in these Toffoli gates. We present two practical algorithms for three-level circuit synthesis by finding the MVI-FPRM: products-matching and the newly developed butterfly diagrams. The best MVI-FPRM forms are factorized and reduced to approximate Multi-Valued Input Generalized Reed-Muller (MVI-GRM) forms."}

In the context of spin systems, it represents the population of the sublevels of the magnetization in the $z$-direction. We use this quantity to probe the onset of thermalization in the isolated quantum and classical one-dimensional spin-1 Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields. Thermalization is achieved when the long-time average of the occupation number converges to the microcanonical prediction as the chain length $L$ increases, consistent with the emergence of ergodicity. However, the finite-size scaling analysis in the quantum model is challenged by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with $L$. To overcome this limitation, we turn to the corresponding classical model, which enables access to much larger system sizes. By tracking the dynamics of individual spins on their three-dimensional Bloch spheres and employing tools from random matrix theory, we establish a quantitative criterion for classical ergodicity in interacting spin systems. We find that deviations from classical ergodicity decay algebraically with system size. This power-law scaling then provides a quantitative bound on the approach to thermal equilibrium in the quantum model."}

Based on the Floquet Hamiltonian, we find the increasing of CPL driving intensity can cause the crossing of Floquet bands between the two valleys.

We show through numerical simulations that the new method resolves finer spectral features, while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional approaches to noise spectroscopy. Second, we simplify the experimental implementation of the method, by introducing Rademacher measurements for reconstructing sparse noise spectra. These measurements use pseudorandom pulse sequences that can be generated in real time from a short random seed, reducing experimental complexity without compromising reconstruction accuracy. Together, these developments broaden the reach of random pulse sequences for accurate and efficient noise characterization in realistic quantum systems."}

In this study, we employ the low-temperature bonding technique integral to hybrid bonding to fabricate SiO-SiO interfaces and investigate their thermal boundary conductance using time domain thermoreflectance. Structural characterizations show high quality bonded interfaces.

At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling."}

Since such rounds contribute, negatively, to the error correction leakage, this results in a correct, though sub-optimal bound. Here, we derive a new proof of security for CAD applied to the decoy state BB84 protocol, computing a bound on Eve's uncertainty in all possible single and vacuum photon events.

Typically, quantum-limited amplification is achieved with parametric down-conversion of a strong pump tone, which imposes significant hardware overhead and severely limits scalability. Here, we demonstrate the first DC-powered broadband amplifier operating within 0.2 photons of the quantum limit. Our impedance-engineered Inelastic Cooper-pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA)-a voltage-biased SQUID in which Cooper pairs tunnel inelastically by emitting signal-idler photon pairs-operates in reflection, delivering 13 dB of average gain across a 3.5 GHz bandwidth in a single stage. Semiclassical simulations accurately predict the gain and saturation power, enabling further design improvements. By eliminating the pump-tone infrastructure, the broadband ICTA promises to dramatically reduce the hardware complexity of quantum-limited amplification in superconducting quantum processors."}

Considering a binary mixture of active Brownian particles with two distinct self-propulsion strengths, we find that, the interplay between interaction range, self-propulsion strengths and the relative numbers of the particles with different propulsion strengths can lead to three different phases, namely, a disordered one, and two ordered ones with partial and complete spatial and orientational ordering. The partially ordered phase is characterized by formation of a ring-like assembly of the slower particles while the faster particles diffuse randomly. Two concentric rings, comprising faster and slower particles, form in the fully ordered phase. Using the example of a truncated harmonic potential, we analytically characterize the phase boundaries and identify the associated order parameters. Our results demonstrate that propulsion dispersion provides a robust and novel route to collective ordering in attractive active matter."}

This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT.

While previous studies have mainly concentrated on single-parameter estimation via quantum Cramér-Rao bound, the multi-parameter case remains significantly underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the multiparameter estimation for a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a vacuum scalar field in both bounded and unbounded Minkowski vacuum. Our analysis reveals that quantum Cramér-Rao bound fails to provide a tight error bound for the two-parameter estimation involving the initial phase and weight parameters. For this reason, we numerically compute two tighter error bounds, Holevo Cramér-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, based on a semidefinite program. Notably, our results demonstrate that Nagaoka bound yields the tightest error bound among all the considered error bounds, consistent with the general hierarchy of multiparameter quantum estimation. In the case with a boundary, we observe the introduction of boundary systematically reduces the values of both Holevo Cramér-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, indicating an improvement on the attainable estimation precision. These results offer valuable insights on and practical guidance for advancing multiparameter estimation in relativistic context."}

Here we take a transformation-based approach and experimentally examine transitions between nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Using an optically trapped microparticle driven by a tunable correlated stochastic force, we generate active-like steady states with controllable noise statistics. By abruptly changing the trap stiffness, we measure the stochastic work, heat, and entropy produced during NESS-to-NESS transformations. We identify a state-dependent effective temperature that restores the second law for these transitions, enabling the definition of a generalized work that incorporates the consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. With this quantity, we derive and experimentally verify a Crooks-like fluctuation relation linking work distributions to a nonequilibrium free-energy difference defined through the effective temperature. Finally, we establish a fluctuation-response relation for the positional variance following stiffness changes. We demonstrate that this relation is key to distinguishing systems that can be described by a unique effective temperature (i.e., those under equilibrium or white-noise conditions) from those under colored-noise, where an equilibrium-like response cannot be restored.

In this paper, we examine measurement using the Q-based, objective-field model for quantum mechanics. Schrodinger considered a microscopic system prepared in a superposition of states which is then coupled to a macroscopic meter. We analyze the entangled meter and system, and measurements on it, by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations for real amplitudes $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ that correspond to the phase-space variables of the Q function of the system at a time $t$. We model the system and meter as single-mode fields, and measurement of $\\hat{x}$ by amplification of the amplitude $x(t)$. Our conclusion is that the outcome for the measurement is determined at (or by) the time $t_{m}$, when the coupling to the meter is complete, the meter states being macroscopically distinguishable. There is consistency with macroscopic realism. By evaluating the distribution of the amplitudes $x$ and $p$ postselected on a given outcome of the meter, we show how the $Q$-based model represents a more complete description of quantum mechanics: The variances associated with amplitudes $x$ and $p$ are too narrow to comply with the uncertainty principle, ruling out that the distribution represents a quantum state. We conclude that the collapse of the wavefunction occurs as a two-stage process: First there is an amplification that creates branches of amplitudes $x(t)$ of the meter, associated with distinct eigenvalues. The outcome of measurement is determined by $x(t)$ once amplified, explaining Born's rule. Second, the distribution that determines the final collapse is the state inferred for the system conditioned on the outcome of the meter: information is lost about the meter, in particular, about the complementary variable $p$."}

Conventional QKD contains public classical post-processing steps that require authentication to prevent impersonation and maintain security. However, a major limitation of QKD is it cannot perform authentication by itself, and thus requires a separate authentication mechanism. In addition, these public classical steps also have information leakage which subjects QKD to additional attack strategies and reduces the final key rate. In this work, we propose a new QKD variant that removes the need for a separate authentication mechanism, eliminates information leakage, and achieves a substantially higher key rate. By having two more protocol keys than conventional QKD and no public classical steps, our design achieves (almost) perfect information-theoretic security with the protocol keys reusable."}

Starting from a one-dimensional interaction $V(x) = -g^2 e^{-αm x}/x$, we reformulate the problem in terms of a four-dimensional radial oscillator, where the finite screening length generates a systematic hierarchy of polynomial interactions in the radial coordinate. This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $ρ^4$, which appears at order $α^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We show that the entropy receives analytic corrections at order $α^2$, originating both from explicit anharmonic state-mixing effects and from the implicit $α$ dependence of the Gaussian width parameter. Our results clarify the distinct roles of harmonic renormalization and genuinely non-Gaussian interactions in generating entanglement, establish a systematic power-counting and normalization scheme for higher-order $ρ^{2n}$ perturbations, and provide a transparent oscillator-based framework for computing entanglement entropy in weakly interacting low-dimensional and field-theoretic systems."}

Similarly, in a Bell test using any given Bell inequality, the maximum violation achievable using quantum strategies respecting or disregarding a certain symmetry can be different. In this work, we focus on the symmetry involved in the exchange of parties and explore when we have to trade this symmetry for a lower-dimensional quantum strategy in achieving the maximal violation of given Bell inequalities. For the family of symmetric Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequalities, we provide evidence showing that there is no such trade-off. However, for several other Bell inequalities with a small number of dichotomic measurement settings, we show that symmetric quantum strategies in the minimal Hilbert space dimension can only lead to a suboptimal Bell violation. In other words, there exist symmetric Bell inequalities that can only be maximally violated by asymmetric quantum strategies of minimal dimension. In contrast, one can also find examples of asymmetric Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by symmetric correlations. The implications of these findings on the geometry of the set of quantum correlations and the possibility of performing self-testing therefrom are briefly discussed."}

At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling."}

Compared to other presentations, particular care has been given to disentangle aspects of tensor networks from the quantum many-body problem: MPO/MPS algorithms are presented as a way to deal with linear algebra on extremely (exponentially) large matrices and vectors, regardless of any particular application. The lectures include well-known algorithms to find eigenvectors of MPOs (the celebrated DMRG), solve linear problems, and recent learning algorithms that allow one to map a known function into an MPS (the Tensor Cross Interpolation, or TCI, algorithm). The lectures end with a discussion of how to represent functions and perform calculus with tensor networks using the \"quantics\" representation. They include the detailed analytical construction of important MPOs such as those for differentiation, indefinite integration, convolution, and the quantum Fourier transform. Three concrete applications are discussed in detail: the simulation of a quantum computer (either exactly or with compression), the simulation of a quantum annealer, and techniques to solve partial differential equations (e.g. Poisson, diffusion, or Gross-Pitaevskii) within the \"quantics\" representation. The lectures have been designed to be accessible to a first-year PhD student and include detailed proofs of all statements."}

Mishra", "Ujjwal Sen"], "title": "Collective dynamics versus entanglement in quantum battery performance", "comment": "13 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Identifying the physical origin of enhanced charging performance in many-body quantum batteries is a key challenge in quantum thermodynamics. We investigate whether improvements in stored energy and instantaneous charging power arise from genuine quantum correlations or from coherent collective dynamics that are not intrinsically quantum. We compare the time evolution of energetic quantities with a hierarchy of information-theoretic measures probing bipartite, tripartite, and further-partite correlations. Across different battery charger configurations, we find a consistent temporal ordering in which the instantaneous power peaks before the buildup of strong quantum correlations, indicating that peak charging is dominated by coherent transport, while entanglement and scrambling develop at later times. Furthermore, charging protocols based on k local interactions are examined under both unconstrained and norm-constrained (fair) settings, enabling a clear distinction between classical scaling effects and genuine collective enhancements. Increasing the interaction order or the participation number does not automatically translate into higher charging power. Instead, the performance is primarily dictated by how many particles actually become mutually correlated and contribute to entanglement. Fully collective interactions provide a genuine advantage because all particles participate coherently, whereas partially extended interaction schemes fail to monotonically increase the number of effectively interacting particles, and therefore do not guarantee improved charging efficiency."}

The landscape is very different for compiled unitaries, which arise from programming and typically have short circuits, as compared with generic unitaries, which use all parameters and typically require circuits of maximal size. We show that simple gradient descent reliably finds depth- and gate-optimal circuits for generic unitaries, including in the presence of restricted chip connectivity. This runs counter to earlier evidence that optimal synthesis required combinatorial search, and we show that this discrepancy can be explained by avoiding the random selection of certain parameter-deficient circuit skeletons."}

The system is analyzed within Carnot, Otto, and Stirling thermodynamic cycles, including the Stirling cycle with and without regeneration. We identify the conditions under which the device operates as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater. Efficiency maps and operational-mode diagrams reveal well-defined boundaries in parameter space, governed by the frequency ratio $r=\\barω/ω$, the coupling strength $g$, and the thermal gradient between reservoirs. The Carnot cycle exhibits sharp transitions between engine and refrigerator regimes, while the Otto cycle displays a richer structure with the coexistence of all operational modes. The Stirling cycle shows enhanced versatility and performance, particularly when assisted by a regenerator, where near-ideal efficiencies are achieved. Overall, the Raman-type interaction introduces a controllable left-right asymmetry that enables nontrivial manipulation of thermodynamic behavior through frequency tuning."}

The potential applications of this technology have been widely explored, and extensive research over the past decades has been dedicated to developing scalable quantum computers. However, the question of the energetic performance of quantum computation has only gained attention more recently, and its importance is now recognized. In fact, quantum computers can only be a viable alternative if their energy cost scales favorably, and some research has shown that there is even a potential quantum energy advantage. Rydberg atoms have emerged recently as one of the most promising platforms to implement a large-scale quantum computer, with significant advances made in recent years. This work aims at contributing first steps to understand the energy efficiency of this platform, namely by investigating the energy consumption of the different elements of a Rydberg atom quantum computer. First, an experimental implementation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is analyzed, and an estimation of the energetic cost of executing this algorithm is calculated. Then, a potential scaling of the energy cost of performing the Quantum Fourier Transform with Rydberg atoms is derived. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the energy consumption of different elements within a Rydberg atom quantum computer, from the preparation of the atoms to the execution of the algorithm, and the measurement of the final state, enabling the evaluation of the energy expenditure of the Rydberg platform and the identification of potential improvements. Finally, we used the Quantum Fourier Transform as an energetic benchmark, comparing the scaling we obtained to that of the execution of the Discrete Fourier Transform in two state-of-the-art classical supercomputers."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Quantum neural networks constitute a key class of near-term quantum learning models, yet their training dynamics remain not fully understood. Here, we present a unified theoretical framework for the frequency principle (F-principle) that characterizes the training dynamics of both classical and quantum neural networks. Within this framework, we prove that quantum neural networks exhibit a spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components of target functions, mirroring the behavior observed in classical deep networks. We further analyze the impact of noise and show that, when single-qubit noise is applied after encoding-layer rotations and modeled as a Pauli channel aligned with the rotation axis, the Fourier component labeled by $\\boldsymbolω$ is suppressed by a factor $(1-2γ)^{\\|\\boldsymbolω\\|_1}$. This leads to exponential attenuation of high-frequency terms while preserving the learnability of low-frequency structure. In the same setting, we establish that the resulting noisy circuits admit efficient classical simulation up to average-case error. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: Quantum neural networks primarily learn low-frequency features during early optimization and maintain robustness against dephasing and depolarizing noise acting on the encoding layer. Our results provide a frequency-domain lens that unifies classical and quantum learning dynamics, clarifies the role of noise in shaping trainability, and guides the design of noise-resilient quantum neural networks."}

We use the recent sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization method to compute low-energy states of the data Hamiltonians, whose parameters are trained to express classical datasets through local gradients.

Here we show that a nontrivial fixed point generically does exist in the $\\textit{complex}$ coupling plane and is described by a complex conformal field theory (CCFT). This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT. Since the CCFT vacuum is the eigenstate with the smallest decay rate, the system naturally relaxes under dissipative dynamics toward a CFT state, thus providing a route to preparing long-range entangled states through engineered dissipation."}

Using the driven Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and power-law interacting spin chains, we show that this effect persists up to a critical system size set by the breakdown of the high-frequency regime. We discuss optimal work output as well as experimentally accessible initial states. The superlinear charging effect can be probed in trapped-ion experiments, and positions interacting Floquet systems as promising platforms for enhanced energy conversion."}

Here, we show that in a parity-time (PT) symmetric system robust in-gap topological edge modes can be stably induced by non-Hermitian couplings that spontaneously break the PT symmetry of the eigenstates. The topological edge modes traverse the imaginary spectral gap between a pair of fragile topological bands, which is opened by the presence of the non-Hermitian perturbation. We demonstrate that the net number of resulting in-gap modes is protected by an operator version of anomaly cancellation that extends beyond the Hermitian limit. The results imply that loss and gain can in principle drive fragile topological phenomena to stable topological phenomena."}
