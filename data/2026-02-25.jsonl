Although constraint-solving techniques can overcome some limitations of traditional testing and verification, they have not yet been sufficiently explored in the context of quantum programs. To address this gap, we present QSolver, the first quantum constraint solver. QSolver provides a structured framework for handling five types of quantum constraints and incorporates an automated assertion generation module to verify quantum states. QSolver transforms quantum programs and multi-moment constraints into symbolic representations, and utilizes an SMT solver to obtain quantum states that satisfy these constraints. To validate the correctness of the generated input states, QSolver automatically generates assertion programs corresponding to each constraint. Experimental results show that QSolver efficiently processes commonly used quantum gates and demonstrates good scalability across quantum programs of different sizes."}

Accurate modeling of these phenomena requires precise ab initio data for high-energy decay channels, specifically photoabsorption and photoelectron emission. These are computationally difficult for classical methods due to prohibitive scaling in simulating electron dynamics, or due to the inability to resolve the ionization continuum in an efficient manner. In this work, we present quantum simulation algorithms to compute these key observables. First, we introduce a coherent time-domain spectroscopy algorithm optimized to resolve the photoabsorption cross-section at the 92 eV operating frequency. Second, we develop a first-quantized plane-wave simulation to compute the photoelectron kinetic energy spectrum, utilizing real-time dynamics and energy windowing to treat bound and delocalized scattering states on equal footing. Additionally, we provide logical resource estimation for a model photoresist monomer, 4-iodo-2-methylphenol (IMePh), and demonstrate that 92 eV absorption sensitivity can be resolved using roughly $200$ logical qubits and $10^{9}$ total non-Clifford gates per circuit with approximately $10^3$ shots for the smallest instance. The more sophisticated photoemission algorithm that models the continuum explicitly, incurs gate costs of $\\geq 10^{13}$ total non-Clifford gates per circuit, $10^4$ shots, and requires a few thousand logical qubits. These results establish high-fidelity quantum simulations as a key component to parameterize the multi-scale macroscopic models required to overcome the electron blur bottleneck in semiconductor miniaturization."}

We demonstrate by equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulations that such a temperature-dependent change in recall patterns does occur in our model.

The union-find (UF) decoder for the surface code is widely regarded as a promising candidate, offering almost-linear time complexity and favorable empirical error suppression supported by numerical evidence. However, the lack of a rigorous threshold theorem has left open whether the UF decoder can achieve fault tolerance beyond the error models and parameter regimes tested in numerical simulations. Here, we provide a rigorous proof of a finite threshold for the UF decoder on the surface code under the circuit-level local stochastic error model. To this end, we develop a refined error-clustering framework that extends techniques previously used to analyze cellular-automaton and renormalization-group decoders, by showing that error clusters can be separated by substantially larger buffers, thereby enabling analytical control over the behavior of the UF decoder. Using this guarantee, we further prove a quasi-polylogarithmic upper bound on the average runtime of a parallel UF decoder in terms of the code size. We also show that this framework yields a finite threshold for the greedy decoder, a simpler decoder with lower complexity but weaker empirical error suppression. These results provide a solid theoretical foundation for the practical use of UF-based decoders in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers, while offering a unified framework for studying fault tolerance across these practical decoders."}

Supplemental material included", "summary": "Protecting information against decoherence in open quantum systems remains a central challenge for quantum computing. In particular, passive error correction schemes have so far been limited to static memories rather than dynamical qubits. We demonstrate that a driven-dissipative bosonic system can encode a persistently oscillating qubit within a noiseless subsystem, realized explicitly in the Bose-Hubbard dimer (BHD). The strong parity symmetry of the model leads to degenerate stationary states. This symmetry is further broken into non-stationary states in the thermodynamic limit, which exhibit persistent oscillations. As the driving force increases, the Liouvillian spectrum of these states features a phase transition. Above the transition point, the non-stationary state encodes quantum information, preserving it in a noiseless subsystem. In addition to global loss that affects both bosonic modes identically, we further add global dephasing and show that the oscillating qubit is preserved. Finally, in order to gain additional physical insight, we study the effect of phase perturbation to both modes and observe that likewise they are passively protected, returning approximately to their initial configurations. These results establish dissipative time-crystalline dynamics as a mechanism for passive protection of dynamical quantum information, enabling autonomously stabilized oscillating qubits."}

However, the topological classification of systems respecting these symmetries, particularly for interacting fermions, remains incomplete. In this work, we systematically classify time-reversal symmetry-protected crystalline topological superconductors in two-dimensional interacting fermionic systems using an explicit real-space construction. Among the resulting phases, we identify intrinsically interacting fermionic topological superconductors, i.e., phases that cannot be realized in either free-fermion or interacting bosonic systems. For spinless fermions with protecting symmetry group $C_4 \\times Z_2^T$ or $D_4 \\times Z_2^T$ (plus fermion parity), the intrinsic sector has a $Z_4$ classification. The corresponding root phases generating this $Z_4$ classification admit a transparent real-space construction in terms of decorated 1D blocks. These blocks are 1D fermionic symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) phases, realizable as double Majorana chains. We further find the corresponding $Z_4$ spinless intrinsic phases for wallpaper groups $p4$, $p4m$, and $p4g$. We also find an additional $Z_2$ intrinsically interacting phase for spinless fermions with wallpaper group $pm$, which is absent with the corresponding point-group symmetry alone. Moreover, these intrinsic phases naturally give rise to higher-order FSPT phases that support corner zero modes. Finally, we verify the crystalline equivalence principle for generic 2D interacting FSPT systems with both crystalline and internal symmetries."}

In the adiabatic regime, we show that altermagnetic textures generate additional emergent electromagnetic fields and quantum-geometric effects that are absent in conventional magnetic systems. These effects include emergent Zeeman fields that encode the structure of the altermagnetic order parameter, enabling local spin manipulation and a way to distinguish different altermagnetic orders.

Using a non-perturbative Unitary Renormalization Group (URG) approach, we derive coupled renormalization-group flow equations for the Kondo exchange and the local field, and obtain a field-dependent RG phase diagram. The RG flows separate a low-energy Kondo-screened phase, where the impurity is absorbed into the Fermi sea and forms an entangled singlet with the conduction bath, from a polarized local-moment phase in which screening is frustrated and impurity-bath entanglement is suppressed. We identify the fixed-point Hamiltonians governing the two phases and the critical regime, and relate the transition to the emergence of a novel non-Fermi liquid. Various impurity signatures such as the spectral function and thermalisation of impurity observables are used to characterise this entanglement transition.

The latter manifests as a negated staggered pattern in the density-density correlations. While the single-particle and the pair correlation functions show highly localized correlations that decay rapidly away from the nearest neighbor. We show that the time scale of the domain-wall excitations depends on the inverse of the interaction strength and therefore dictates the slow relaxation dynamics. In the presence of a parabolic trap, the occupation dynamics at the edges become frozen and further suppresses the propagation of correlations. This suppression happens even for trap strengths weaker than the tunneling rate.

However, unlike conventional systems, inter-particle interactions along a synthetic dimension of harmonic trap states are inhomogeneous, long-ranged and non-state-preserving. Therefore, this setup provides a natural platform for the exploration of the interplay between long range interactions (including correlated pair tunneling) and magnetic effects.

Building on an analytical description of statistical mixtures, we derive an explicit expression for the size of a characteristic symmetry sector (CSS), defined as the largest subsequence of levels exhibiting non-Poissonian correlations. The CSS dimension is shown to be the size-biased average of the underlying symmetry sectors, establishing a direct link between spectral statistics and Hilbert-space structure. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic settings: Hilbert-space fragmentation and disorder-induced many-body localization (MBL). In fragmented systems, the CSS reproduces the mixture prediction and isolates correlated subsectors even when the full spectrum appears nearly Poissonian. In the disordered Heisenberg chain, spectral decimation reveals the gradual emergence of integrability through a shrinking CSS, whose statistics exhibit signatures consistent with local integrals of motion. We introduce a characteristic symmetry entropy (CSE) as a finite-size scaling observable and extract, within accessible system sizes, the crossover exponents. Our results establish spectral decimation as a controlled, unbiased and computationally inexpensive diagnostic of hidden structure in many-body spectra, capable of distinguishing between chaotic dynamics, statistical mixtures, and emergent integrability."}

Using mean-field theory and exact diagonalization, we investigate how this correlated process affects zero-temperature equilibrium and dynamical properties of the system. In equilibrium, we show that pair tunneling induces ground-state parity modulations and significantly reshapes the phase diagram, producing qualitative changes in the quantum phase transitions toward NOON and phase-NOON states, as well as quantitative shifts of the critical points. Out of equilibrium, we demonstrate that it modifies the conditions for macroscopic quantum self-trapping, and assess its impact by comparing mean-field and fully quantum evolution, including the emergence of dynamical quantum phase transitions."}

This lowest allowed quantum state is a superfluid state which has been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically. The method used for the current investigation is based on a recent series of papers that proposed microscopic dynamics based on normal modes to describe superfluidity instead of real-space Cooper pairs. This approach yielded excellent agreement with experimental data for multiple properties and allowed the microscopic behavior underlying these results as well as the basis of universal behavior to be analyzed in detail using the group theoretic basis of this general N-body approach. This microscopic picture is now used to illucidate the roles played by the uncertainty principle and the Pauli principle in determining the energy and character of the lowest allowed quantum state including the squeezed character of this superfluid state and the suppression of the Pauli principle."}

While two-dimensional anyons play a major role in strongly correlated systems and topological quantum computing, the nature of their one-dimensional (1D) counterparts remains the subject of intense debate, with renewed interest fueled by recent experimental progress. Theoretically, 1D anyons are predicted to host exotic many-body phases and quantum phase transitions, yet experimental signatures have remained elusive. Using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, we prepare two-body ground states of the 1D anyon-Hubbard model by combining Hamiltonian engineering via quasiperiodic drives and adiabatic state manipulation. We uncover the effects of statistical interactions that lead to pseudo-fermionization and to the formation of chiral bound states when particles remain close together. Our results establish a link between lattice and continuum realizations of anyon models, and mark important steps towards the precise control of 1D anyons in both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium settings."}

We show that the occupation dynamics at strong interactions is dominated by doublon-holon exchange which leads to a domain wall excitation and propagation. The latter manifests as a negated staggered pattern in the density-density correlations. While the single-particle and the pair correlation functions show highly localized correlations that decay rapidly away from the nearest neighbor. We show that the time scale of the domain-wall excitations depends on the inverse of the interaction strength and therefore dictates the slow relaxation dynamics. In the presence of a parabolic trap, the occupation dynamics at the edges become frozen and further suppresses the propagation of correlations. This suppression happens even for trap strengths weaker than the tunneling rate. We also show that the model can be mapped to an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model in the limit of strong interactions and that the correlation-propagation velocity in the original model is well captured by the group velocity of the spin-wave excitation in the effective spin model."}
