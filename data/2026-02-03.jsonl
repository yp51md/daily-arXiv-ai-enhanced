More information and the latest version can be found at https://www.physik.uni-kl.de/eggert/papers/", "summary": "We analyze mechanisms for universal out-of-equilibrium dynamics near criticality by exploring the effect of randomized quantum resetting (QR) under a finite-time quench across a quantum phase transition. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a generic model and exploiting its exact solution, QR is found to cause a crossover of the scaling of the topological defect density with the time scale $τ$ of the quench, from Kibble-Zurek to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling as $τ$ increases. This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise."}

We show how a metadynamics free energy barrier must be carefully postprocessed so that classical nucleation theory can be applied to calculate nucleation rates. We apply our procedure to a Yukawa plasma and show that a particular physically-motivated fit to metadynamics data reproduces low-temperature reference data, justifying the usefulness of metadynamics to predict nucleation rates and the nucleation critical temperature."}

Above the upper critical dimension of four, the mean-field solution with a robust $3/2$ size exponent describes the dynamics. In two and three dimensions, spatial constraints yield smaller yet robust exponent values governed by universality classes. However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation. While the first critical regime exhibits an inherently memoryless behavior, both the transition and the second regime are driven by memory effects provoked by the growth of avalanches over the traces left by previous events, due to dissipative mechanisms. The system hovers at a distance $d_{cp}$ from the critical point, and accounting for a power-law distribution of $d_{cp}$, validated by susceptibility measurements, captures the transition. This framework provides a unified description of both critical and quasi-critical behavior, and thus of the full spectrum of scale-free dynamics observed in nature."}

However, ensuring the correctness of these libraries remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of mature testing methodologies. The state-of-the-art tools often rely on domain-specific configurations and expert knowledge, which limits their accessibility and scalability in practice. Furthermore, although these tools demonstrate strong performance, they adopt measurement-based for output validation in testing, which makes them produce false positive reports.\n  To alleviate these limitations, we propose QSPE, a practical approach that follows the differential testing principle and extends the existing approach, SPE, for quantum libraries. QSPE is fully automated, requiring no pre-set configurations or domain expertise, and can effectively generate a large set of diverse program variants that comprehensively explore the quantum compilation space. To mitigate the possible false positive reports, we propose statevector-based validation as an alternative to measurement-based validation. In our experiments, the QSPE approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in generating 22,770 program variants across multiple quantum computing platforms. By avoiding $α$-equivalence at the quantum and classical program wise, QSPE can reduce redundant generation and save more than 90\\% of execution cost. Finally, the statevector-based validation method assists QSPE to reduce false alarms and effectively detects 708 miscompilations across multiple quantum libraries. Notably, 81 of the discovered bugs have been officially approved and acknowledged by the Qiskit development team, demonstrating the practical impact of our approach."}

(12 pages); 2+2 figures", "summary": "Phase transitions occur when a macroscopic number of local degrees of freedom coherently change their behavior. In ground states of quantum many-body systems, phase transitions due to quantum fluctuations are observed as non-analytic behaviors of order parameters, such as magnetization, as functions of a conjugate parameter, such as the magnetic field. However, as soon as thermal fluctuations are present, these effects are believed to disappear for local observables. We show that this is not necessarily the case: order parameters may still show non-analytic behaviors within their dynamics. With the example of the Ising model and using methods based on hydrodynamic fluctuations, we evaluate the exact order-parameter correlation time, in space-time directions of all velocities, in equilibrium states at nonzero temperature. We reveal non-analytic behaviors of spin correlation times as functions of the magnetic field, velocity, and temperature. As a function of the magnetic field, they occur at values that continuously approach that of the zero-temperature equilibrium transition point as the velocity is decreased and reach it within the light cone, where we obtain a new, temperature-independent logarithmic divergence characterizing the collective dynamics. Thus, collective effects induced by quantum fluctuations persist within the dynamics of local observables."}

Quantum Computing (QC), which exploits quantum mechanisms for computation, has attracted growing attention and significant global investment as it may address these challenges. Consequently, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the integration of these two fields, has received increasing interest, with a notable rise in related studies in recent years. We are motivated to review these existing contributions regarding quantum circuit-based learning models for classical data analysis and highlight the identified potentials and challenges of this technique. Specifically, we focus not only on QML models, both kernel-based and neural network-based, but also on recent explorations of their integration with classical machine learning layers within hybrid frameworks. Moreover, we examine both theoretical analysis and empirical findings to better understand their capabilities, and we also discuss the efforts on noise-resilient and hardware-efficient QML that could enhance its practicality under current hardware limitations. In addition, we cover several emerging paradigms for advanced quantum circuit design and highlight the adaptability of QML across representative application domains.

Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster."}

By balancing interface energy against configurational entropy, we show that the critical temperature is determined by the ratio of the coordination-dependent energy cost to the logarithm of a total multiplicity factor. This factor decomposes into a lattice-topological constant, representing a projection from an underlying orthogonal Euclidean space, and a term representing Markovian sampling in the $q$-dimensional state space. The framework recovers exact solutions for two-dimensional square, triangular, and honeycomb lattices and achieves sub-3\\% accuracy for three-dimensional simple cubic, bcc, fcc, and diamond geometries. This approach unifies the Potts universality class into a single geometric classification, revealing that the phase transition is governed by the saturation of interface propagation through the lattice manifold and providing a predictive tool that characterizes the entire $q$-state family from a single topological calibration."}

Although these networks are being deployed worldwide, no protocol exists which provides provable guarantees of integrity against manipulation from both external adversaries and corrupted intermediates. In this work, we present the first protocol that provably provides both confidentiality and integrity. Our protocol combines an existing cryptographic technique, Algebraic Manipulation Detection (AMD) codes, with multi-path relaying over trusted repeater networks.

Using full 3D simulations in cylindrical coordinates, combined with a semi-analytical energy analysis, we show that the vortex preferentially splits along the long axis of the trap, a direction that minimizes the kinetic-energy cost relative to the initial TQV state. Systematic parameter scans reveal that initial quantum fluctuations increase the splitting time and suppress the transient three-core pattern observed in noise-free simulations, whereas stronger nonlinear interactions accelerate the splitting. When the trap is nearly isotropic, the unstable Bogoliubov modes are dominated by both azimuthal quantum number $l_q=3$ and $l_q=2$; this leads to a dynamical sequence where three daughter vortices first form a triangular arrangement, later evolving into a linear chain. For stronger anisotropy, geometric coupling selectively enhances the $l_q=2$ mode, making it the sole dominant channel and resulting directly in linear vortex alignment -- a clear signature of geometry-induced mode competition explained through combined energy-based and Bogoliubov stability analysis. Our results provide a quantitative picture of how trap geometry can steer the instability pathway, splitting time, and final pattern of a multiply quantized vortex, offering a route toward geometry-controlled vortex engineering."}

These landscapes are shaped not only by local interactions, but crucially also by the global loop structure of the graph. The famous Bethe approximation treats the graph as a tree, effectively ignoring global structure, thereby limiting its effectiveness for optimization. Loop expansions capture such global structure in principle, but are often impractical due to combinatorial explosion. The $M$-layer construction provides an alternative: make $M$ copies of the graph and reconnect edges between them uniformly at random. This provides a controlled sequence of approximations from the original graph at $M=1$, to the Bethe approximation as $M \\rightarrow \\infty$. Here we generalize this construction by replacing uniform random rewiring with a structured mixing kernel $Q$ that sets the probability that any two layers are interconnected. As a result, the global loop structure can be shaped without modifying local interactions. We show that, after this copy-and-reconnect transformation, there exists a regime in which layer-to-layer fluctuations decay, increasing the probability of reaching the global minimum of the energy function of the original graph. This yields a highly general and practical tool for optimization. Using this approach, the computational cost required to reach these optimal solutions is reduced across sparse and dense Ising benchmarks, including spin glasses and planted instances. When combined with replica-exchange Monte Carlo, the same construction increases the polynomial-time algorithmic threshold for the maximum independent set problem. A cavity analysis shows that structured inter-layer coupling significantly smooths rugged energy landscapes by collapsing configurational complexity and suppressing many suboptimal metastable states."}

This intrinsic phase, in which antiparallel spins reside on distinct orbitals, is realized across all four 2D Bravais lattices. It is driven by orbital-resolved spin fluctuations enhanced by inter-orbital hopping and favors suppressed Hund's coupling $J_H$, strong inter-orbital hybridization, and filling near a VHS from quadratic band touching.

Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods."}

A critical step in any genome sequencing technique is genome assembly. However, de novo genome assembly, which involves constructing an entire genome sequence from scratch without a reference genome, presents significant challenges due to its high computational complexity, affecting both time and accuracy. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach utilizing a quantum computing-based optimization algorithm integrated with classical pre-processing to expedite the genome assembly process. Specifically, we present a method to solve the Hamiltonian and Eulerian paths within the genome assembly graph using gate-based quantum computing through a Higher-Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulation with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm (VQE), in addition to a novel bitstring recovery mechanism to improve optimizer traversal of the solution space. A comparative analysis with classical optimization techniques was performed to assess the effectiveness of our quantum-based approach in genome assembly. The results indicate that, as quantum hardware continues to evolve and noise levels diminish, our formulation holds a significant potential to accelerate genome sequencing by offering faster and more accurate solutions to the complex challenges in genomic research."}

In a separate vein, linearized CC methods have drawn interest for their lower computational cost, increased parallelizability, and favorable properties for extension to the excited state--but the inclusion of ring/crossed-ring terms causes singularities even for single bond breaking. A linearized, addition-by-subtraction CC method called linearized ladder CCD (linLCCD) removes these terms to avoid divergences, but linLCCD under-estimates dynamical correlation. Herein we resolve this deficiency of linLCCD by introducing a linearized external coupled cluster perturbation theory that adds a second-order ring/crossed-ring correction back into a linLCCD reference wave function.

In homogeneous structures, the fact that a unit cell repeats itself along at least one direction can be leveraged to minimize the number of atoms considered and the calculation time. However, such an approach does not lend itself to amorphous or defective materials for which no periodicity exists. In these cases, (much) larger domains containing thousands of atoms might be needed to accurately describe the physics at play, pushing DFT tools to their limit. Here we address this issue by learning and directly predicting the Hamiltonian matrix of large structures through equivariant graph neural networks and so-called augmented partitioning training.

For class A in two spatial dimensions, we find a general inequality linking the Floquet quantum metric tensor and the Floquet topology: the associated quantum volume is bounded below by the Floquet topological invariant.

This prediction is verified across canonical unimodal families and heterogeneous triadic ensembles, with Lyapunov spectra corroborating the one-dimensional reduction. A derivative condition on the activation kernel fixes the local nonlinearity order $z$ (and thus, under standard unimodal-map hypotheses, the associated $z$-logistic universality class) and gives conditions under which $z>2$ can be realized.

We derive an evolution equation for the moment generating function for this work, faithfully capturing the thermodynamic signature of coherent superpositions in the initial ensemble. We demonstrate that different initial ensembles that correspond to the same density matrix upon ensemble average, while having the same average work, display different work fluctuations. For monotonic driving, we show that fluctuations are maximum for coherence-less initial ensembles. As an application, we consider quantum bit-erasure in finite time and demonstrate significantly different work statistics for erasing a classical bit of information versus a Haar random initial ensemble. Our results indicate that coherence in the initial ensemble can be utilized as a resource for thermodynamic precision without incurring additional dissipative work costs.

This introduces a novel barrier mechanism: quantum pressure creates an effective barrier inside the vortex channel, set by the constriction width, which controls the superflow. Tuning the interspecies interaction strength drives a crossover from the hydrodynamic transport to Josephson tunneling regime. Long-range dipolar interactions further tune the weak-link properties, enabling both short links and two coupled junctions in series.

Exact diagonalization shows that quenching hopping in one layer generates an interaction-induced mosaic potential with multiple mobility edges.

Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime."}

Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $χ(\\mathbf{q},ω)$.

To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q < 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q > 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works.

However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation. While the first critical regime exhibits an inherently memoryless behavior, both the transition and the second regime are driven by memory effects provoked by the growth of avalanches over the traces left by previous events, due to dissipative mechanisms.

Studying such confined transport requires both precise electrical instrumentation and careful data analysis, yet, in practice, measurements are still often taken with vendor software, exported as files, and processed later in separate environments. In this work, we bring these steps together in a unified Python-based framework built around three interoperable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for nanochannel, nanopore and memristor experiments. The framework is organised into two functional parts, measurement and analysis. On the measurement side, two GUIs drive Keithley Source Meters to run continuous voltage sweeps and user-defined memristive pulse sequences, while providing live plots, configuration management and controlled shutdown routines. On the analysis side, a dedicated nanochannel and nanopore GUI reads raw I-V datasets, applies unit-consistent processing, extracts conductance and ion mobility, evaluates selectivity and osmotic power, and is complemented by a web-based calculator that performs the same mobility analysis without a local Python installation. All three GUIs are implemented in Python/Tkinter with modular plotting and logging layers so that flexible control sequences and physics-based post-processing share a common data format, improving reproducibility, timing stability and day-to-day efficiency in nanofluidic and electronic device studies."}

This naturally shifts attention from exogenous narratives to endogenous dynamics: interactions, feedback loops, and collective amplification mechanisms that can make systems intrinsically {\\it fragile}. We argue that the importation of concepts from statistical physics -- criticality, disorder, emergence, multiplicative cascades -- should be read not as an artificial transposition but as a candid attempt to look for generic mechanisms compatible with empirical regularities observed across scales, from markets to macroeconomic aggregates."}

Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions."}

This prediction is verified across canonical unimodal families and heterogeneous triadic ensembles, with Lyapunov spectra corroborating the one-dimensional reduction. A derivative condition on the activation kernel fixes the local nonlinearity order $z$ (and thus, under standard unimodal-map hypotheses, the associated $z$-logistic universality class) and gives conditions under which $z>2$ can be realized. The diagnostic operates directly on orbit data under standard regularity assumptions, providing a practical tool to classify universality in higher-order networks."}

In the bulk the RTP tumbles at a constant rate $α>0$ between velocity states $\\pm v$ with $v>0$ and randomly resets to its initial position and orientation $(x_0,k_0)\\in(\\mathbb{R}^+,\\pm)$. When the RTP reaches the target at $x=0$ it attaches to the boundary for a random waiting time before either detaching and continuing to navigate the bulk domain or (permanently) entering the target. These events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption, and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. We use renewal theory to characterize the particle trajectory in terms of successive binding events under two distinct desorption protocols: via resetting to $(x_0,k_0)$ and via continuous movement from $x=0$ with velocity $+v$. First we derive the nonequilibrum stationary state (NESS) in the case of no absorption and characterize the accumulation at the boundary. Second, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) statistics. In addition to observing the usual unimodal dependence of the MFPT on bulk resetting, both the NESS and MFPT strongly depend on the initial orientation $k_0$ and the desorption protocol. For instance, if the initial orientation is toward the boundary, we find that the desorption-induced resetting protocol can reduce the MFPT more effectively than the non-resetting desorption protocol. We also show how matching the desorption kinetics with the bulk resetting or tumbling rate introduces a trade-off between minimizing the adsorption and absorption times. In this setting we find that the desorption protocol which minimizes the absorption MFPT for a given set of parameters is almost always the opposite of that favored when desorption and bulk kinetics are not the same."}

Although the spectral properties of the chaotic phase in the tilted Bose-Hubbard model have been well characterized, the corresponding dynamical signatures across the transition to regularity remain less explored . In this work, we investigate this transition by analyzing the time evolution of the survival probability, the single-site entanglement entropy, and the half-chain imbalance. Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics."}

The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in disordered systems such as the diffusion length and the localization length. However, in disordered systems with vanishing or nearly vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain what determines the important length scales in such systems. In this work, we use the 1D Lieb lattice with isolated flat bands as an example to show that the quantum metric length (QML) is a fundamental length scale in the ballistic, diffusive and localization regimes. The QML is defined through the Bloch state wave functions of the flat bands. In the ballistic regime with short junctions, the QML controls the finite energy transport properties. In the localization regime with long junctions, the localization length is determined by the QML and remarkably, independent of disorder strength over a wide range of disorder strength. We call this unconventional localization regime, the quantum metric localization regime. In the diffusive regime, we demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient is linearly proportional to the QML via the wave-packet dynamics numerically. Importantly, the numerical results are consistent with the analytical results obtained through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We conclude that the QML is a fundamentally important length scale governing the properties of disordered flat band materials."}

As an application, we consider quantum bit-erasure in finite time and demonstrate significantly different work statistics for erasing a classical bit of information versus a Haar random initial ensemble. Our results indicate that coherence in the initial ensemble can be utilized as a resource for thermodynamic precision without incurring additional dissipative work costs.

Different from traditional parametrically induced magnons with degenerate frequencies, we achieve non-degenerate excitations by coupling magnon modes simultaneously with two cavity photon modes.

This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise."}

Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems."}

A rigorous method, based on Grassmann variables and coherent states, is constructed to obtain a closed-form expression for the fermionic star-exponential from its associated propagator. As a primary application, a fermionic version of the Feynman-Kac formula is derived within this formalism, allowing for the calculation of the ground state energy directly in phase space.

Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $η$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO.

Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate.

We find only 5 of the 230 space groups host Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons. Notably, the Dirac nodal line resides along the high-symmetry line, whereas the Weyl nodal line is distributed on the high-symmetry plane and is interconnected with the Dirac nodal line, jointly forming a composite nodal network structure. Unlike traditional nodal nets, this nodal network exhibits markedly distinct surface states on different surfaces, which can be attributed to the fundamental differences in the topological properties between the Weyl and Dirac nodal lines. This unique property thus allows the material to present distinct surface states in a termination-selective manner. Furthermore, by first-principles calculations, we identify the materials NdRhO$_{3}$ and ZnSe$_{2}$O$_{5}$ as candidate examples to elaborate the Weyl-Dirac nodal line and their related topological features.

Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity.

In ground states of quantum many-body systems, phase transitions due to quantum fluctuations are observed as non-analytic behaviors of order parameters, such as magnetization, as functions of a conjugate parameter, such as the magnetic field. However, as soon as thermal fluctuations are present, these effects are believed to disappear for local observables. We show that this is not necessarily the case: order parameters may still show non-analytic behaviors within their dynamics. With the example of the Ising model and using methods based on hydrodynamic fluctuations, we evaluate the exact order-parameter correlation time, in space-time directions of all velocities, in equilibrium states at nonzero temperature. We reveal non-analytic behaviors of spin correlation times as functions of the magnetic field, velocity, and temperature. As a function of the magnetic field, they occur at values that continuously approach that of the zero-temperature equilibrium transition point as the velocity is decreased and reach it within the light cone, where we obtain a new, temperature-independent logarithmic divergence characterizing the collective dynamics.

Pushing improvements in the optimizer and learning rates, and introducing physics-informed output activations that can resolve extremely small wave-function amplitudes, we achieve ground-state energy errors reduced by orders of magnitude and wave-function fidelities exceeding 99%. We further assess physical relevance by analysing generalized inverse participation ratios and multifractal dimensions for ground and excited states in one and two dimensions, demonstrating that optimized ML models reproduce localization, delocalization, and multifractality trends across the spectrum. Crucially, these qualitative predictions remain robust across four decades of the interaction strength, e.g. spanning across superfluid, Mott-insulating, as well as quantum chaotic regimes. Together, these results suggest ML as a viable qualitative predictor of many-body structure, complementing the quantitative strengths of exact diagonalization and tensor-network methods."}

By exactly solving the quasiperiodic cluster-Ising chain, we unambiguously demonstrate that all phase boundaries separating quasiperiodically modulated phases are governed by a new family of topological Ising-like fixed points unique to strongly modulated quasiperiodic systems: Despite exhibiting indistinguishable bulk critical properties, these fixed points host robust topological edge degeneracies and are therefore topologically distinct from previously recognized quasiperiodic universality classes, as further supported by complementary lattice simulations."}

These landscapes are shaped not only by local interactions, but crucially also by the global loop structure of the graph. The famous Bethe approximation treats the graph as a tree, effectively ignoring global structure, thereby limiting its effectiveness for optimization. Loop expansions capture such global structure in principle, but are often impractical due to combinatorial explosion. The $M$-layer construction provides an alternative: make $M$ copies of the graph and reconnect edges between them uniformly at random. This provides a controlled sequence of approximations from the original graph at $M=1$, to the Bethe approximation as $M \\rightarrow \\infty$. Here we generalize this construction by replacing uniform random rewiring with a structured mixing kernel $Q$ that sets the probability that any two layers are interconnected. As a result, the global loop structure can be shaped without modifying local interactions. We show that, after this copy-and-reconnect transformation, there exists a regime in which layer-to-layer fluctuations decay, increasing the probability of reaching the global minimum of the energy function of the original graph. This yields a highly general and practical tool for optimization. Using this approach, the computational cost required to reach these optimal solutions is reduced across sparse and dense Ising benchmarks, including spin glasses and planted instances. When combined with replica-exchange Monte Carlo, the same construction increases the polynomial-time algorithmic threshold for the maximum independent set problem. A cavity analysis shows that structured inter-layer coupling significantly smooths rugged energy landscapes by collapsing configurational complexity and suppressing many suboptimal metastable states."}

Despite these parallel perspectives, the relation between LGC and BIC formation has remained largely unexplored. Here we bridge this gap in a paradigmatic giant-atom waveguide platform and show that the occurrence of LGC necessarily benchmarks the presence of a BIC in the full Hamiltonian description. By engineering the giant-atom geometry, we further demonstrate rich dynamical regimes-including Rabi oscillations, fractional decay, and complete exponential relaxation-depending on the number of supported BICs, which can be tuned from three to zero. Remarkably, when two BICs become frequency-degenerate, the long-time dynamics approaches a steady state rather than exhibiting persistent oscillations.

Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems.

Here we derive rigorous bounds on the Hilbert-Schmidt fidelity between mixed states by combining a mixed-state quantum speed limit with mixed-state fidelity susceptibility within the Liouville space formulation of quantum mechanics. Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate.

Under these conditions, the stationary continuity constraint induces a nonlinear amplitude equation of Ermakov Pinney type in each degree of freedom, revealing a hidden invariant structure that is independent of whether the evolution parameter is time or space.\n  By reformulating the separated stationary equations in Sturm Liouville form and applying Liouville normalization, we demonstrate that the quantum potential is encoded as a curvature contribution of the self adjoint operator rather than appearing as an additional dynamical term. This correspondence preserves the standard probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics while yielding exact stationary Bohmian amplitudes and their associated invariants. The resulting invariant-based formulation provides stationary guiding fields and clarifies the ontological status of Bohmian amplitudes as geometrically encoded structures rather than auxiliary dynamical additions. The results further show that stationary constrained Bohm Madelung systems naturally admit variational formulations whose extremals preserve the Ermakov Lewis invariant."}

We extend these bounds to higher-order Suzuki formulas, where the improvement factor involves $2^{pS^*/2}$ for the $p$-th order formula. We further establish a separation result demonstrating that volume-law entangled systems fundamentally require $\\tildeΩ(n)$ more Trotter steps than area-law systems to achieve the same precision. This separation is tight up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis combines Lieb-Robinson bounds for locality, tensor network representations for entanglement structure, and novel commutator-entropy inequalities that bound the expectation value of nested commutators by the Schmidt rank of the state.

However, the extreme miniaturization and high mechanical compliance that make graphene attractive also render it highly susceptible to nonlinearities, degrading frequency stability. Here, we demonstrate that graphene parametric oscillators provide an alternative nonlinear operating regime, where short-term frequency stability can be enhanced despite strong nonlinearity. By operating graphene resonators in a phase-locked loop (PLL), we experimentally demonstrate that parametric oscillations in the post-bifurcation regime achieve lower Allan deviation at fast integration times than Duffing oscillations at identical amplitudes. This improvement originates from strong nonlinear damping inherent to parametric oscillators, which suppresses amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion at large amplitudes. A minimal theoretical model captures observed phase diffusion and identifies nonlinear damping as the dominant mechanism governing phase noise reduction. These results highlight the role of nonlinear dissipation in enabling precision sensing beyond conventional limits of graphene oscillators."}

But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings."}

For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature.

Single-NV scanning magnetometry achieves genuine nanoscale resolution, nonetheless requires typically a slow pixel-by-pixel acquisition. Meanwhile, wide-field NV-ensemble microscopy provides parallel readout over a large field of view, however is jointly limited by the optical diffraction limit and the sensor-sample standoff. Here, we present a sparse-sampling strategy for reconstructing high-resolution wide-field images from only a small number of measurements. Using simulated NV-ensemble detection of ac magnetic fields, we show that a mean-adjusted Bayesian estimation (MABE) framework can reconstruct 10000-pixel images from only 25 sampling points, achieving SSIM values exceeding 0.999 for representative smooth field distributions, while optimized dynamical-decoupling pulse sequences yield an approximately twofold improvement in magnetic-field sensitivity. The method further clarifies how sampling patterns and sampling density affect reconstruction accuracy and suggests a route toward faster and more scalable magnetic-imaging architectures that may extend to point-scanning NV sensors and other magnetometry platforms, such as SQUIDs, Hall probes, and magnetic tunnel junctions."}

In this work, we quantify the entrywise resolvability of the Hessian for Variational Quantum Algorithms at random initialization. By leveraging exact second-order parameter-shift rules, we derive a structural representation that reduces the variance of Hessian entries to a finite covariance quadratic form of shifted cost evaluations. This framework reveals two distinct scaling regimes that govern the sample complexity required to resolve Hessian entries against shot noise. For global objectives, we prove that Hessian variances are exponentially suppressed, implying that the number of measurement shots must scale as $O(e^{αn})$ with the number of qubits $n$ to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, for termwise local objectives in bounded-depth circuits, the variance decay is polynomial and explicitly controlled by the backward lightcone growth on the interaction graph, ensuring that curvature information remains statistically accessible with $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ shots. Extensive numerical experiments across varying system sizes and circuit depths demonstrate these theoretical bounds and the associated sampling costs.

Here we characterize the most general forms of input-output indefiniteness, associated with a hierarchy of higher-order transformations built from transformations of bistochastic quantum channels. Some levels of the hierarchy correspond to transformations that combine bistochastic channels in a definite causal order, while generally using each channel in an indefinite input-output direction. For other levels of the hierarchy, the indefiniteness can involve both the local input-output direction of each process and the global causal order among the processes.

Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions."}

We demonstrate that the proposed definition naturally decomposes into a Clausius-type entropy production and an additional contribution arising from the time dependence of the effective temperature. Furthermore, we show that requiring the entropy production rate to take the conventional form as the sum of the entropy change and the heat flow constrains the effective temperature to be either constant or equal to a specific energy-matching effective temperature. For general initial states, entropy production can become negative, in which case we derive lower bounds on entropy production and establish sufficient conditions for its non-negativity using the trace distance."}

By introducing an auxiliary operator, we convert the history-dependent work variance into a time-local integral, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization beyond slow or rapid driving regimes. Applying our method, we find that in the coherent spin-boson model the optimized protocol can switch discontinuously between distinct locally optimal solutions as the relative weight between dissipation and fluctuations is varied. Moreover, for a single-level quantum dot coupled to a fermionic reservoir, the optimized fluctuation-minimizing protocol develops a qualitatively different multi-step structure that is not captured by approaches based on slow- or rapid-driving limits."}

As a result, our method enables the target simulation precision to be reached with approximately half the circuit depth compared to conventional MPF schemes.

But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings."}

A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems."}

This correspondence has been used to establish the classical hardness of simulating interacting spin systems by relating their output distributions to #P-hard quantities. Previous works, however, have largely been restricted to bipartite spin interactions, where transition amplitudes, which provide the leading-order contribution to the output probabilities, are proportional to the permanent. In this work, we extend the Ising model construction to arbitrary interaction networks and show that transition amplitudes of the Ising Hamiltonian are proportional to the hafnian and the loop-hafnian. The loop-hafnian generalizes both the permanent and hafnian, but unlike these cases, loop-hafnian-based states require Dicke-like superpositions, making the design of corresponding quantum circuits non-trivial. Our results establish a unified framework linking bosonic networks of single photons and Gaussian states with quantum spin dynamics and matrix functions. This unification not only broadens the theoretical foundation of quantum circuit models but also highlights new, diverse, and classically intractable applications."}

In this structure, the number of repetitions of the basic circuit pattern is associated to convergence parameters. This iterative structure behaves similarly to function approximation by series expansion: the higher the truncation order, the better the target gate (i.e. operation) approximation. The asymptotic convergence of the gate error with respect to the number of basic pattern repetitions is known. It is referred to as the query complexity. The underlying convergence law is bounded, but not in an explicit fashion. Upper bounds are generally too pessimistic to be useful in practice. The actual convergence law contains constants that depend on the joint properties of the matrix encoded by the query and the initial state vector, which are difficult to compute classically. This paper proposes a strategy to study this convergence law and extract the associated constants from the gate (operation) approximation at different accuracy (convergence parameter) constructed directly on a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). This protocol is called Numerical Error Extraction by Quantum Measurement Algorithm (NEEQMA). NEEQMA concepts are tested on specific instances of Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Hamiltonian Simulation by Trotterization. Knowing theexact convergence constants allows for selecting the smallest convergence parameters that enable reaching the required gate approximation accuracy, hence satisfying the quantum algorithm's requirements."}

Here, we construct and investigate a Liouvillian exceptional structure based on a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit. Through numerical simulations, we reveal a quantum phase transition occurring at the LEP characterized by a sudden change in dynamical behavior from underdamped oscillations to overdamped relaxations as visualized via Wigner functions and Bloch sphere trajectories. Notably the negativity of the Wigner function serves as a direct signature of genuine quantum coherence unattainable in conventional single-qubit non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we introduce the phase difference between the off-diagonal elements of the Liouvillian eigenmatrices as a novel parameter to quantify the transition.

Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate.

A critical bottleneck in this context is how to load classical or quantum data into quantum circuits efficiently. Approximate quantum loaders (AQLs) provide a viable solution to this problem by balancing fidelity and circuit complexity. However, most existing AQL methods are either heuristic or provide guarantees only for specific input types, and a general theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this gap, here we reformulate most AQL methods into a unified framework and establish information-theoretic bounds on their approximation error. Our analysis reveals that the achievable infidelity between the prepared state and target state scales linearly with the total entanglement entropy across subsystems when the loading circuit is applied to the target state. In light of this, we develop AQER, a scalable AQL method that constructs the loading circuit by systematically reducing entanglement in target states. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AQER, using synthetic datasets, classical image and language datasets, and a quantum many-body state datasets with up to 50 qubits.

If the recording is of events in which quantum uncertainty plays a role, such as an experiment on a quantum system, quantum theory is unable to correctly predict the probabilities of both future and past states of the recording. The nature of this difficulty will be laid out at the outset. A resolution then will be presented, in which the Born rule will be lightly amended so as to correctly predict all probabilities. The resolution will have the further benefit of clarifying how quantum theory applies to an array of situations in which the theory can be ambiguous, such as the descriptions of continuous measurements, and of closed systems containing all observers."}

Tensor networks are an invaluable tool for efficiently representing states of large quantum systems with limited entanglement. Algorithms for sampling one-dimensional (1D) tensor networks are well-established and utilized in several 1D tensor network methods. In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of algorithms for 1D tensor networks. The first algorithm we propose performs independent sampling and yields a single configuration together with its associated probability. The second algorithm employs a greedy search strategy to identify K high-probability configurations and their corresponding probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms across quantum states with varying entanglement and system size."}

This task has recently attracted significant attention, as the secure instantiation of many isogeny-based cryptographic protocols relies on the ability to sample such ``hard'' curves. Existing approaches, however, achieve this only in a trusted-setup setting. We present the first provable quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples a random hard supersingular elliptic curve with high probability.Our algorithm runs heuristically in $\\tilde{O}\\!\\left(\\log^{4}p\\right)$ quantum gate complexity and in $\\tilde{O}\\!\\left(\\log^{13} p\\right)$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. As a consequence, our algorithm gives a secure instantiation of the CGL hash function and other cryptographic primitives.\n  Our analysis relies on a new spectral delocalization result for supersingular $\\ell$-isogeny graphs: we prove the Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture, and we further provide numerical evidence for complete eigenvector delocalization; this theoretical result may be of independent interest. Along the way, we prove a stronger $\\varepsilon$-separation property for eigenvalues of isogeny graphs than that predicted in the quantum money protocol of Kane, Sharif, and Silverberg, thereby removing a key heuristic assumption in their construction."}

These two-spin techniques are widely used to create nonequilibrium nuclear spin states having polarization far beyond its equilibrium value. OE is commonly encountered in liquids, and SE is a solid-state technique. Here, we report a single framework based on a recently proposed quantum master equation, to explain both OE and SE. To this end, we use a fluctuation-regularized quantum master equation that predicts dipolar relaxation and drive-induced dissipation, in addition to the standard environmental dissipation channels. Importantly, this unified approach predicts the existence of optimal microwave drive amplitudes that maximize the OE and SE enhancements. We also report optimal enhancement regime for electron-nuclear coupling for maximal enhancement."}

Although quantum noise is often viewed as a major challenge in quantum computing, it also offers a unique opportunity to enhance privacy. In particular, intrinsic quantum noise provides a natural stochastic resource that, when rigorously analyzed within the differential privacy (DP) framework and composed with classical mechanisms, can satisfy formal $(\\varepsilon, δ)$-DP guarantees. This enables a reduction in the required classical perturbation without compromising the privacy budget, potentially improving model utility. However, the integration of classical and quantum noise for privacy preservation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a hybrid noise-added mechanism, HYPER-Q, that combines classical and quantum noise to protect the privacy of QML models. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its privacy guarantees and establish theoretical bounds on its utility. Empirically, we demonstrate that HYPER-Q outperforms existing classical noise-based mechanisms in terms of adversarial robustness across multiple real-world datasets."}

For this purpose, exact discrete versions of the path integral are constructed for three different orderings of the Hamiltonian: normal, anti-normal and symmetric (Weyl order). Subsequently, their different continuum versions are checked on the harmonic oscillator, to choose the symmetric ordering as a possibly correct choice for all Hamiltonians. Spotted mathematical subtleties in the simple case serve as a clue to the general solution. Finally, a general justification for the symmetric order is provided by deriving the continuum path integral starting from the exact discrete case by a renormalization procedure in the imaginary time frequency domain. While the role of Weyl order has already been found, the paper provides the missing proof of its suitability for every Hamiltonian and simplifies the previously established construction by referring only to creation and annihilation operators (without position and momentum operators)."}

Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a generic model and exploiting its exact solution, QR is found to cause a crossover of the scaling of the topological defect density with the time scale $τ$ of the quench, from Kibble-Zurek to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling as $τ$ increases. This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise."}

Here we reconstruct the relative phase of simulated Airy-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates in free space, a regime approached in microgravity, from interference fringes. The cubic phase dynamics are quantified via windowed polynomial fits with systematics-aware uncertainty estimates that account for window-induced correlations. We compare two experimentally feasible phase-extraction methods - heterodyne-based and density-based - and show that an Airy-Gaussian geometry yields substantially improved robustness to fit-window selection relative to an Airy-Airy collision. In the weakly interacting regime, the extracted cubic coefficient responds linearly to the effective one-dimensional interaction strength. Our approach turns cubic phase dynamics into a practical probe of weak mean-field nonlinearities in self-accelerating condensates."}

However, realizations have mostly been limited to classical applications or artificial setups. In this study, we focus on the quantum nature inherent in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems, which from the perspective of spectral theory corresponds to non-Hermiticity. Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems."}

We show that, in rotating binary condensates, quantized vortices in one component form hollow channels that act as self-induced weak links for the other, enabling superflow through otherwise impenetrable, phase-separated domains. This introduces a novel barrier mechanism: quantum pressure creates an effective barrier inside the vortex channel, set by the constriction width, which controls the superflow. Tuning the interspecies interaction strength drives a crossover from the hydrodynamic transport to Josephson tunneling regime. Long-range dipolar interactions further tune the weak-link properties, enabling both short links and two coupled junctions in series. Circuit models quantitatively capture the dc current-phase relations for both configurations. These results establish vortices as reconfigurable, interaction-controlled Josephson elements in superfluids."}

Here we show that this fragility leaves a clear experimental fingerprint in a one-dimensional quantum spin chain of as few as 14 Rydberg atoms. Weak integrability breaking from interatomic dipolar couplings is directly detectable within experimentally accessible times in the dynamics of non-local observables. In particular, magnetization fluctuations are highly sensitive to the breaking of fragile conservation laws and exhibit anomalous growth, which we observe experimentally; similar signatures appear in a semilocal string observable. Numerical simulations on substantially longer chains and a simplified classical stochastic model reproduce those features. We establish non-local observables as a sensitive probe of fragile conservation laws in quantum spin chains and Rydberg-atom arrays as a platform to test perturbative descriptions of quantum many-body dynamics with weak integrability breaking."}
