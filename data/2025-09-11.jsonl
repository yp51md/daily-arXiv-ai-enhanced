We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the\nnon-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases,\nelectron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential\nminimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening\nlifetimes by several orders of magnitude.

Quantum computers that interact with\nstandard computers to perform computations are called adaptive quantum\ncomputers. This work formalizes a model that describes these adaptive quantum\ncomputers. As quantum computers are still under development, this work focuses\non computations that terminate after a fixed number of steps, as that makes\ntheir implementation likely easier in practice.\n  First, we show that adaptive quantum computers are more powerful than\nstandard computers with respect to the practical problem of retrieving\ninformation from corrupted digital data. Standard computers struggle to\nretrieve such information within a fixed number of computation steps. The proof\nuses a structure-versus-randomness approach that splits the problem in a\nstructured and a random-like component. The potential of adaptive quantum\ncomputations follows from a specific example where information is retrieved\nfrom corrupted data. Additionally, adaptive quantum computers can even improve\nstandard computations for this problem that are not constrained by a fixed\nnumber of computation steps.\n  Next, we show how adaptive quantum computations can improve non-adaptive\nquantum computations when preparing specific quantum states. We present\nefficient adaptive quantum algorithms to prepare the uniform superposition\nstate, the GHZ state, the W-state and the Dicke state. These states are often\nused in other quantum algorithms, so having efficient routines for preparing\nthem also enhances the efficiency of other algorithms.
