While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities\ntoward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck.\nTraditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account\nfor crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to\nreduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use\nneural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity.

This method is highly\nparallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in\nneural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,\nadaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our\nreservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination\nfidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error\nreductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets,\nrespectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit\ndataset.

The first is the use\nof product formulas with the compressed double factorized form of the\nHamiltonian. The second is recognizing that for spectroscopy applications, it\nis sufficient to control the error in the eigenvalues of the (approximate)\nHamiltonian being implemented by the product formula, rather than the generic\nerror on the full time evolution operator. Using perturbation theory to\nestimate this eigenvalue error, we find that significantly fewer Trotter steps\nare needed than expected from the time evolution error bound. The third is the\nchoice of an optimized distribution of samples that takes advantage of the\nexponentially decaying Lorentzian kernel. Through constant factor resource\nestimates, we show that a challenging model Li$_4$Mn$_2$O cluster system with\n18 spatial orbitals and 22 electrons in the active space can be simulated with\n100 logical qubits and less than $4 \\times 10^8$ T gates per circuit. Finally,\nthe algorithm is implemented on a simulator, and the reconstructed spectrum is\nverified against a classical computational reference. The low cost of our\nalgorithm makes it attractive to use on fault-tolerant quantum devices to\naccelerate the development and commercialization of high-capacity battery\ncathodes."}

Recently, a version of quantum smoothing, in which Alice estimates\nthe state at time $t$ using her record on both sides of $t$, has been\ndeveloped. It requires Alice to make optimal inferences about the pre-$t$\nrecord of a second observer, say Bob, who recovers whatever information Alice\ndoes not. But for Alice to make this inference, she needs to know Bob's setup.\nIn this paper we consider what happens if Alice is mistaken in her assumption\nabout Bob's setup. We show that the accuracy -- as measured by the\nTrace-Squared-Deviation, of Alice's estimate of the true state (i.e., the state\nconditioned on her and Bob's pre-$t$ records) -- depends strongly on her setup,\nBob's actual setup, and the wrongly assumed setup.

We show that both the thermal partition function and the Loschmidt\namplitude can be understood as extensions of a single analytic function along\ndifferent paths in the complex plane. The zeros of Loschmidt amplitude encode\ndynamical features such as orthogonality, rate function singularities, and\nquantum speed limits, in analogy with the role of partition function zeros in\nequilibrium statistical mechanics. We further establish, through the\nCauchy-Riemann equations, that the high-temperature specific heat corresponds\nto early-time evolution. The discussion follows a pedagogical progression from\na single qubit to an interacting spin chain."}

Accurately describing its dynamics often\nrequires going beyond the weak system-environment coupling approximation.\nHowever, calculating the higher-order generators of such a dynamics, with a\nsystem-environment coupling that is not too weak, has been known to be\nchallenging, both numerically and analytically. This work presents the\nanalytical derivation of the complete fourth-order time-convolutionless (TCL)\ngenerator for a generic spin-boson model, accurate up to 4th order in the\nsystem-environment coupling parameter, under the assumption that the\nenvironmental spectral density is an odd function of frequency. In the case of\na semiconductor double-quantum-dot system, our results reveal corrections to\nthe dynamics that may become physically significant in some parameter regimes.\nFurthermore, we report that the widely used second-order TCL master equation\ntends to overestimate the non-Markovianity of a dynamics over a large parameter\nregime. Within the regime of its applicability, our results provide a\ncomputational advantage over numerically exact techniques. The accuracy of the\nfourth-order TCL generator is rigorously benchmarked against specialized\nanalytical calculations done for the Ohmic spectral density with Drude cutoff\nand against the numerically exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion technique."}

The framework starts with idealised specifications of\nfault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic\ntransformations.\n  To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction\nproperties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered\nfault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding\nfault on the other.
