After defining the winding number\nof the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we\nsystematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

We focus on the Wineland parameter $\\xi_W^2$ to measure spin\nsqueezing and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in\none-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, generating states with\nentanglement depths exceeding 6, and significantly outperforming conventional\nquench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse\nsequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional\noptimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in\nsystems containing $N=50$ spins.
