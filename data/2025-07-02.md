### [1] [Segmentation-Based Regression for Quantum Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00065)
*James C. Hateley*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对量子神经网络的分段回归方法，将实值输出编码为基数b的数字序列，通过贪婪逐位优化进行推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子硬件的进步需要将量子采样与经典推断结合的算法框架。

Method: 采用混合量子-经典架构，量子电路通过投影测量生成候选数字，经典前向模型基于任务特定误差函数评估候选。

Result: 在涉及PDE约束模型的逆问题上展示了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为量子输出与连续科学推断提供了稳健的高精度接口。

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum hardware motivate the development of algorithmic
frameworks that integrate quantum sampling with classical inference. This work
introduces a segmentation-based regression method tailored to quantum neural
networks (QNNs), where real-valued outputs are encoded as base-b digit
sequences and inferred through greedy digitwise optimization. By casting the
regression task as a constrained combinatorial problem over a structured digit
lattice, the method replaces continuous inference with interpretable and
tractable updates. A hybrid quantum-classical architecture is employed: quantum
circuits generate candidate digits through projective measurement, while
classical forward models evaluate these candidates based on task-specific error
functionals. We formalize the algorithm from first principles, derive
convergence and complexity bounds, and demonstrate its effectiveness on inverse
problems involving PDE-constrained models. The resulting framework provides a
robust, high-precision interface between quantum outputs and continuous
scientific inference.

Abstract: By using the quantum computing the properties of hypernuclei
${}^5_{\Lambda}$He, ${}^{\ 6}_{{\Lambda\Lambda}}$He and ${}^9_{\Lambda}$Be can
be investigated within microscopic cluster model. Our approach combines quantum
neural network (QNN) with iterative Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (IHHL) algorithm
(abbreviated as QNN-IHHL) to solve the quantum many-body problem. To
efficiently describe resonance phenomena, we employ complex scaling and
eigenvector continuation techniques, providing a robust framework for
identifying few-cluster resonance parameters within quantum computing. To
validate our quantum algorithm, the resonant $4^{+}$ state of
${}^9_{\Lambda}$Be is chosen as a core example. With QNN-IHHL algorithm we
realize a fully quantum workflow, which provides a novel framework and some
ground work for exploring resonance properties in complex nuclear many-body
systems.

discrete-variable scheme by Broadbent et al. (arXiv:1211.1080), but with more
freedom in choosing the number of traps. We provide a security proof, mostly
following the approach of Broadbent and Wainewright (arXiv:1607.03075). As a

### [4] [Observable and Unobservable in Quantum Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00098)

Result: 证明在信息传递链断裂条件下，可观测概率受可决定性约束，并遵循非交换代数，与量子力学基本假设形式等价。

Conclusion: 信息传递链的客观断裂导致逻辑独立性，其概率行为与量子力学一致，支持量子力学代数结构的理论基础。

Abstract: This work explores the connection between logical independence and the
algebraic structure of quantum mechanics. Building on results by Brukner et
al., it introduces the notion of \textit{onto-epistemic ignorance}: situations
in which the truth of a proposition is not deducible due to an objective
breakdown in the phenomenal chain that transmits information from a system A to
a system B, rather than to any subjective lack of knowledge. It is shown that,
under such conditions, the probabilities accessible to a real observer are
necessarily conditioned by decidability and obey a non-commutative algebra,
formally equivalent to the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for security analysis against the
Trojan-horse attacks (THA) launched to a practical fiber-based quantum key

utilize optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) for the spectral reflectance
analysis in the near-infrared range 1100 - 1800 nm with centimeter-level
resolution and with a noise floor down to -80 dB. Finally, the total
theoretical-security analysis against the THA side channel considering the
spectral reflectance and transmittance data over this spectral range is
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, our OTDR setup and the corresponding
results are the first of their kind in a wide spectral range.

Result: 平衡零差探测可达到量子Fisher信息极限，实现二次耦合强度的最优估计。

Conclusion: 平衡零差探测在非线性光机械系统中具有高精度测量的潜力，但热噪声会影响性能。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of an optomechanical system consisting of a single-mode
optical field coupled to a mechanical oscillator, where the nonlinear
interaction includes both linear and quadratic terms in the oscillator's
position. We present a full analytical solution to this quantum mechanical
Hamiltonian problem by employing the formalism of two-phonon coherent states.
Quantum estimation theory is applied to the resulting state of the optical
field, with a focus on evaluating the classical and quantum Fisher information
for estimating the strength of the quadratic coupling. Our estimation scheme
considers both standard and balanced homodyne photodetection, assuming an
initial optical state prepared as a superposition of vacuum and single-photon
states. We show that balanced homodyne detection can saturate the quantum
Fisher information, thus reaching the ultimate precision bound for estimating
the quadratic coupling. Additionally, we investigate the effect of thermal
noise on the quantum Fisher information in a realistic experimental context.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators permit unitary evolution interspersed
with locally resolved mid-circuit measurements. This paves the way for the
observation of large-scale space-time structures in quantum trajectories and
opens a window for the \emph{in situ} analysis of complex dynamical processes.
We demonstrate this idea using a paradigmatic dissipative spin model, which can
be implemented, e.g., on Rydberg quantum simulators. Here, already the
trajectories of individual experimental runs reveal surprisingly complex
statistical phenomena. In particular, we exploit free-energy functionals for
trajectory ensembles to identify dynamical features reminiscent of hydrophobic
behavior observed near the liquid-vapor transition in the presence of solutes
in water. We show that these phenomena are observable in experiments and
discuss the impact of common imperfections, such as readout errors and
disordered interactions.

Result: 成功生成自旋-1 GHZ态及其广义变体，并在扰动下表现出长寿命亚稳态。

Conclusion: 为非局域测量在量子态制备中的应用提供了新思路，适用于当前量子模拟器。

Abstract: Engineered dissipation offers a promising route to prepare correlated quantum
many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access using purely unitary
protocols. However, creating superpositions of multiple many-body eigenstates
with tunable properties remains a major challenge. We propose to periodically
interrupt the many-body evolution by precisely removing a given many-body Fock
state through a non-local post-selected measurement protocol. Upon tuning the
measurement period, we show that a dark state manifold survives the removal,
allowing us to filter the system and generate a coherent superposition within
this manifold at long times. As a testbed, we study a non-integrable spin-1 XY
chain featuring a solvable family of eigenstates that can differ
macroscopically in quasi-particle excitations. Our protocol generates tunable
superpositions of these eigenstates, including the spin-1
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a generalized variant with tunable
spatiotemporal order. Under perturbations, the system exhibits an exceptionally
long-lived metastable regime where the engineered superpositions remain robust.
Our work provides new insight into quantum state preparation via non-local
measurements using tools available in current quantum simulators.

### [9] [Fully Parallelized BP Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes Can Outperform BP-OSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00254)
*Ming Wang,Ang Li,Frank Mueller*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信念传播（BP）的轻量级解码器，结合了Chase解码的启发式后处理策略，通过并行解码降低延迟和复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在保持低逻辑错误率的同时，降低解码的延迟和复杂度。

Method: 利用BP振荡统计识别不可靠比特，生成修改后的测试模式，并通过低迭代BP并行解码。

Result: 在多种双变量自行车码上，逻辑错误率与BP-OSD相当或更好，且延迟更低。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了解码复杂度，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a lightweight decoder based solely on
belief-propagation (BP), augmented with a speculative post-processing strategy
inspired by classical Chase decoding. Our method identifies unreliable bits via
BP oscillation statistics, generates a set of modified test patterns, and
decodes them in parallel using low-iteration BP. We demonstrate that our
approach can achieve logical error rates comparable to or even better than
BP-OSD, but has lower latency over its parallelization for a variety of
bivariate bicycle codes, which significantly reduces decoding complexity.

Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the
robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important
case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls.
Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect
fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Bounds on the magnitude
of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based
simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the
control inputs

Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is highly susceptible to inertial acceleration
noises arising from the vibration of the experimental apparatus. There are
various methods for noise suppression. In this paper, we propose leveraging the
cross-correlation of multi-directional vibration noises to mitigate their
dephasing effect in matter-wave interferometers. Specifically, we analyse an
interferometer driven by its internal qubit under an external field and examine
the dephasing caused by a two-dimensional random inertial force. As we will
demonstrate, the coupling between the two-dimensional inertial force noise
components will shift the resonance peak but not change the shape of the power
spectral density. Moreover, when the noise approximately resonates with the
intrinsic frequency of the test mass, we find that the standard deviation of
the phase can be suppressed by a factor roughly equal to the Q-factor of the
noise. This technique holds significant potential for future gravity
experiments utilising quantum sensors, such as measuring gravitational
acceleration and exploring quantum entanglement induced by gravity.

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模控制门合成提供了更高效和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The synthesis of quantum operators involves decomposing general quantum gates
into the gate set supported by a given quantum device. Multi-controlled gates
are essential components in this process. In this work, we present improved
decompositions of multi-controlled NOT gates with logarithmic depth using a
single ancilla qubit, while also reducing the constant factors in the circuit
depth compared to previous work. We optimize a previously proposed
decomposition of multi-target, multi-controlled special unitary SU(2) gates by
identifying the presence of a conditionally clean qubit. Additionally, we
introduce the best-known decomposition of multi-controlled approximate unitary
U(2) gates without using ancilla qubits. This approach significantly reduces
the overall circuit depth and CNOT count while preserving an adjustable error
parameter, yielding a more efficient and scalable solution for synthesizing
large controlled-unitary gates. Our method is particularly suitable for both
NISQ and fault-tolerant quantum architectures. All software developed in this
project is freely available.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文通过计算复杂性理论证明，有限量子系统中判断是否热化或弛豫到特定稳态值是计算上不可行的，属于PSPACE完全问题。

Conclusion: 热化问题的不可解性源于多体物理的内在复杂性，而非无限系统的特殊性。

Abstract: Thermalization is the process through which a physical system evolves toward
a state of thermal equilibrium. Determining whether or not a physical system
will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed
matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables
in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using
tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a
Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes
or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for
a quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining
whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value
is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is
expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the
problem of determining whether the system thermalizes is contained in PSPACE
and is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. We also present
evidence that determining thermalization is PSPACE-hard under classical
polynomial time reductions and state a physically reasonable conjecture under
which it is PSPACE-complete. In light of recent results demonstrating
undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows
that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in
many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.

Abstract: Trapped-ion systems are one of the leading platforms for quantum information
processing, where a key challenge is to scale up system size while maintaining
high-fidelity two-qubit operations. A promising approach is to build
high-performance modules interconnected via strong coupling. In particular,
axial motional modes provide a feasible means of coupling short ion chains.
However, previous implementations of fully connected 5-ion modules based on
axial modes have been limited to fidelities of $96.6-98.0\%$. Here, we
demonstrate two-qubit quantum logic gates in a 5-ion $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ chain
using axial modes, achieving fidelities exceeding $99\%$ for adjacent pairs and
over $98\%$ for arbitrary pairs by carefully tackling dominant error sources.
Our results are beneficial to the development of scalable ion-trap quantum
processors, quantum simulation and quantum-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: The generation, controls, and storage of the gravitationally induced photon
echo using the 8.4 eV Thorium-229 nuclear clock transition on Earth are
theoretically investigated. With its exceptionally narrow linewidth of
approximately 1 mHz and high quality factor in the order of $10^{19}$, the
Thorium-229 clock transition allows for the potential detection of
gravitational-redshift effects at millimeter-scale altitude variations.
Moreover, the 1740-second half lifetime of the Thorium-229 isomeric state
allows for the slow movement of the system within its coherence time. Along
this line, we explore the generation, controls, and storage of photon echo
arising from a rotation induced inversion of the gravitational frequency shift
in a single target or in multiple equally spaced samples. Our approach lays the
foundation for the controllable gravitational quantum optics on Earth.

Abstract: We propose using quantum computers in conjunction with classical machine
learning to discover instances of interesting quantum many-body dynamics.
Concretely, an ``interest function'' is defined for a given circuit (family)
instance that can be evaluated on a quantum computer. The circuit is then
adapted by a classical learning agent to maximize interest. We illustrate this
approach using two examples and show numerically that, within a sufficiently
general circuit family, two simple interest functions based on (i)
classifiability of evolved states and (ii) spectral properties of the unitary
circuit, are maximized by discrete time crystals (DTCs) and dual-unitary
circuits, respectively. For (i), we also simulate the adaptive optimization and
show that it indeed finds DTCs with high probability. Our study suggests that
learning agents with access to quantum-computing resources can discover new
phenomena in many-body quantum dynamics, and establishes the design of good
interest functions as a future research paradigm for quantum many-body physics.

Abstract: The generation and dynamic control of the spatial mode of the dark-state
polarization using electromagnetically induced transparency are theoretically
investigated. We demonstrate that a combination of synthetic scalar and vector
potentials can be employed to engineer discrete spatial modes of the dark state
polariton, enabling quantum interference among these modes. We verify this
concept by showing the Rabi oscillation between two spatial modes and
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage among $\Lambda$-type three modes. Our
approach allows for the reallocation of stored photonic data from one location
to another, presenting potential applications such as photonic memory
optimization and retrieved light modulation.

Abstract: A positive economic effect from the implementation of quantum key
distribution (QKD) technology can be achieved only with significant scaling,
which involves the deployment of branched metropolitan area networks. The
creation of QKD systems suitable for such networks is an important task for the
coming years. This paper considers a method for preparing quantum states using
pulsed optical injection, which can be used as a basis for a compact
modulator-free transmitter ideally suited for QKD at typical distances within a
city. Considering the relative proximity between nodes of a MAN, we suggest to
abandon the decoy states, which, together with the proposed method of quantum
state preparation, allows making the transmitter extremely simple. We report
here the results of an experiment confirming the operating principle and
provide a security analysis of the three-state decoy-free QKD protocol that can
be implemented using such a device.

Abstract: The ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes exhibit a variety of
intriguing physical phenomena. In this work, we utilize the Hopfield model of a
two-mode bosonic system, with each mode interacts with a heat reservoir, to
research the behavior of quantum coherence. Our results indicate that a coupled
oscillator system can exhibit significant quantum coherence in the ultrastrong
and deep strong coupling regimes. In the ground state, the photon-mode and the
matter-mode coherences are equal. The larger coherences that encompass the
photon mode, the matter mode, and the overall system are achieved at lower
optical frequencies and with increased coupling strengths. Notably, the the
beam-splitter and phase rotation terms alone does not generate coherences for
either total coherence or subsystem coherences; instead, the generation of
quantum coherences originates from the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms.
When heat environments are present, the total coherence can be enhanced by the
the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms, while it has no effect on subsystem
coherences. Moreover, when the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms and the
the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms are considered together, the total
coherence increases with stronger coupling. We also observe that lower
frequencies maximize total coherence in the deep strong coupling regime. These
results demonstrate that the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes give
rise to novel characteristics of quantum coherence. This work provides valuable
insights into the quantum coherence properties, particularly in the ultrastrong
and deep strong coupling regimes between light and matter and may have
potential applications in quantum information processing.

Motivation: 随着量子技术的发展，传统密码协议面临威胁，PQC成为潜在解决方案，但其依赖高质量的随机数生成。研究旨在验证QRNG设备在PQC环境中的可行性和优势。

Method: 使用开源密码库和商用QRNG硬件，通过“熵即服务”（EaaS）模型，将QRNG集成到基于PQC的TLS通信网络中。实验包括虚拟化私有PKI网络和外部PQC服务器的连接。

Result: 实验表明，EaaS QRNG能实时监测熵质量，对TLS握手时间影响可忽略。

Conclusion: QRNG设备在PQC环境中具有实际应用潜力，能有效提升系统安全性。

Abstract: As quantum technologies advance, the security of popular cryptographic
protocols becomes more threatened by the capabilities of Cryptographically
Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs). In this scenario, Post-Quantum Cryptography
(PQC) has become a potential solution to prolong the life of existing Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems. However, PQC protocols depend on high-quality
randomness for key generation and encapsulation procedures, with the quality of
the entropy source potentially having a profound impact on the security of the
overall system. In this work, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept enabling the
incorporation of Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) devices within
communication networks using PQC-based Transport Layer Security (TLS).Using
open-source cryptographic libraries and commercial QRNG hardware, we
demonstrate their use as entropy sources via an Entropy-as-a-Service (EaaS)
model. We highlight two particular use cases: a fully virtualized private PKI
network and a connection to an external PQC-enabled server. Experimental
results show that EaaS QRNG enables real-time entropy monitoring and quality
assessment in cryptographic management systems, with negligible impact on TLS
handshake time.

Abstract: Wave-particle duality is known to be equivalent to an entropic uncertainty
relation based on the min- and max-entropies, which have a clear operational
meaning in quantum cryptography. Here, we derive a connection between
wave-particle relations and the semi-device-independent (SDI) security
framework. In particular, we express an SDI witness entirely in terms of two
complementary interferometric quantities: visibility and input
distinguishability. Applying a symmetry condition to the interferometric
quantities, we identify a scenario in which the classical bound is violated and
the security condition is met in wave-particle experiments with a tunable beam
splitter. This enables the certification of non-classicality and the positivity
of the key rate directly from complementary interferometric quantities.
Moreover, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment using
orbital-angular-momentum encoded quantum states of light in a tunable
interferometer, validating our theoretical predictions. Finally, we analyze an
improved bound on the SDI security condition, effectively enlarging the
parameter region where secure communication can be certified.

Abstract: A particularly useful tool for characterizing multi-qubit systems is the
correlation tensor, providing an experimentally friendly and theoretically
concise representation of quantum states. In this work, we analyze the
evolution of the correlation tensor elements of quantum systems composed of
$\frac12$-spins, generated by mutual interactions and the influence of the
external field. We focus on two-body interactions in the form of anisotropic
Heisenberg as well as antisymmetric exchange interaction models. The evolution
of the system is visualized in the form of a trajectory in a suitable
correlation space, which, depending on the system's frequencies, exhibits
periodic or nonperiodic behavior. In the case of two $\frac12$-spins we study
the stationary correlations for several classes of Hamiltonians, which allows a
full characterization of the families of density matrices invariant under the
evolution generated by the Hamiltonians. We discuss some common properties
shared by the 2- and 3-qubit systems and show how a strong external field can
play a stabilizing factor with respect to certain correlation characteristics.

Abstract: Quantum computing provides computational advantages in various domains. To

Abstract: Information engines harness measurement and feedback to convert energy into
useful work. In this study, we investigate the fundamental trade-offs between
ergotropic output power, thermodynamic efficiency and information-to-work
conversion efficiency in such engines, explicitly accounting for the finite
time required for measurement. As a model engine, we consider a two-level
quantum system from which work is extracted via a temporarily coupled quantum
harmonic oscillator that serves as the measurement device. This quantum device
is subsequently read out by a classical apparatus. We compute trade-offs for
the performance of the information engine using Pareto optimisation, which has
recently been successfully used to optimise performance in engineering and
biological physics. Our results offer design principles for future experimental
implementations of information engines, such as in nano-mechanical systems and
circuit QED platforms.

Conclusion: 该框架成功将经典动态编程算法量子化，并在特定条件下显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce a quantum dynamic programming framework that allows us to
directly extend to the quantum realm a large body of classical dynamic
programming algorithms. The corresponding quantum dynamic programming
algorithms retain the same space complexity as their classical counterpart,
while achieving a computational speedup. For a combinatorial (search or
optimization) problem $\mathcal P$ and an instance $I$ of $\mathcal P$, such a
speedup can be expressed in terms of the average degree $\delta$ of the
dependency digraph $G_{\mathcal{P}}(I)$ of $I$, determined by a recursive
formulation of $\mathcal P$. The nodes of this graph are the subproblems of
$\mathcal P$ induced by $I$ and its arcs are directed from each subproblem to
those on whose solution it relies. In particular, our framework allows us to
solve the considered problems in $\tilde{O}(|V(G_{\mathcal{P}}(I))|
\sqrt{\delta})$ time. As an example, we obtain a quantum version of the
Bellman-Ford algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single source vertex
to all the other vertices in a weighted $n$-vertex digraph with $m$ edges that
runs in $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{nm})$ time, which improves the best known classical
upper bound when $m \in \Omega(n^{1.4})$.

Conclusion: 该算法在早期容错量子计算中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution is fundamental to analyzing quantum many-body
systems, yet classical simulation requires exponentially growing resources in
both system size and evolution time. While quantum approaches reduce the
system-size scaling, existing methods rely on heuristic techniques with
measurement precision or success probability that deteriorates as evolution
time increases. We present a quantum algorithm that prepares normalized
imaginary-time evolved states using an adaptive normalization factor to
maintain stable success probability over large imaginary times. Our algorithm
approximates the target state to polynomially small errors in inverse imaginary
time using polynomially many elementary quantum gates and a single ancilla
qubit, achieving success probability close to one. When the initial state has
reasonable overlap with the ground state, this algorithm also achieves
polynomial resource complexity in the system size. We extend this approach to
ground-state preparation and ground-state energy estimation, achieving reduced
circuit depth compared to existing methods. Numerical experiments validate our
theoretical results for evolution time up to 50, demonstrating the algorithm's
effectiveness for long-time evolution and its potential applications for early
fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Conclusion: 结果表明激子-声子相互作用可能是实验中极化子在无序介质中减速的主要原因。

Abstract: Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet
recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this
work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic
disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled
microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation
propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy
and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using
parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that
exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons,
particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective
light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of
these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak
resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon
interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton
slowdown in disordered media.

Abstract: A many-body quantum system which consists of collective quantum states, such

light-matter interaction. In this work, we experimentally study one-dimensional
superatoms in waveguide quantum electrodynamics with a periodic array of
superconducting artificial atoms. We engineer the periodic atomic array with
two distinct nearest-neighbor spacings, i.e., $d$=$\lambda_0/2$ and
$d$=$\lambda_0/4$, which correspond to Bragg and anti-Bragg scattering
conditions, respectively. The system consists of eight atoms arranged to
maintain these specific interatomic distances. By controlling atomic
frequencies, we modify Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, resulting in distinctly
different quantum optical phenomena, such as collectively induced transparency
and a broad photonic bandgap. Moreover, due to strong waveguide-atom couplings
in superconducting quantum circuits, efficient light manipulations are realized
in small-size systems. Our work demonstrates tunable optical properties of
Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, as well as their potential applications in

Abstract: This work studies how a suitably-designed classical system generates with a
quantum-like (QL) state space mediated by a graph. The graph plays a special
dual role by directing the topology of the classical network and defining a
state space that comprises superpositions of states in a tensor product basis.
The basis for constructing QL graphs and their properties is reviewed and
extended. An optimization of the graph product is developed to produce a more
compact graph with the essential properties required to produce states that
mimic many of the properties of quantum states. This provides a concrete
visualization of the correlation structure in a quantum state space. The
question of whether and, if so, how, entanglement can be exhibited by these QL
systems is discussed critically and contrasted to the concept of `classical
entanglement' in optics.

Abstract: Quantum networks enhance quantum communication schemes and link multiple
users over large areas. Harnessing high dimensional quantum states - i.e.
qu-d-its - allows for a denser transfer of information with increased
robustness to noise compared to qubits. Frequency encoding enables access to
such qu-d-its at telecom wavelengths, while manipulating quantum information
with off-the-shelf fibered devices.
  We use a low free spectral range silicon microresonator to generate Bell
states of dimension d=2 (qubits) and d=3 (qutrits) via spontaneous four wave
mixing, to implement and optimize a multi-dimensional frequency-bin
entanglement-based quantum key distribution network.
  We tune the source (via pump power), the signal processing (via coincidence
window size) and qu-d-it encoding (d=2 or 3) using a single fibered hardware
based on Fourier-transform pulse shaping and electro-optic modulation depending
on interconnection lengths. We achieve secure key rates of 1374 bit/s with
qutrits, and estimate the communication range to 295 km with qubits. We access
up to 80 frequency modes, resulting in 21 quantum channels, that provide stable
communication over more than 21 hours. We demonstrate a competitive
communication range in a multi-dimensional entanglement-based quantum key
distribution network that lays the groundwork for larger dimensionality
implementations deployed on metropolitan fiber links.

Abstract: The recently introduced quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM)
protocol aims to test the quantum nature of gravity by witnessing the
entanglement produced by the virtual exchange of a graviton between two
spatially superposed masses. Shortly after the original proposal, further
improvements upon the experiment were suggested, including the addition of a
third mass, showing that three-qubit setups can be more resilient to higher
rates of decoherence caused by the interaction of the system with the
environment. In this work, we investigate the type of tripartite entanglement
generated in these three-qubit QGEM experiments when considering the effects of
decoherence. We show that the gravitational interaction between the qubits is
able to generate genuine tripartite entanglement between them, studying the
corresponding parameter spaces and comparing the performance of the possible
experimental configurations of the three qubits at allowing for the detection
of genuine entanglement via an entanglement witness.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum hardware motivate the development of algorithmic
frameworks that integrate quantum sampling with classical inference. This work
introduces a segmentation-based regression method tailored to quantum neural
networks (QNNs), where real-valued outputs are encoded as base-b digit
sequences and inferred through greedy digitwise optimization. By casting the
regression task as a constrained combinatorial problem over a structured digit
lattice, the method replaces continuous inference with interpretable and
tractable updates. A hybrid quantum-classical architecture is employed: quantum
circuits generate candidate digits through projective measurement, while
classical forward models evaluate these candidates based on task-specific error
functionals. We formalize the algorithm from first principles, derive
convergence and complexity bounds, and demonstrate its effectiveness on inverse
problems involving PDE-constrained models. The resulting framework provides a
robust, high-precision interface between quantum outputs and continuous
scientific inference.

Abstract: By using the quantum computing the properties of hypernuclei
${}^5_{\Lambda}$He, ${}^{\ 6}_{{\Lambda\Lambda}}$He and ${}^9_{\Lambda}$Be can
be investigated within microscopic cluster model. Our approach combines quantum
neural network (QNN) with iterative Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (IHHL) algorithm
(abbreviated as QNN-IHHL) to solve the quantum many-body problem. To
efficiently describe resonance phenomena, we employ complex scaling and
eigenvector continuation techniques, providing a robust framework for
identifying few-cluster resonance parameters within quantum computing. To
validate our quantum algorithm, the resonant $4^{+}$ state of
${}^9_{\Lambda}$Be is chosen as a core example. With QNN-IHHL algorithm we
realize a fully quantum workflow, which provides a novel framework and some
ground work for exploring resonance properties in complex nuclear many-body

Abstract: This work explores the connection between logical independence and the
algebraic structure of quantum mechanics. Building on results by Brukner et
al., it introduces the notion of \textit{onto-epistemic ignorance}: situations
in which the truth of a proposition is not deducible due to an objective
breakdown in the phenomenal chain that transmits information from a system A to
a system B, rather than to any subjective lack of knowledge. It is shown that,
under such conditions, the probabilities accessible to a real observer are
necessarily conditioned by decidability and obey a non-commutative algebra,
formally equivalent to the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics.

theoretical-security analysis against the THA side channel considering the
spectral reflectance and transmittance data over this spectral range is
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, our OTDR setup and the corresponding
results are the first of their kind in a wide spectral range.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of an optomechanical system consisting of a single-mode
optical field coupled to a mechanical oscillator, where the nonlinear
interaction includes both linear and quadratic terms in the oscillator's
position. We present a full analytical solution to this quantum mechanical
Hamiltonian problem by employing the formalism of two-phonon coherent states.
Quantum estimation theory is applied to the resulting state of the optical
field, with a focus on evaluating the classical and quantum Fisher information
for estimating the strength of the quadratic coupling. Our estimation scheme
considers both standard and balanced homodyne photodetection, assuming an
initial optical state prepared as a superposition of vacuum and single-photon
states. We show that balanced homodyne detection can saturate the quantum
Fisher information, thus reaching the ultimate precision bound for estimating
the quadratic coupling. Additionally, we investigate the effect of thermal
noise on the quantum Fisher information in a realistic experimental context.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators permit unitary evolution interspersed
with locally resolved mid-circuit measurements. This paves the way for the
observation of large-scale space-time structures in quantum trajectories and
opens a window for the \emph{in situ} analysis of complex dynamical processes.
We demonstrate this idea using a paradigmatic dissipative spin model, which can
be implemented, e.g., on Rydberg quantum simulators. Here, already the
trajectories of individual experimental runs reveal surprisingly complex
statistical phenomena. In particular, we exploit free-energy functionals for
trajectory ensembles to identify dynamical features reminiscent of hydrophobic
behavior observed near the liquid-vapor transition in the presence of solutes
in water. We show that these phenomena are observable in experiments and
discuss the impact of common imperfections, such as readout errors and
disordered interactions.

Abstract: Engineered dissipation offers a promising route to prepare correlated quantum
many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access using purely unitary
protocols. However, creating superpositions of multiple many-body eigenstates
with tunable properties remains a major challenge. We propose to periodically
interrupt the many-body evolution by precisely removing a given many-body Fock
state through a non-local post-selected measurement protocol. Upon tuning the
measurement period, we show that a dark state manifold survives the removal,
allowing us to filter the system and generate a coherent superposition within
this manifold at long times. As a testbed, we study a non-integrable spin-1 XY
chain featuring a solvable family of eigenstates that can differ
macroscopically in quasi-particle excitations. Our protocol generates tunable
superpositions of these eigenstates, including the spin-1
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a generalized variant with tunable
spatiotemporal order. Under perturbations, the system exhibits an exceptionally
long-lived metastable regime where the engineered superpositions remain robust.
Our work provides new insight into quantum state preparation via non-local
measurements using tools available in current quantum simulators.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a lightweight decoder based solely on
belief-propagation (BP), augmented with a speculative post-processing strategy
inspired by classical Chase decoding. Our method identifies unreliable bits via
BP oscillation statistics, generates a set of modified test patterns, and
decodes them in parallel using low-iteration BP. We demonstrate that our
approach can achieve logical error rates comparable to or even better than
BP-OSD, but has lower latency over its parallelization for a variety of
bivariate bicycle codes, which significantly reduces decoding complexity.

Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect

simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the
control inputs

Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is highly susceptible to inertial acceleration
noises arising from the vibration of the experimental apparatus. There are
various methods for noise suppression. In this paper, we propose leveraging the
cross-correlation of multi-directional vibration noises to mitigate their
dephasing effect in matter-wave interferometers. Specifically, we analyse an
interferometer driven by its internal qubit under an external field and examine
the dephasing caused by a two-dimensional random inertial force. As we will
demonstrate, the coupling between the two-dimensional inertial force noise
components will shift the resonance peak but not change the shape of the power
spectral density. Moreover, when the noise approximately resonates with the
intrinsic frequency of the test mass, we find that the standard deviation of
the phase can be suppressed by a factor roughly equal to the Q-factor of the
noise. This technique holds significant potential for future gravity
experiments utilising quantum sensors, such as measuring gravitational
acceleration and exploring quantum entanglement induced by gravity.

Abstract: The synthesis of quantum operators involves decomposing general quantum gates
into the gate set supported by a given quantum device. Multi-controlled gates
are essential components in this process. In this work, we present improved
decompositions of multi-controlled NOT gates with logarithmic depth using a
single ancilla qubit, while also reducing the constant factors in the circuit
depth compared to previous work. We optimize a previously proposed
decomposition of multi-target, multi-controlled special unitary SU(2) gates by
identifying the presence of a conditionally clean qubit. Additionally, we
introduce the best-known decomposition of multi-controlled approximate unitary
U(2) gates without using ancilla qubits. This approach significantly reduces
the overall circuit depth and CNOT count while preserving an adjustable error
parameter, yielding a more efficient and scalable solution for synthesizing
large controlled-unitary gates. Our method is particularly suitable for both
NISQ and fault-tolerant quantum architectures. All software developed in this
project is freely available.

Abstract: Thermalization is the process through which a physical system evolves toward
a state of thermal equilibrium. Determining whether or not a physical system
will thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed
matter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables
in these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using
tools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a
Hamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes
or relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for
a quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining
whether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value
is PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is
expected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the
problem of determining whether the system thermalizes is contained in PSPACE
and is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. We also present
evidence that determining thermalization is PSPACE-hard under classical
polynomial time reductions and state a physically reasonable conjecture under
which it is PSPACE-complete. In light of recent results demonstrating
undecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows
that the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in
many-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems.

Abstract: Trapped-ion systems are one of the leading platforms for quantum information
processing, where a key challenge is to scale up system size while maintaining
high-fidelity two-qubit operations. A promising approach is to build
high-performance modules interconnected via strong coupling. In particular,
axial motional modes provide a feasible means of coupling short ion chains.
However, previous implementations of fully connected 5-ion modules based on
axial modes have been limited to fidelities of $96.6-98.0\%$. Here, we
demonstrate two-qubit quantum logic gates in a 5-ion $^{40}$Ca$^{+}$ chain
using axial modes, achieving fidelities exceeding $99\%$ for adjacent pairs and
over $98\%$ for arbitrary pairs by carefully tackling dominant error sources.
Our results are beneficial to the development of scalable ion-trap quantum
processors, quantum simulation and quantum-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: The generation, controls, and storage of the gravitationally induced photon
echo using the 8.4 eV Thorium-229 nuclear clock transition on Earth are
theoretically investigated. With its exceptionally narrow linewidth of
approximately 1 mHz and high quality factor in the order of $10^{19}$, the
Thorium-229 clock transition allows for the potential detection of
gravitational-redshift effects at millimeter-scale altitude variations.
Moreover, the 1740-second half lifetime of the Thorium-229 isomeric state
allows for the slow movement of the system within its coherence time. Along
this line, we explore the generation, controls, and storage of photon echo
arising from a rotation induced inversion of the gravitational frequency shift
in a single target or in multiple equally spaced samples. Our approach lays the

Abstract: We propose using quantum computers in conjunction with classical machine
learning to discover instances of interesting quantum many-body dynamics.
Concretely, an ``interest function'' is defined for a given circuit (family)
instance that can be evaluated on a quantum computer. The circuit is then
adapted by a classical learning agent to maximize interest. We illustrate this
approach using two examples and show numerically that, within a sufficiently
general circuit family, two simple interest functions based on (i)
classifiability of evolved states and (ii) spectral properties of the unitary
circuit, are maximized by discrete time crystals (DTCs) and dual-unitary
circuits, respectively. For (i), we also simulate the adaptive optimization and
show that it indeed finds DTCs with high probability. Our study suggests that
learning agents with access to quantum-computing resources can discover new
phenomena in many-body quantum dynamics, and establishes the design of good
interest functions as a future research paradigm for quantum many-body physics.

Abstract: A positive economic effect from the implementation of quantum key

which involves the deployment of branched metropolitan area networks. The
creation of QKD systems suitable for such networks is an important task for the

abandon the decoy states, which, together with the proposed method of quantum

Abstract: The ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes exhibit a variety of
intriguing physical phenomena. In this work, we utilize the Hopfield model of a
two-mode bosonic system, with each mode interacts with a heat reservoir, to
research the behavior of quantum coherence. Our results indicate that a coupled
oscillator system can exhibit significant quantum coherence in the ultrastrong
and deep strong coupling regimes. In the ground state, the photon-mode and the
matter-mode coherences are equal. The larger coherences that encompass the
photon mode, the matter mode, and the overall system are achieved at lower
optical frequencies and with increased coupling strengths. Notably, the the
beam-splitter and phase rotation terms alone does not generate coherences for
either total coherence or subsystem coherences; instead, the generation of
quantum coherences originates from the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms.
When heat environments are present, the total coherence can be enhanced by the
the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms, while it has no effect on subsystem
coherences. Moreover, when the one-mode and two-mode squeezing terms and the
the beam-splitter and phase rotation terms are considered together, the total
coherence increases with stronger coupling. We also observe that lower
frequencies maximize total coherence in the deep strong coupling regime. These
results demonstrate that the ultrastrong and deep strong coupling regimes give
rise to novel characteristics of quantum coherence. This work provides valuable
insights into the quantum coherence properties, particularly in the ultrastrong
and deep strong coupling regimes between light and matter and may have
potential applications in quantum information processing.

Result: 实验表明，EaaS QRNG能实时监控熵质量，且对TLS握手时间影响可忽略。

Conclusion: QRNG在PQC-TLS中的应用可行且高效，为后量子时代的密码安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: As quantum technologies advance, the security of popular cryptographic
protocols becomes more threatened by the capabilities of Cryptographically
Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs). In this scenario, Post-Quantum Cryptography
(PQC) has become a potential solution to prolong the life of existing Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems. However, PQC protocols depend on high-quality
randomness for key generation and encapsulation procedures, with the quality of
the entropy source potentially having a profound impact on the security of the
overall system. In this work, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept enabling the
incorporation of Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) devices within
communication networks using PQC-based Transport Layer Security (TLS).Using
open-source cryptographic libraries and commercial QRNG hardware, we
demonstrate their use as entropy sources via an Entropy-as-a-Service (EaaS)
model. We highlight two particular use cases: a fully virtualized private PKI
network and a connection to an external PQC-enabled server. Experimental
results show that EaaS QRNG enables real-time entropy monitoring and quality
assessment in cryptographic management systems, with negligible impact on TLS
handshake time.

Abstract: Wave-particle duality is known to be equivalent to an entropic uncertainty
relation based on the min- and max-entropies, which have a clear operational
meaning in quantum cryptography. Here, we derive a connection between
wave-particle relations and the semi-device-independent (SDI) security
framework. In particular, we express an SDI witness entirely in terms of two
complementary interferometric quantities: visibility and input
distinguishability. Applying a symmetry condition to the interferometric
quantities, we identify a scenario in which the classical bound is violated and
the security condition is met in wave-particle experiments with a tunable beam
splitter. This enables the certification of non-classicality and the positivity
of the key rate directly from complementary interferometric quantities.
Moreover, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment using
orbital-angular-momentum encoded quantum states of light in a tunable
interferometer, validating our theoretical predictions. Finally, we analyze an
improved bound on the SDI security condition, effectively enlarging the
parameter region where secure communication can be certified.

Abstract: A particularly useful tool for characterizing multi-qubit systems is the
correlation tensor, providing an experimentally friendly and theoretically
concise representation of quantum states. In this work, we analyze the
evolution of the correlation tensor elements of quantum systems composed of
$\frac12$-spins, generated by mutual interactions and the influence of the
external field. We focus on two-body interactions in the form of anisotropic
Heisenberg as well as antisymmetric exchange interaction models. The evolution
of the system is visualized in the form of a trajectory in a suitable
correlation space, which, depending on the system's frequencies, exhibits
periodic or nonperiodic behavior. In the case of two $\frac12$-spins we study
the stationary correlations for several classes of Hamiltonians, which allows a
full characterization of the families of density matrices invariant under the
evolution generated by the Hamiltonians. We discuss some common properties
shared by the 2- and 3-qubit systems and show how a strong external field can
play a stabilizing factor with respect to certain correlation characteristics.

Abstract: Quantum computing provides computational advantages in various domains. To

Abstract: Information engines harness measurement and feedback to convert energy into

quantum system from which work is extracted via a temporarily coupled quantum
harmonic oscillator that serves as the measurement device. This quantum device
is subsequently read out by a classical apparatus. We compute trade-offs for
the performance of the information engine using Pareto optimisation, which has
recently been successfully used to optimise performance in engineering and
biological physics. Our results offer design principles for future experimental

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a quantum dynamic programming framework that allows us to
directly extend to the quantum realm a large body of classical dynamic
programming algorithms. The corresponding quantum dynamic programming
algorithms retain the same space complexity as their classical counterpart,
while achieving a computational speedup. For a combinatorial (search or
optimization) problem $\mathcal P$ and an instance $I$ of $\mathcal P$, such a
speedup can be expressed in terms of the average degree $\delta$ of the
dependency digraph $G_{\mathcal{P}}(I)$ of $I$, determined by a recursive
formulation of $\mathcal P$. The nodes of this graph are the subproblems of
$\mathcal P$ induced by $I$ and its arcs are directed from each subproblem to
those on whose solution it relies. In particular, our framework allows us to
solve the considered problems in $\tilde{O}(|V(G_{\mathcal{P}}(I))|
\sqrt{\delta})$ time. As an example, we obtain a quantum version of the
Bellman-Ford algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single source vertex
to all the other vertices in a weighted $n$-vertex digraph with $m$ edges that
runs in $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{nm})$ time, which improves the best known classical
upper bound when $m \in \Omega(n^{1.4})$.

Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution is fundamental to analyzing quantum many-body
systems, yet classical simulation requires exponentially growing resources in
both system size and evolution time. While quantum approaches reduce the
system-size scaling, existing methods rely on heuristic techniques with
measurement precision or success probability that deteriorates as evolution
time increases. We present a quantum algorithm that prepares normalized
imaginary-time evolved states using an adaptive normalization factor to
maintain stable success probability over large imaginary times. Our algorithm
approximates the target state to polynomially small errors in inverse imaginary
time using polynomially many elementary quantum gates and a single ancilla
qubit, achieving success probability close to one. When the initial state has
reasonable overlap with the ground state, this algorithm also achieves
polynomial resource complexity in the system size. We extend this approach to
ground-state preparation and ground-state energy estimation, achieving reduced
circuit depth compared to existing methods. Numerical experiments validate our
theoretical results for evolution time up to 50, demonstrating the algorithm's
effectiveness for long-time evolution and its potential applications for early
fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Motivation: 实验发现分子激子-极化子的传播速度远低于预期，需要理论解释静态能量无序如何影响极化子群速度。

Method: 采用非微扰方法，无需精确对角化或主方程传播，仅依赖可测量参数（平均激子能量、方差、微腔色散和拉比分裂）进行计算。

Result: 激子非均匀展宽显著减缓了上下极化子的速度，特别是当平均激子能量波动接近集体光-物质耦合强度时。

Conclusion: 激子-声子相互作用可能是实验中观察到的极化子速度减慢的主要原因。

Abstract: Molecular exciton-polaritons exhibit long-range, ultrafast propagation, yet
recent experiments have reported far slower propagation than expected. In this
work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic
disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled
microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation
propagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy
and its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using
parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that
exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons,
particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective
light-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of
these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak
resonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon
interactions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton
slowdown in disordered media.

Abstract: A many-body quantum system which consists of collective quantum states, such
as superradiant and subradiant states, behaves as a multi-level superatom in
light-matter interaction. In this work, we experimentally study one-dimensional
superatoms in waveguide quantum electrodynamics with a periodic array of
superconducting artificial atoms. We engineer the periodic atomic array with
two distinct nearest-neighbor spacings, i.e., $d$=$\lambda_0/2$ and
$d$=$\lambda_0/4$, which correspond to Bragg and anti-Bragg scattering
conditions, respectively. The system consists of eight atoms arranged to
maintain these specific interatomic distances. By controlling atomic
frequencies, we modify Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, resulting in distinctly
different quantum optical phenomena, such as collectively induced transparency
and a broad photonic bandgap. Moreover, due to strong waveguide-atom couplings
in superconducting quantum circuits, efficient light manipulations are realized
in small-size systems. Our work demonstrates tunable optical properties of
Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, as well as their potential applications in
quantum devices.

Abstract: This work studies how a suitably-designed classical system generates with a
quantum-like (QL) state space mediated by a graph. The graph plays a special
dual role by directing the topology of the classical network and defining a
state space that comprises superpositions of states in a tensor product basis.
The basis for constructing QL graphs and their properties is reviewed and
extended. An optimization of the graph product is developed to produce a more
compact graph with the essential properties required to produce states that
mimic many of the properties of quantum states. This provides a concrete
visualization of the correlation structure in a quantum state space. The
question of whether and, if so, how, entanglement can be exhibited by these QL
systems is discussed critically and contrasted to the concept of `classical
entanglement' in optics.

Abstract: Quantum networks enhance quantum communication schemes and link multiple
users over large areas. Harnessing high dimensional quantum states - i.e.
qu-d-its - allows for a denser transfer of information with increased
robustness to noise compared to qubits. Frequency encoding enables access to
such qu-d-its at telecom wavelengths, while manipulating quantum information
with off-the-shelf fibered devices.
  We use a low free spectral range silicon microresonator to generate Bell
states of dimension d=2 (qubits) and d=3 (qutrits) via spontaneous four wave
mixing, to implement and optimize a multi-dimensional frequency-bin
entanglement-based quantum key distribution network.
  We tune the source (via pump power), the signal processing (via coincidence
window size) and qu-d-it encoding (d=2 or 3) using a single fibered hardware
based on Fourier-transform pulse shaping and electro-optic modulation depending
on interconnection lengths. We achieve secure key rates of 1374 bit/s with
qutrits, and estimate the communication range to 295 km with qubits. We access
up to 80 frequency modes, resulting in 21 quantum channels, that provide stable
communication over more than 21 hours. We demonstrate a competitive

distribution network that lays the groundwork for larger dimensionality
implementations deployed on metropolitan fiber links.

Abstract: The recently introduced quantum gravity-induced entanglement of masses (QGEM)
protocol aims to test the quantum nature of gravity by witnessing the
entanglement produced by the virtual exchange of a graviton between two
spatially superposed masses. Shortly after the original proposal, further
improvements upon the experiment were suggested, including the addition of a
third mass, showing that three-qubit setups can be more resilient to higher
rates of decoherence caused by the interaction of the system with the
environment. In this work, we investigate the type of tripartite entanglement
generated in these three-qubit QGEM experiments when considering the effects of
decoherence. We show that the gravitational interaction between the qubits is
able to generate genuine tripartite entanglement between them, studying the
corresponding parameter spaces and comparing the performance of the possible
experimental configurations of the three qubits at allowing for the detection
of genuine entanglement via an entanglement witness.

Abstract: Temperature chaos is a striking phenomenon in spin glasses, where even slight
changes in temperature lead to a complete reconfiguration of the spin state.
Another intriguing effect is the reentrant transition, in which lowering the
temperature drives the system from a ferromagnetic phase into a less ordered
spin-glass or paramagnetic phase. In the present paper, we reveal an unexpected
connection between these seemingly unrelated phenomena in the
finite-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses by introducing a
generalized formulation that incorporates correlations among disorder
variables. Assuming the existence of a spin glass phase at finite temperature,
we establish that temperature chaos arises as a logical consequence of
reentrance in the Edwards-Anderson model. Our findings uncover a previously
hidden mathematical structure relating reentrance and temperature chaos,
offering a new perspective on the physics of spin glasses beyond the mean-field
theory.

Conclusion: GNEP在保持高预测准确性和可迁移性的同时，显著提高了计算效率，适合大规模分子动力学模拟。

Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) such as neuroevolution
potentials (NEP) combine quantum-mechanical accuracy with computational
efficiency significantly accelerate atomistic dynamic simulations. Trained by
derivative-free optimization, the normal NEP achieves good accuracy, but
suffers from inefficiency due to the high-dimensional parameter search. To
overcome this problem, we present a gradient-optimized NEP (GNEP) training
framework employing explicit analytical gradients and the Adam optimizer. This
approach greatly improves training efficiency and convergence speedily while
maintaining accuracy and physical interpretability. By applying GNEP to the
training of Sb-Te material systems(datasets include crystalline, liquid, and
disordered phases), the fitting time has been substantially reduced-often by
orders of magnitude-compared to the NEP training framework. The fitted
potentials are validated by DFT reference calculations, demonstrating
satisfactory agreement in equation of state and radial distribution functions.
These results confirm that GNEP retains high predictive accuracy and
transferability while considerably improved computational efficiency, making it
well-suited for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple
input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance
on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is
trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves
as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical
account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the
presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop
such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of
hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from
statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical
performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk
minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In
doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons
specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to
the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the
generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification
tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or
full-batch gradient descent.

Conclusion: 研究为自旋玻璃物理提供了新见解，揭示了重入与温度混沌的隐藏联系。

Abstract: Temperature chaos is a striking phenomenon in spin glasses, where even slight
changes in temperature lead to a complete reconfiguration of the spin state.
Another intriguing effect is the reentrant transition, in which lowering the
temperature drives the system from a ferromagnetic phase into a less ordered
spin-glass or paramagnetic phase. In the present paper, we reveal an unexpected
connection between these seemingly unrelated phenomena in the
finite-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses by introducing a
generalized formulation that incorporates correlations among disorder
variables. Assuming the existence of a spin glass phase at finite temperature,
we establish that temperature chaos arises as a logical consequence of
reentrance in the Edwards-Anderson model. Our findings uncover a previously
hidden mathematical structure relating reentrance and temperature chaos,
offering a new perspective on the physics of spin glasses beyond the mean-field
theory.

Motivation: 解决传统神经进化势（NEP）在高维参数搜索中的低效问题。

Method: 采用显式解析梯度和Adam优化器进行梯度优化训练。

Result: 在Sb-Te材料系统中，训练时间大幅减少，拟合势能验证显示与DFT计算结果一致。

Conclusion: GNEP在保持高预测准确性和可迁移性的同时，显著提高了计算效率，适用于大规模分子动力学模拟。

Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) such as neuroevolution
potentials (NEP) combine quantum-mechanical accuracy with computational
efficiency significantly accelerate atomistic dynamic simulations. Trained by
derivative-free optimization, the normal NEP achieves good accuracy, but
suffers from inefficiency due to the high-dimensional parameter search. To
overcome this problem, we present a gradient-optimized NEP (GNEP) training
framework employing explicit analytical gradients and the Adam optimizer. This
approach greatly improves training efficiency and convergence speedily while
maintaining accuracy and physical interpretability. By applying GNEP to the
training of Sb-Te material systems(datasets include crystalline, liquid, and
disordered phases), the fitting time has been substantially reduced-often by
orders of magnitude-compared to the NEP training framework. The fitted
potentials are validated by DFT reference calculations, demonstrating
satisfactory agreement in equation of state and radial distribution functions.
These results confirm that GNEP retains high predictive accuracy and
transferability while considerably improved computational efficiency, making it
well-suited for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations.

Abstract: A common wisdom about quantum many-body systems is that emergent phases
typically fall into either the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm or topological
classifications. Experimentally realizing the intertwined emergence of
spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological order remains challenging. Here,
we present an experimentally accessible platform for studying magnetic
topological states in a spin-orbit-coupled Lieb lattice. Remarkably, we observe
the coexistence of topological characteristics, quantified by the Chern number
and Bott index, with spontaneous symmetry-breaking orders, such as
ferrimagnetism, in the many-body ground states. Computational analyses
combining dynamical mean-field theory and Hartree-Fock approximations reveal a
pronounced parameter regime where magnetic topological insulators emerge even
under weak interactions. This unconventional phenomenon originates from the
Lieb lattice's unique band structure, which facilitates the synergy between
interaction-driven symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling induced band
inversion. Crucially, spin polarization and spin winding co-emerge as
inherently coupled phenomena due to their shared origin in the same
interacting, spinful atoms. We further propose a specific experimental
implementation scheme for ultracold atoms, utilizing currently available Raman
lattice techniques. Our findings pave the way for exploring the interplay
between symmetry-broken states and topological order in strongly correlated

Abstract: Supersolids formed from dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) exhibit
spontaneous density modulation while maintaining global phase coherence. This
state of matter supports gapped amplitude (Higgs) excitations featuring a
quadratic dispersion relation. While Higgs modes are typically strongly damped
due to coupling with other amplitude and phase modes, imposing an
experimentally realistic toroidal geometry allows us to numerically study the
time evolution and dispersion of a localized Higgs quasiparticle excitation,
with minimal residual coupling to sound modes. Strikingly, the quadratic
dispersion leads to the occurrence of (fractional) revivals, similar to those
seen in the optical Talbot effect or the so-called quantum carpets. The revival
times provide a novel method for determining the effective mass of the Higgs
particle through a non-spectroscopic approach. These results pave the way for
further studies of coherent Higgs dynamics and mutual interactions between
Higgs particles.

Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and
metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms.
Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting
the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain
the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we
demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without
active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting
fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination
fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%.
Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds
for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with
constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast
atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce
parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved
single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the
near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by
blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited
spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy
in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical
lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum

Conclusion: 研究揭示了非平衡动力学在一阶量子相变中的复杂标度行为，为理解量子相变提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium Kibble-Zurek (KZ) dynamics in quantum Ising
chains in a transverse field, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field
$h(t)=t/t_s$ ($t_s$ is the time scale of the protocol), across their
first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) at $h=0$. The KZ protocol starts at
time $t_i<0$ from the negatively magnetized ground state for $h_i = t_i/t_s<0$.
Then, the system evolves unitarily up to a time $t_f > 0$, such that the
magnetization of the state at time $t_f$ is positive. In finite-size systems,
the KZ dynamics develops out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS)
behaviors. Their scaling variables depend either exponentially or with a power
law on the size, depending on the boundary conditions (BC). The OFSS functions
can be computed in effective models restricted to appropriate low-energy
(magnetized and/or kink) states. The KZ scaling behavior drastically changes in
the thermodynamic limit (TL), defined as the infinite-size limit keeping $t$
and $t_s$ fixed, which appears substantially unrelated with the OFSS regime,
because it involves higher-energy multi-kink states, which are irrelevant in
the OFSS limit. The numerical analyses of the KZ dynamics in the TL show the
emergence of a quantum spinodal-like scaling behavior at the FOQTs for all
considered BC, which is independent of the BC. The longitudinal magnetization
changes sign at $h(t)=h*>0$, where $h*$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, as
$h*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. Moreover, in the large-$t_s$ limit, the time-dependence of
the magnetization is described by a universal function of $\Omega = t/\tau_s$,
with $\tau_s = t_s/\ln t_s$.

Abstract: Stressed under a constant load, materials creep with a final acceleration of
deformation and for any given applied stress and material, the creep failure
time can strongly vary. We investigate creep on sheets of paper and confront
the statistics with a simple fiber bundle model of creep failure in a
disordered landscape. In the experiments, acoustic emission event times $t_j$
were recorded, and both this data and simulation event series reveal
sample-dependent history effects with log-normal statistics and non-Markovian
behavior. This leads to a relationship between $t_j$ and the failure time $t_f$
with a power law relationship, evolving with time. These effects and the
predictability result from how the energy gap distribution develops during
creep.

Abstract: Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how
variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide
a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies,
revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within
complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as
gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is
essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position
$\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation
with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific
function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the
autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by
Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the
second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is
restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is
introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at
$T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal
analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function.
In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics
underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of
modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the
correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper
critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent
$\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been
questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising
model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold
even when $d$ is not an integer.

Motivation: 探索量子系统在非平衡条件下的动态行为，特别是通过KZ协议驱动时，系统如何响应时间依赖的纵向场。

Method: 采用KZ协议，从负磁化基态出发，通过时间依赖的纵向场驱动系统，研究其动态响应和有限尺寸效应。

Result: 发现有限尺寸系统中存在非平衡有限尺寸标度行为，而在热力学极限下则表现出量子自旋态标度行为。

Conclusion: KZ动力学在有限尺寸和热力学极限下表现出不同的标度行为，揭示了量子相变中的动态复杂性。

Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium Kibble-Zurek (KZ) dynamics in quantum Ising
chains in a transverse field, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field
$h(t)=t/t_s$ ($t_s$ is the time scale of the protocol), across their
first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) at $h=0$. The KZ protocol starts at
time $t_i<0$ from the negatively magnetized ground state for $h_i = t_i/t_s<0$.
Then, the system evolves unitarily up to a time $t_f > 0$, such that the
magnetization of the state at time $t_f$ is positive. In finite-size systems,
the KZ dynamics develops out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS)
behaviors. Their scaling variables depend either exponentially or with a power
law on the size, depending on the boundary conditions (BC). The OFSS functions
can be computed in effective models restricted to appropriate low-energy
(magnetized and/or kink) states. The KZ scaling behavior drastically changes in
the thermodynamic limit (TL), defined as the infinite-size limit keeping $t$
and $t_s$ fixed, which appears substantially unrelated with the OFSS regime,
because it involves higher-energy multi-kink states, which are irrelevant in
the OFSS limit. The numerical analyses of the KZ dynamics in the TL show the
emergence of a quantum spinodal-like scaling behavior at the FOQTs for all
considered BC, which is independent of the BC. The longitudinal magnetization
changes sign at $h(t)=h*>0$, where $h*$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, as
$h*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. Moreover, in the large-$t_s$ limit, the time-dependence of
the magnetization is described by a universal function of $\Omega = t/\tau_s$,
with $\tau_s = t_s/\ln t_s$.

Abstract: Stressed under a constant load, materials creep with a final acceleration of
deformation and for any given applied stress and material, the creep failure
time can strongly vary. We investigate creep on sheets of paper and confront
the statistics with a simple fiber bundle model of creep failure in a
disordered landscape. In the experiments, acoustic emission event times $t_j$
were recorded, and both this data and simulation event series reveal
sample-dependent history effects with log-normal statistics and non-Markovian
behavior. This leads to a relationship between $t_j$ and the failure time $t_f$
with a power law relationship, evolving with time. These effects and the
predictability result from how the energy gap distribution develops during
creep.

Abstract: Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how
variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide
a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies,
revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within
complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as
gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is
essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position
$\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation
with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific
function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the
autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by
Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the
second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is
restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is
introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at
$T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal
analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function.
In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics
underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of
modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the
correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper
critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent
$\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been
questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising
model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold
even when $d$ is not an integer.

Conclusion: 该方法为混合态SPT不变量的提取提供了新工具，并展示了在实验中的潜在应用。

Abstract: We propose a bulk order parameter for extracting symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) invariants of quantum many-body mixed states on a two
dimensional lattice using partial symmetries. The procedure builds on the
partial symmetry order parameter recently developed by some of the authors to
study SPT phases of pure states and adapts them to the decohered setting. For a
symmetry $G = E \times A$ where $E$ is a strong symmetry and $A$ is a weak
symmetry, we show that the partial symmetry order parameter detects SPT
invariants jointly protected by $E$ and $A$. We demonstrate this explicitly
using a class of mixed states obtained from CZX-type models with
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and subjecting them to noise that
weakens one of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. We also comment on the practical
detection of SPT invariants in quantum simulators through randomized
measurements.

Abstract: Interplay of strong correlation and flat topological band has been a central
problem in moir\'e systems such as the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG). Recent studies show that Mott-like states may still be possible in TBG
despite the Wannier obstruction. However, the nature of such unconventional
states is still not well understood. In this work we construct the ground state
wavefunction and exotic excitations of a symmetric correlated semimetal or
insulator at even integer filling using a parton mean field theory of the
topological heavy fermion model. We label the valence of the $f$ orbital based
on its occupation $n_f$. At $\nu=-2$, we show that the $f$ orbital is not in
the simple $f^{2+}$ valence expected from a trivial Mott localization. Instead,
around $1/3$ of AA sites are self doped, with holes entering the $c$ orbitals
away from AA sites. As a result, the $f$ orbital is in a superposition of
$f^{2+}$ and $f^{3+}$ valences and should not be viewed as local moment. We dub
the phase as \textit{mixed valence Mott insulator}. This unconventional
insulator has a large hybridization $\langle c^\dagger f \rangle\neq 0$ and is
sharply distinct from the usual `kondo breakdown' picture. In most of the
momentum space away from the $\Gamma$ point, there is a Mott gap equal to the
Hubbard $U$. At the $\Gamma$ point, we have a `charge transfer gap' much
smaller than $U$. In particular, the top of the lower band is dominated by a
composite excitation, which is a linear combination of $|f^{1+}\rangle\langle
f^{2+}|$ and $|f^{2+}\rangle\langle f^{3+}|$ with a sign structure such that it
is orthogonal to the microscopic $f$ operator. At $\nu=0$, similar approach
leads to a Mott semimetal. We hope this work will inspire more explorations of
the Anderson models with a large hybridization, a regime which may host new
physics beyond the familiar Kondo or heavy fermion systems.

Abstract: We investigate the symmetry-enforced line nodes of the triplet excitations of
XCuCl$_{3}$ (X= K, Tl), showing that they are protected by the nonsymmorphic
symmetries and are unaffected by the microscopic details, such as interaction
and anisotropy strength, as long as the ground state and the symmetry group
remain unaltered. Extending the conventionally used isotropic spin model for
XCuCl$_{3}$, our analysis includes all the symmetry-allowed anisotropies and
gives a detailed account of the role they play in the band topology of
triplets. We show that the triplet line nodes carry nontrivial Berry phases and
compute their $Z_2$ topological indices. To investigate the effect of breaking
the nonsymmorphic symmetry protecting the triplet nodes, we apply a magnetic
field tilted away from the high symmetry $(010)$ axis. We find that while the
g-tensor anisotropy behaves as a trivial mass gapping out the triplets,
exchange anisotropies supply a nontrivial momentum-dependent mass term.
Analogous to Haldane's original model, the competition of these mass terms
determines the nature of the band topology in XCuCl$_{3}$. To enable an
analytic study of the band topology we derive an effective Dirac Hamiltonian
and validate it by computing the band structure and topological indices in the
nodal line and gapped phases from the linear bond-wave formalism.

Abstract: Strange metal behavior has been observed in an expanding list of quantum
materials, with heavy fermion metals serving as a prototype setting. Among the
intriguing questions is the nature of charge carriers; there is an increasing
recognition that the quasiparticles are lost, as captured by Kondo destruction
quantum criticality. Among the recent experimental advances is the measurement
of shot noise in a heavy-fermion strange metal. We are thus motivated to study
current fluctuations by advancing a minimal Bose-Fermi Kondo lattice model,
which admits a well-defined large-$N$ limit. Showing that the model in
equilibrium captures the essential physics of Kondo destruction, we proceed to
derive quantum kinetic equations and compute shot noise to the leading
nontrivial order in $1/N$. Our results reveal a strong suppression of the shot
noise at the Kondo destruction quantum critical point, thereby providing the
understanding of the striking experiment. Broader implications of our results
are discussed.

Conclusion: 同伦延拓方法有效解决了Dyson方程的收敛和多解问题，揭示了NdNiO2中电子关联的新特性。

Abstract: Solution of the Dyson equation for the small-gap systems can be plagued by
large non-converging iterations. In addition to the convergence issues, due to
a high non-linearity, the Dyson equation may have multiple solutions. We apply
the homotopy continuation approach to control the behavior of iterations. We
used the homotopy continuation to locate multiple fully self-consistent GW
solutions for NdNiO2 solid and to establish the corresponding Hartree-Fock
limits. Some of the solutions found are qualitatively new and help to
understand the nature of electron correlation in this material. We show that
there are multiple low-energy charge-transfer solutions leading to a formation
of charge-density waves. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental
conductivity measurements. To rationalize the structure of solutions, we
compare the k-point occupations and generalize the concept of natural
difference orbitals for correlated periodic solids.

Abstract: We consider the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain with diagonal boundary fields
and solve it exactly using Bethe ansatz in the gapped anti-ferromagnetic regime
and obtain the complete phase boundary diagram. Depending on the values of the
boundary fields, the system exhibits several phases which can be categorized
based on the ground state exhibited by the system and also based on the number
of bound states localized at the boundaries. We show that the Hilbert space is
comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of
boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary
phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical
values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the
ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the
`Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space
changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary
bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization
techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the
ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each
eigenstate.

Abstract: A microscopic mechanism is proposed for a dramatic sign change of the Seebeck
coefficient from positive to negative sign by the introduction of antisite
defects in Fe$_2$VAl based on bipolar random Anderson model (BPRAM), which
incorporates hybridization effects between randomly distributed antisites and
host bands, where the valence and conduction bands are treated separately due
to their separation in momentum space. Applying a self-consistent T-matrix
approximation, we find that antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl induce new states in
the band overlap region, resulting in a scattering rate that is higher for hole
carriers in the valence band than that for electron carriers in the conduction
band, leading to negative Seebeck coefficient. This mechanism of sign change
presents a potential new approach for controlling thermoelectric properties in
semimetallic systems without changing carrier concentration.

Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops
in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild
conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which
must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further
elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths,
`pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily
evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been
studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We
construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry
groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we
find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still
entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the
non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between
these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in
Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying
the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This
additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase
diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the
Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT
example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group
cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above
in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the
invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain
SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are
not manifolds.

Abstract: Following the discovery of graphene, interest in van der Waals (vdW)
materials has surged; yet, advancing "beyond graphene" physics requires the
development of quantum material platforms that host versatile many-body states.
Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 300 mK, we uncover two
competing states in vdW metal CeTe3: charge-ordered in-plane antiferromagnetic
phases forming stripe and checkerboard patterns. Remarkably, the competition
between them is tuned through a modest in-plane magnetic field (approximately
1.5 T), revealing significant cooperative phenomena between frustrated
antiferromagnetism, charge order, and competing Fermi surface nesting.
Underlying strongly intertwined many-body states are consistently signaled by
density of states deformations exceeding plus/minus 30 meV scale across the
Fermi level. Our findings provide a promising correlated vdW platform hosting
versatile two-dimensional many-body physics, offering a fertile ground to
explore topologically nontrivial multi-q charge-ordered antiferromagnetism,
quantum criticality, unconventional superconductivity, and their potential
interconnections.

Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), the recently discovered third class of collinear
magnetic order, is characterized by non-relativistic momentum-dependent
spin-split electronic structure with compensated zero net magnetization. It can
arise from the conventional antiferromagnetism by introducing local anisotropy
on the two opposite-spin sublattices, either through structural changes in
local crystallographic symmetry or spontaneous emergence of local staggered
orbital order from electron correlations in multi-orbital systems. Here, we
demonstrate on the two-dimensional square lattice that a $d$-wave AM can emerge
spontaneously in the single-orbital extended Hubbard model, without invoking
the spin-orbital coupling and multi-orbital physics. We carry out mean-field
studies on the concrete single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V$ model with $U$ and $V$ the
onsite and nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, obtaining the ground states,
analyzing their properties, and determining the phase diagram in the $U$-$V$
plane. The $d$-wave AM with novel spin-transport behavior is found to be
stabilized in a wide region of the phase diagram when the system is doped away
from half-filling, actualized by the coexistence of onsite antiferromagnetic
order and complex $d$-wave nearest-neighbor spin bond orders. Our findings
provide an alternative route to achieve AM and substantially expand the range
of candidate AM materials.

Abstract: We propose a bulk order parameter for extracting symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) invariants of quantum many-body mixed states on a two
dimensional lattice using partial symmetries. The procedure builds on the
partial symmetry order parameter recently developed by some of the authors to
study SPT phases of pure states and adapts them to the decohered setting. For a
symmetry $G = E \times A$ where $E$ is a strong symmetry and $A$ is a weak
symmetry, we show that the partial symmetry order parameter detects SPT
invariants jointly protected by $E$ and $A$. We demonstrate this explicitly
using a class of mixed states obtained from CZX-type models with
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and subjecting them to noise that
weakens one of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. We also comment on the practical
detection of SPT invariants in quantum simulators through randomized
measurements.

Abstract: Recently observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall materials (FQAH) are
candidates for topological quantum hardware, but their required anyon states
are elusive. We point out dependence on monodromy in the fragile band topology
in 2-cohomotopy. An algebro-topological theorem of Larmore & Thomas (1980) then
identifies FQAH anyons over momentum space. Admissible braiding phases are
2C-th roots of unity, for C the Chern number. This lays the foundation for
understanding symmetry-protected topological order in FQAH systems, reducing
the problem to computations in equivariant cohomotopy.

Abstract: Interplay of strong correlation and flat topological band has been a central
problem in moir\'e systems such as the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene
(TBG). Recent studies show that Mott-like states may still be possible in TBG
despite the Wannier obstruction. However, the nature of such unconventional
states is still not well understood. In this work we construct the ground state
wavefunction and exotic excitations of a symmetric correlated semimetal or
insulator at even integer filling using a parton mean field theory of the
topological heavy fermion model. We label the valence of the $f$ orbital based
on its occupation $n_f$. At $\nu=-2$, we show that the $f$ orbital is not in
the simple $f^{2+}$ valence expected from a trivial Mott localization. Instead,
around $1/3$ of AA sites are self doped, with holes entering the $c$ orbitals
away from AA sites. As a result, the $f$ orbital is in a superposition of
$f^{2+}$ and $f^{3+}$ valences and should not be viewed as local moment. We dub
the phase as \textit{mixed valence Mott insulator}. This unconventional
insulator has a large hybridization $\langle c^\dagger f \rangle\neq 0$ and is
sharply distinct from the usual `kondo breakdown' picture. In most of the
momentum space away from the $\Gamma$ point, there is a Mott gap equal to the
Hubbard $U$. At the $\Gamma$ point, we have a `charge transfer gap' much
smaller than $U$. In particular, the top of the lower band is dominated by a
composite excitation, which is a linear combination of $|f^{1+}\rangle\langle
f^{2+}|$ and $|f^{2+}\rangle\langle f^{3+}|$ with a sign structure such that it
is orthogonal to the microscopic $f$ operator. At $\nu=0$, similar approach
leads to a Mott semimetal. We hope this work will inspire more explorations of
the Anderson models with a large hybridization, a regime which may host new
physics beyond the familiar Kondo or heavy fermion systems.

Abstract: We investigate the symmetry-enforced line nodes of the triplet excitations of
XCuCl$_{3}$ (X= K, Tl), showing that they are protected by the nonsymmorphic
symmetries and are unaffected by the microscopic details, such as interaction
and anisotropy strength, as long as the ground state and the symmetry group
remain unaltered. Extending the conventionally used isotropic spin model for
XCuCl$_{3}$, our analysis includes all the symmetry-allowed anisotropies and
gives a detailed account of the role they play in the band topology of
triplets. We show that the triplet line nodes carry nontrivial Berry phases and
compute their $Z_2$ topological indices. To investigate the effect of breaking
the nonsymmorphic symmetry protecting the triplet nodes, we apply a magnetic
field tilted away from the high symmetry $(010)$ axis. We find that while the
g-tensor anisotropy behaves as a trivial mass gapping out the triplets,
exchange anisotropies supply a nontrivial momentum-dependent mass term.
Analogous to Haldane's original model, the competition of these mass terms
determines the nature of the band topology in XCuCl$_{3}$. To enable an
analytic study of the band topology we derive an effective Dirac Hamiltonian
and validate it by computing the band structure and topological indices in the
nodal line and gapped phases from the linear bond-wave formalism.

Abstract: Strange metal behavior has been observed in an expanding list of quantum
materials, with heavy fermion metals serving as a prototype setting. Among the
intriguing questions is the nature of charge carriers; there is an increasing
recognition that the quasiparticles are lost, as captured by Kondo destruction
quantum criticality. Among the recent experimental advances is the measurement
of shot noise in a heavy-fermion strange metal. We are thus motivated to study
current fluctuations by advancing a minimal Bose-Fermi Kondo lattice model,
which admits a well-defined large-$N$ limit. Showing that the model in
equilibrium captures the essential physics of Kondo destruction, we proceed to
derive quantum kinetic equations and compute shot noise to the leading
nontrivial order in $1/N$. Our results reveal a strong suppression of the shot
noise at the Kondo destruction quantum critical point, thereby providing the
understanding of the striking experiment. Broader implications of our results
are discussed.

Conclusion: 通过比较k点占据和推广自然差异轨道概念，解释了多解结构，为理解电子关联性质提供了新视角。

Abstract: Solution of the Dyson equation for the small-gap systems can be plagued by
large non-converging iterations. In addition to the convergence issues, due to
a high non-linearity, the Dyson equation may have multiple solutions. We apply
the homotopy continuation approach to control the behavior of iterations. We
used the homotopy continuation to locate multiple fully self-consistent GW
solutions for NdNiO2 solid and to establish the corresponding Hartree-Fock
limits. Some of the solutions found are qualitatively new and help to
understand the nature of electron correlation in this material. We show that
there are multiple low-energy charge-transfer solutions leading to a formation
of charge-density waves. Our results qualitatively agree with the experimental
conductivity measurements. To rationalize the structure of solutions, we
compare the k-point occupations and generalize the concept of natural
difference orbitals for correlated periodic solids.

Conclusion: 边界场的变化会导致不同类型的相变，揭示了边界束缚态与希尔伯特空间结构的关系。

Abstract: We consider the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain with diagonal boundary fields
and solve it exactly using Bethe ansatz in the gapped anti-ferromagnetic regime
and obtain the complete phase boundary diagram. Depending on the values of the
boundary fields, the system exhibits several phases which can be categorized
based on the ground state exhibited by the system and also based on the number
of bound states localized at the boundaries. We show that the Hilbert space is
comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of
boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary
phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical
values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the
ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the
`Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space
changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary
bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization
techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the
ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each
eigenstate.

Conclusion: 该机制为调控半金属系统热电性能提供了新方法。

Abstract: A microscopic mechanism is proposed for a dramatic sign change of the Seebeck
coefficient from positive to negative sign by the introduction of antisite
defects in Fe$_2$VAl based on bipolar random Anderson model (BPRAM), which
incorporates hybridization effects between randomly distributed antisites and
host bands, where the valence and conduction bands are treated separately due
to their separation in momentum space. Applying a self-consistent T-matrix
approximation, we find that antisite defects in Fe$_2$VAl induce new states in
the band overlap region, resulting in a scattering rate that is higher for hole
carriers in the valence band than that for electron carriers in the conduction
band, leading to negative Seebeck coefficient. This mechanism of sign change
presents a potential new approach for controlling thermoelectric properties in
semimetallic systems without changing carrier concentration.

Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops
in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild
conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which
must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further
elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths,
`pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily
evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been
studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We
construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry
groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we
find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still
entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the
non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between
these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in
Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying
the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This
additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase
diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the
Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT
example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group
cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above
in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the
invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain
SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are
not manifolds.

Abstract: Following the discovery of graphene, interest in van der Waals (vdW)
materials has surged; yet, advancing "beyond graphene" physics requires the
development of quantum material platforms that host versatile many-body states.
Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at 300 mK, we uncover two
competing states in vdW metal CeTe3: charge-ordered in-plane antiferromagnetic
phases forming stripe and checkerboard patterns. Remarkably, the competition
between them is tuned through a modest in-plane magnetic field (approximately
1.5 T), revealing significant cooperative phenomena between frustrated
antiferromagnetism, charge order, and competing Fermi surface nesting.
Underlying strongly intertwined many-body states are consistently signaled by
density of states deformations exceeding plus/minus 30 meV scale across the
Fermi level. Our findings provide a promising correlated vdW platform hosting
versatile two-dimensional many-body physics, offering a fertile ground to
explore topologically nontrivial multi-q charge-ordered antiferromagnetism,
quantum criticality, unconventional superconductivity, and their potential
interconnections.

Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM), the recently discovered third class of collinear
magnetic order, is characterized by non-relativistic momentum-dependent
spin-split electronic structure with compensated zero net magnetization. It can
arise from the conventional antiferromagnetism by introducing local anisotropy
on the two opposite-spin sublattices, either through structural changes in
local crystallographic symmetry or spontaneous emergence of local staggered
orbital order from electron correlations in multi-orbital systems. Here, we
demonstrate on the two-dimensional square lattice that a $d$-wave AM can emerge
spontaneously in the single-orbital extended Hubbard model, without invoking
the spin-orbital coupling and multi-orbital physics. We carry out mean-field
studies on the concrete single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V$ model with $U$ and $V$ the
onsite and nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, obtaining the ground states,
analyzing their properties, and determining the phase diagram in the $U$-$V$
plane. The $d$-wave AM with novel spin-transport behavior is found to be
stabilized in a wide region of the phase diagram when the system is doped away
from half-filling, actualized by the coexistence of onsite antiferromagnetic
order and complex $d$-wave nearest-neighbor spin bond orders. Our findings
provide an alternative route to achieve AM and substantially expand the range
of candidate AM materials.

Abstract: Altermagnetism provides new routes to realize Majorana zero modes with
vanishing net magnetization. We consider a recently proposed heterostructure
consisting of a semiconducting wire on top of an altermagnet and with
proximity-induced superconductivity. We demonstrate that rotating the wire
serves as a tuning knob to induce the topological phase. For $d$-, $g$- and
$i$-wave altermagnetic pairing, we derive angle-dependent topological
gap-closing conditions. We derive symmetry constraints on angles where the
induced altermagnetism must vanish, which we verify by explicit models. Our
results imply that a bent or curved wire realizes a spatially-dependent
topological invariant with Majorana zero modes pinned to positions where the
topological invariant changes. This provides a new experimental set-up whereby
a single wire can host both topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes
without $in$ $situ$ tuning.

Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are bound midgap excitations at the ends of a 1D
topological superconductor, which must come in pairs. If the two MZMs in the
pair are sufficiently well-separated by a distance much larger than their
individual localization length, then the MZMs behave as non-Abelian anyons
which can be braided to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum
computation. In this `topological' regime of well-separated MZMs, their overlap
is exponentially small, leading to exponentially small Majorana splitting, thus
enabling the MZMs to be topologically protected by the superconducting gap. In
real experimental samples, however, the existence of disorder and the finite
length of the 1D wire considerably complicates the situation leading to
ambiguities in defining `topology' since the Majorana splitting between the two
end modes may not necessarily be small in disordered wires of short length. We
theoretically study this situation by calculating the splitting in
experimentally relevant short disordered wires, and explicitly investigating
the applicability of the `exponential protection' constraint as a function of
disorder, wire length, and other system parameters. We find that the
exponential regime is highly constrained, and is suppressed for disorder
somewhat less than the topological superconducting gap. We provide detailed
results and discuss the implications of our theory for the currently active
experimental search for MZMs in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid platforms.

Abstract: The appearance of fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e systems can be
rationalized by the presence of a fictitious magnetic field associated with the
spatial texture of layer-resolved electronic wavefunctions. Here, we present a
systematic study of real-space topology and the associated fictitious magnetic
fields in moir\'e systems. We first show that at the level of individual Bloch
wavefunctions, the real-space Chern number, akin to a Pontryagin index, is a
fragile marker. It generically vanishes except for specific limits where the
Bloch functions exhibit fine-tuned zeroes within the unit cell, such as the
chiral limit of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) or the adiabatic regime of
twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). We then show that
these limitations do not apply to textures associated with ensembles of Bloch
wavefunctions, such as entire bands or the ensemble of states at a given
energy. The Chern number of these textures defines a robust topological index
protected by a spectral gap. We find that symmetries constrain it to be nonzero
for both twisted TMDs and TBG across all twist angles and levels of
corrugation, implying experimental signatures in scanning tunneling microscopy
measurements. We also study real-space topology within the topological heavy
fermion model of TBG, finding that the real-space topological features are
supported only by the light c-electrons.

Method: 制造了3-5 Å高度的蛭石层状结构，研究了K+、Ca2+和Al3+插层蛭石在不同门电压和盐浓度下的电导行为。

Abstract: Manipulating the electrostatic double layer and tuning the conductance in
nanofluidic systems at salt concentrations of 100 mM or higher has been a
persistent challenge. The primary reasons are (i) the short electrostatic
proximity length, ~3-10 {\AA}, and (ii) difficulties in fabricating atomically
small capillaries. Here, we successfully fabricate in-plane vermiculite
laminates with transport heights of ~3-5 {\AA}, which exhibit a cation
selectivity close to 1 even at a 1000 mM concentration, suggesting an
overlapping electrostatic double layer. For gate voltages from -2 V to +1 V,
the K+-intercalated vermiculite shows a remarkable conductivity modulation
exceeding 1400% at a 1000 mM KCl concentration. The gated ON/OFF ratio is
mostly unaffected by the ion concentration (10-1000 mM), which confirms that
the electrostatic double layer overlaps with the collective ion movement within
the channel with reduced activation energy. In contrast, vermiculite laminates
intercalated with Ca2+ and Al3+ ions display reduced conductance with
increasing negative gate voltage, highlighting the importance of ion-specific
gating effects under {\AA}-scale confinement. Our findings contribute to a
deeper understanding of electrostatic phenomena occurring in highly confined
fluidic channels, opening the way to the exploration of the vast library of
two-dimensional materials.

Abstract: Ultraclean, undoped carbon nanotubes are always insulating, even when the gap
predicted by band theory is zero. The residual, observed gap is thought to have
a many-body origin. Here we theoretically show that the correlated insulator is
excitonic, extending our previous claim, limited to gapless (armchair) tubes

Rontani, Nature Communications $\mathbf{8}$, 1461 (2017)], to $all$ narrow-gap
tubes, irrespective of their size. By enhancing the two-band model with an
accurate treatment of screening, validated from first principles, we derive the
scaling law of the exciton binding energy with the tube radius and chirality,
and compute self-consistently the fundamental transport gap of the excitonic
insulator. Our findings point to the broader connection between the exciton
length scale, dictated by structure, and the stability of the excitonic phase.

Conclusion: 提出了一种多粒子机制，适用于任何晶体取向的HgTe量子阱，揭示了电子-电子相互作用在能级杂化中的关键作用。

Abstract: We present far-infrared magnetospectroscopy measurements of a HgTe quantum
well in the inverted band structure regime over the temperature range of 2 to
60 K. The particularly low electron concentration enables us to probe the
temperature evolution of all four possible optical transitions originating from
zero-mode Landau levels, which are split off from the edges of the
electron-like and hole-like bands. By analyzing their resonance energies, we
reveal an unambiguous breakdown of the single-particle picture indicating that
the explanation of the anticrossing of zero-mode Landau levels in terms of bulk
and interface inversion asymmetries is insufficient. Instead, the observed
behavior of the optical transitions is well explained by their hybridization
driven by electron-electron interaction. We emphasize that our proposed
many-particle mechanism is intrinsic to HgTe quantum wells of any
crystallographic orientation, including (110) and (111) wells, where bulk and
interface inversion asymmetries do not induce the anticrossing of zero-mode
Landau levels.

Motivation: RSOC在自旋电子学和拓扑光子学中起关键作用，但需要一种非侵入性且精确的方法来量化其强度。

Method: 在随机相位近似（RPA）框架下，通过动态介电函数计算电子能量损失函数（EELF）和等离子体激元色散。

Conclusion: 等离子体激元技术为量化TMD异质结构和器件中的RSOC提供了一种非侵入性、精确且可广泛调控的方法。

Abstract: Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) induces strong momentum-dependent spin
splitting and plays a crucial role in fields like spintronics and topological
photonics. We here theoretically investigate the collective excitations in
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) hosting RSOC, and conceive
an approach to precisely quantify the strength of RSOC using plasmons. We
determine the electron energy loss function (EELF) and plasmon dispersions for
n-type ML-TMD from the dynamic dielectric function in the framework of the
standard random phase approximation (RPA). In this system, both optical and
acoustic plasmon modes are observed in the EELF and plasmon dispersions.
Moreover, the plasmonic and spectral properties are tunable by electron density
and dependent on RSOC. Crucially, we identify a minimum energy gap between the
two plasmon modes to serve as a direct spectral signature of the RSOC strength.
These results establish plasmons as a non-invasive, precise, and broadly
tunable technique for determining RSOC in TMD van der Waals heterostructures
and devices.

Result: 无序诱导的共振峰出现在2μ̃，而场驱动的本征响应峰依赖于质量M̃和化学势μ̃。

Conclusion: 3D nodal line semimetals的总带间响应主要由无序诱导的贡献主导。

Abstract: To obtain the total response of the system, the effect of disorder cannot be
neglected, as it introduces a new contribution (i.e. extrinsic) in the total
response of the system. In the study of dynamical (AC) effects, the interband
response exhibits an exotic resonance peak due to interband transitions. Here,
the dynamical interband response of Dirac nodal line semimetal is investigated
by using the quantum kinetic approach. The scattering driven effect is analyzed
under the first-order Born approximation (i.e., in the weak disorder limit) and
reveals a resonance peak at $2\tilde{\mu}$. In contrast, the field driven
intrinsic response peak depends on both the mass ($\tilde{M}$) and chemical
potential ($\tilde{\mu}$). The results indicate that the total interband
response of the 3D nodal line semimetals, is mainly dominated by the disorder
induced contributions.

Abstract: We consider graphene deposited on monolayers of such transition-metal
dichalcogenides like MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoS$_2$, and WS$_2$. Our key objective
is to study the impact of relative twist angle between the monolayers on the
proximity-induced spin-orbital effects and orbital phenomena in graphene. To do
this we used an effective model Hamiltonian for low-energy states, taken from
available literature. The Green function formalism is used to calculate
analytical formula for the spin Hall effect and nonequilibrium spin
polarization in the system. We also determine the valley Hall and valley
polarization effects, and their dependence on the twist angle. We have shown
that the valley Hall conductivity can take the quantized value equal to $\pm 2
e^2/h$.

Conclusion: 无序或外在贡献对整体响应起主导作用，是研究三维系统响应的关键因素。

Abstract: The anomalous Hall conductivity in the nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) due to
the presence of a symmetry-protected nodal ring adds complexity in the
investigation of their transport properties. By employing quantum kinetic
theory and considering the weak disorder limit, we analyze the intraband and
interband parts of anomalous Hall conductivity in the tilted 3D Dirac NLSMs.
Our findings reveal that the net anomalous response is mainly contributed by
the interband part. Further, the latter part gives non zero results by breaking
inversion symmetry via tilt. We observe that the competition between the tilt
and the chemical potential emerges kinks at distinct characteristic frequencies
in the intrinsic interband part of the anomalous conductivity. On the other
hand, the disorder driven interband component of the conductivity exhibits a
prominent peak at low chemical potential, followed by a sign change. Notably,
the disorder or extrinsic contribution to the response dominates over the
intrinsic interband contribution, making it a crucial factor for the study of
the overall response of a three-dimensional system.

Abstract: Cascades of dynamical phenomena, where energy and motion transfer across
coupled degrees of freedom, underlie complex behavior in physical systems
spanning multiple time and length scales. Here, we demonstrate that
soft-clamping techniques commonly employed to enhance the quality factor of
nanomechanical resonators, can also be harnessed to engineer cascaded energy
transfer conditions, enabling the sequential excitation of an increasing number
of coupled vibrational modes during frequency sweeps. Using Si3N4 nanostrings
with soft-clamping supports, we identify the conditions for mode coupling and
obtain interactions among five flexural resonances , achieving a quasi-constant
amplitude of the targeted resonant response over a broad frequency range.
Analytical and nonlinear reduced-order models reveal that soft clamping can not
only facilitate a sequence of interactions, but also amplify the geometric
nonlinearity of the driven mode, enhancing effective spring hardening by more
than an order of magnitude through dispersive couplings. This ability to
activate and control energy flow in nanomechanical systems offers a strategy
for realizing programmable nonlinear dynamics for next-generation resonators.

Abstract: Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between
non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase
connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such
transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly
beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a
one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain (FC). In particular, we utilize
the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding
states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation
of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for
successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also
demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then
couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable
functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit
states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits.
Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for
implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing
quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information
processing.

Conclusion: 超快泵浦诱导的电子加热是生成TSC的高效机制，高能光电子作用较小。

Abstract: Ultrafast spintronics strongly relies on the generation, transport,
manipulation and detection of terahertz spin currents (TSCs). In F|HM stacks
consisting of a ferromagnetic layer F and a heavy-metal layer HM, ultrafast
spin currents are typically triggered by femtosecond optical laser pulses. A
key open question is whether the initial step, optical excitation and injection
of spin currents, can be controlled by tuning the photon energy of the
femtosecond pulse. While many theoretical works suggest a marked impact of
photon-energy and of highly excited non-thermal electrons, profound
experimental evidence is lacking. Here, we use terahertz-emission spectroscopy
to study TSCs triggered with two different photon energies of 1.5 eV and 3 eV.
We study a wide range of magnetic systems covering metallic ferromagnets,
ferrimagnetic insulators, half-metals, as well as systems including tunneling
barriers, and rare-earth metallic alloys. We find that variation of the
exciting photon energy does not change the dynamics and only slightly the
amplitude of the induced TSC in all sample systems. Our results reveal that the
ultrafast pump-induced heating of electrons is a highly efficient process for
generating TSCs, whereas highly excited primary photoelectrons are of minor
importance.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the orbital Hall effect (OHE) in a strip geometry
and derive a formula for the orbital angular momentum (OAM) accumulation at the
edges. The result is expressed in terms of band structure parameters and
scattering rates, providing a link between experimental observations of the OHE
and the underlying microscopics. A key result is that the effective OAM decay
rate follows a Dykonov-Perel-like scaling and is inversely proportional to the
electron scattering rate, even if the latter is small. Furthermore,
investigating OAM transport in an inhomogeneous setting, we show that non-Ohmic
flows and spatially varying electric fields result in contributions to the OHE
which are distinct from the well known intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms.
