Using the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation supported by variational and sum-rule methods, we show that the intraspin interaction ratio substantially alters the droplet's density profile, driving a transition from Gaussian-like to flat-top shapes. By examining two experimentally relevant parameter regions, we analyze density profiles, radii, peak densities, and excitation spectra to distinguish quantum phases and to depict phase diagrams in the space of asymmetric interaction ratio and total atom number. We carefully study the frequencies of both well-known dipole and breathing modes and less-explored spin dipole and spin breathing modes. The breathing mode frequency decreases monotonically with interaction ratio, approaching asymptotically the result of a conventional weakly interacting Bose gas. It varies non-monotonically with total atom number, peaking at a critical point that highlights the crucial role of quantum fluctuations. In contrast, spin modes display distinct temporal spin density distributions and reveal in-phase and out-of-phase relative dynamics between components. Their frequencies depend instead monotonically on the interaction ratio and atom number. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of asymmetric quantum droplets and link to experimentally accessible regimes in ultracold $^{39}$K atomic gases."}

Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments."}

Based on our \\textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \\textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal.

In this work, we study logical T-gate magic-state preparation in GKP-encoded photonic qubits using a repeat-until-success injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. We develop an architecture-level modeling framework based on a lightweight density-matrix simulator implemented with standard numerical linear algebra. Finite squeezing is mapped to effective logical dephasing, depolarizing noise is included at the logical level, and photon loss is treated as a heralded erasure process. This approach avoids explicit continuous-variable wavefunction simulation, hardware-specific photonic models, and quantum software frameworks, enabling transparent and computationally efficient exploration of architectural trade-offs. We perform systematic parameter sweeps over squeezing values from 8 to 16 dB, baseline loss probabilities between 0.01 and 0.03, and surface-code distances d = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Across this regime, we evaluate repeat-until-success probability, average injection overhead, and logical magic-state fidelity. We find that success probabilities exceed 0.94 across all studied parameters, with an average overhead close to unity. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach approximately 0.77 to 0.80 and show weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but a strong dependence on squeezing. Phase-boundary analysis identifies minimum squeezing requirements needed to simultaneously achieve high success probability and logical fidelity.

However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests.

The binodal densities are not solely determined by a bulk (effective) free energy, but also affected by gradient terms, while capillary waves and Ostwald processes are determined by three distinct interfacial tensions. These and related phenomena were so far explained at continuum level using a top-down minimal theory (Active Model B+). This theory, by Taylor-expanding in the scalar order parameter (or density), effectively assumes that phase separation is weak, which is not true across most of the phase diagram. Here we develop a quantitative account of active phase separation, by introducing an active counterpart of Cahn-Hilliard theory, constructing the density current from all possible terms with up to four spatial derivatives without Taylor-expanding in the density. From this O(grad^4) theory, we show how to compute binodals and interfacial tensions for arbitrary choices of the five density-dependent 'coefficient functions' that specify the theory (replacing the four constant coefficients of Active Model B+). We further consider a particle model composed of thermal quorum-sensing active particles (tQSAPs) yielding a fully specified example of the O(grad^4) theory upon coarse-graining. We find that to coarse-grain consistently at O(grad^4) requires a novel procedure, based on multiple-scale analysis, to systematically eliminate fast-evolving orientational moments. Using this, we calculate from microscopic physics all five coefficient functions of the active Cahn-Hilliard theory for tQSAPs. We identify contributions that were missed in previous continuum theories, and show how neglecting them becomes justified only in the limit of large quorum-sensing range parameter. Comparison with particle simulations of tQSAPs shows that our O(grad^4) theory improves on previous continuum models [...]"}

However, the two challenges, low SOT efficiency and the need for in plane symmetry breaking field for perpendicular magnetization switching, greatly limit its practical implementation. In this work, the enhanced SOT efficiency of Platinum (Pt) SOT layer and field free perpendicular magnetization switching are achieved by integrating thin Ruthenium Oxide (RuO2) layer in our material stack. The optimal RuO2 thickness (0.5 nm) enhances 5.2 times Damping Like (DL) SOT efficiency compared with pure SOT layer (Pt), as determined by hysteresis loop shift measurements, with a relatively low resistivity (90 micro-Ohm-cm). Moreover, we achieve 3 times reduction of critical magnetization switching current density compared to reference sample. Our experimental findings also demonstrate Rashba-induced substantial field-free magnetization switching in the presence of an emergent built-in interfacial field. Notably, reliable multi resistance synaptic states are achieved by tailoring the synergistic effects of enhanced SOT and interfacial magnetism. The functionality of synaptic states has been further evaluated by implementing an artificial neural network and achieved image recognition accuracies of approximately 95% and 87% on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively.

While the Kondo effect has traditionally been understood to suppress magnetism through the formation of local singlets, recent studies suggest that Kondo interactions may enhance magnetic order under certain conditions. However, these scenarios often rely on complex electronic structures, including orbital and charge degrees of freedom, making the essential mechanisms difficult to isolate. Here we report the realization of a spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model in a Ni-based complex-a minimal spin-only analog of the Kondo lattice that isolates quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom. Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition. Perturbative analysis reveals that the Kondo coupling mediates effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin-1 sites, stabilizing the Néel order across the entire chain.

A nanobubble can have many stable stationary states, each characterized by the number of layers, $l$, within the cluster of internal atoms. The layers are circular in shape, concentrically stacked on top of each other, forming an $l$-stepped pyramid with a flat top. The covering of this pyramid with a graphene sheet is achieved through its local stretching. The valence bonds of the sheet stretch only over the group of internal atoms; outside the coverage zone, the sheet remains undeformed and lies flush against the substrate. The maximum possible number of layers, $l_m$, increases monotonically with the number of atoms $N$ ($l_m=6$ for $N=4000$). The graphene sheet, interacting with the substrate, compresses the internal atom cluster against it, generating an internal pressure of $P\\sim 1$ GPa. Numerical simulations of thermal vibrations reveal that among all $l$-layer configurations of a nanobubble, there is always one \"ground\"\\ state. Upon heating, this ground state smoothly transitions into a layerless liquid state. All other stationary states transform into this ground state once a certain temperature is reached (for $N=4000$, the ground state corresponds to state with $l=4$). The coexistence of several stable states with different numbers of layers at low temperatures leads to the absence of a universal shape for the nanobubbles. In this scenario, the height-to-radius ratio, $H/R$, can vary from 0 to 0.24, depending on the number of layers."}

However, each DMFT step is computationally demanding, and many iterations can be required to achieve convergence. Here, we accelerate the convergence of DMFT by initializing its self-consistent cycle with solutions from computationally cheaper and more approximate methods. We compare the initialization with the non-interacting solution to a range of quantum embedding compatible approaches: Hartree-Fock, the Hubbard-I approximation, rotationally invariant slave bosons (RISB), and its ghost extension (g-RISB). We find that these initializations can reduce the number of DMFT iterations by up to an order of magnitude, with g-RISB providing the most effective and reliable benefits. In most regimes, initializing with g-RISB and performing a single DMFT iteration suffices to recover the full dynamical structure. The improvement in convergence is controlled by the initial solution's accuracy in the low-energy part of the self-energy, on the scale of the non-interacting bandwidth. This strategy is especially effective at the Mott insulator-metal transition, where an initialization from the non-interacting limit can lead to a breakdown of DMFT due to the sign problem. Our results establish the usage of accurate yet cheaper quantum embedding methods as a powerful means to substantially reduce the computational cost of DMFT, particularly in regimes where convergence is slow or prone to failure."}

These one-dimensional fermionic (QSSEP) and bosonic (QSSIP) models feature stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping driven by Brownian noise, together with boundary injection and removal processes. They provide solvable microscopic settings in which quantum coherence coexists with diffusion. Upon noise averaging, their dynamics reduce to those of the classical SSEP/SSIP. We show that the cumulant generating function of the integrated current, at large scales, obeys a large deviation principle. To leading order in system size and for each noise realization, it converges to that of the corresponding classical process, establishing a classical typicality of current fluctuations in these noisy quantum systems. We further demonstrate a direct connection with Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT), showing that the large-scale equations satisfied by biased quantum densities coincide with the steady-state Hamilton equations of MFT, thereby providing a microscopic quantum justification of the MFT framework in these models. Finally, we identify the leading finite-size corrections to the current statistics. We show the existence of subleading contributions of purely quantum origin, which are absent in the corresponding classical setting, and provide their explicit expressions for the second and third current cumulants. These quantum corrections are amenable to direct experimental or numerical verification, provided sufficient control over the noise realizations can be achieved.

In this work, we identify entanglement as the key resource that enables local random unitaries to generate global random states by effectively gluing randomness across the system. Specifically, we demonstrate that approximate random states can be produced from an entangled state $|ψ\\rangle$ through the application of local random unitaries. We show that the resulting ensemble forms an approximate state design with an error saturating as $Θ(e^{-\\mathcal{N}_2(ψ)})$, where $\\mathcal{N}_2(ψ)$ is the second Rényi entanglement entropy of $|ψ\\rangle$. Furthermore, we prove that this tight bound also applies to the second Rényi entropy of coherence when the ensemble is constructed using coherence-free operations. These results imply that, when restricted to resource-free gates, the quality of the generated random states is determined entirely by the resource content of the initial state. Notably, we find that among all $α$-Rényi entropeis, the second Rényi entropy yields the tightest bounds. Consequently, these second Rényi entropies can be interpreted as the maximal capacities for generating randomness using resource-free operations. Finally, moving beyond approximate state designs, we utilize this entanglement-assisted gluing mechanism to present a novel method for generating pseudorandom states in multipartite systems from a locally entangled state via pseudorandom unitaries in each of parties."}

The depletion is parametrized by a power-law tail with an exponent $β> 2$. We show that current and electrochemical potential are exponentially suppressed inside a surrounding area much larger than the geometric size of the depletion region. The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $π(1 - 1 / β)$ with respect to the direction of the average electric field. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. In that regime the size of the Landauer dipole is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the depletion. Our results may be useful for interpreting nanoimaging of current distribution in graphene and other two-dimensional systems."}

In this work, we derive and analytically solve the low-energy Kondo theories for SVAIM at half-filling, with especial focus on the two anti-Hund's regimes: the impurity is either dominated by a valley doublet, or a trivial singlet. In the doublet regime, we reveal that a novel pair Kondo scattering $λ_x$ is required to flip the valley doublet, which involves a quartic operator of bath electrons. Our renormalization group (RG) calculation based on the Coulomb gas analog shows $λ_x$ drives a phase transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. One side of the transition is an anisotropic doublet phase, characterized by non-universal phase shifts of bath electrons and non-analytic impurity susceptibilities, while the other is a Fermi liquid formed by pair-Kondo resonance. The finite-size many-body spectrum, thermodynamic quantities, and correlation functions for both phases are analytically solved. Remarkably, the solution in the pair-Kondo Fermi liquid is achieved via the constructive approach of bosonization-refermionization along a solvable fixed line, where the many-body interaction $λ_x$ is mapped into a pseudo-fermion bilinear in a rigorous manner. Finally, we also apply the RG analysis to the singlet regime, and identify a second-order phase transition between the Kondo Fermi liquid and a local singlet phase."}

Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field. Our work not only probes the emergence of CFT features in a quantum simulator, but also provides a technique for diagnosing a priori unknown universality classes in future experiments."}

Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface. These results establish molecular optomechanics as a sensitive probe of surface-molecule interactions and demonstrate how anion-mediated surface dynamics regulate energy flow at plasmonic interfaces."}

In particular, quantum thermodynamical protocols for cooling can be significantly affected, potentially altering both their performance and efficiency. Analytically characterizing the impact of such errors becomes increasingly challenging as the system size grows, particularly in deep quantum circuits where noise can accumulate in complex ways. To address this, we introduce a general framework for approximating the cumulative effect of gate-dependent noise using a global depolarizing channel. We specify the regime in which this approximation provides a reliable description of the noisy dynamics. Applying our framework to the thermodynamical two-sort algorithmic cooling (TSAC) protocol, we analytically derive its asymptotic cooling limit in the presence of noise. Using the cooling limit, the optimal cooling performance is achieved by a finite number of qubits--distinguished from the conventional noiseless TSAC protocol by an infinite number of qubits--and fundamental bounds on the achievable ground-state population are derived. This approach opens new avenues for exploring noisy quantum thermodynamical processes."}

These results demonstrate that wafer scalable CVD graphene, without hBN encapsulation, can host coherent AGP resonances and exhibit an efficient polaritonic enhanced photoresponse under appropriate gating, antenna coupling, and AGP cavity design, opening a route to scalable, polarization and frequency selective, liquid nitrogen cooled, and low power consumption THz detection platforms based on plasmon thermoelectric transduction."}

For fields along both in-plane high-symmetry directions we observe that the spin excitation spectrum at and above a magnetic field of 8~T is gapped. Excitation modes then sharpen for increasing field but are consistently broader than experimental resolution even at 13.5~T. The out-of-plane dispersion diminishes in the 7-10~T regime, signifying enhanced two-dimensional behavior as the in-plane liquid correlations are established. In this regime, excitations are very broad and largely flat for all accessible energy-momenta, which is kinematically at odds with a magnon-decay picture. By contrast, a continuum of fractionalized excitations naturally yields a broad continuum response, which crucially may be accompanied by sharper modes of bound states of fractionalized excitations. Their damping by the continuum accounts for the observed spectral broadening and field dependence. Our results provide strong evidence for the existence of fractionalized excitations in $α$-RuCl$_3$ in a magnetic field."}

Standard formulations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) impose such multi-channel constraints using penalty terms, so most of the explored Hilbert space corresponds to invalid assignments. We propose a subspace-confined QAOA tailored to CBRS multi-channel allocation, in which each node-wise channel register is initialized in a Generalized Dicke state and evolved under an intra-register XY mixer. This ansatz confines the dynamics to a tensor product of Johnson graphs that exactly encode per-node Hamming-weight constraints. For an 8-node CBRS interference graph with 24 qubits, the effective search space is reduced from the full Hilbert space of size $2^{24}$ to 2916 feasible configurations. Within this subspace, the algorithm converges rapidly to low-conflict assignments without large penalty coefficients. Simulations on instances with up to eight nodes show that the proposed ansatz achieves near-optimal conflict levels and consistently outperforms standard penalty-based QAOA and a greedy classical heuristic in terms of feasibility. Noise simulations with depolarizing channels further indicate that the constraint-preserving structure maintains a high feasibility ratio in NISQ-relevant error regimes."}

Here, we demonstrate how the orientation of a nanomagnet relative to the direction of an applied electrical current impacts the threshold current density needed for all-electrical magnetization switching, and how dipolar coupling between the nanomagnets influences the switching of interacting pairs and ensembles of nanomagnets. Using a material system designed to generate SOTs in response to electrical currents, we find that the current required to switch the magnetization of isolated nanomagnets varies non-monotonically as the angle between the nanomagnet long axis and the current increases. In small artificial spin ice systems, we observe similar angular dependence of the switching current, which can be used to control the magnetization orientation of specific subsets of nanomagnets. These experimental results are supported by micromagnetic modeling, which illustrates how the various current induced torques can be exploited to control magnetization switching in nanomagnetic systems. These results establish SOT switching as a practical method for programmable manipulation of dipolar nanomagnetic systems."}

Existing training approaches largely rely on gradient-based procedural optimization, which often suffers from slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and instability near sharp minima. In this work, we propose an alternative inverse-probability algebraic learning framework for QNNs. Instead of updating parameters through incremental gradient descent, our method treats learning as a local inverse problem in probability space, directly mapping discrepancies between predicted and target Born-rule probabilities to parameter corrections via a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian. This algebraic update is covariant, does not require learning-rate tuning, and enables rapid movement toward the vicinity of a loss minimum in a single step. We systematically compare the proposed method with gradient descent and Adam optimization in both regression and classification tasks using a teacher-student QNN benchmark. Our results show that algebraic learning converges significantly faster, escapes loss plateaus, and achieves lower final errors. Under finite-shot sampling, the method exhibits near-optimal error scaling, while remaining robust against intrinsic hardware noise such as dephasing. These findings suggest that inverse-probability algebraic learning offers a principled and practical alternative to procedural optimization for QNN training, particularly in resource-constrained near-term quantum devices."}

This has given rise to hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the quantum device performs only a small but vital part of the overall computation. Among these, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which combine a classical optimization procedure with quantum evaluation of a cost function, have emerged as particularly promising. However, barren plateaus and ill-conditioned optimization landscapes remain among the primary obstacles faced by VQAs, often leading to unstable convergence and high sensitivity to initialization. Motivated by this challenge, we investigate whether a purely classical remedy, standard L2 squared-norm regularization, can systematically stabilize hybrid quantum-classical optimization. Specifically, we augment the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) objective with a quadratic penalty proportional to the squared norm of the parameters, without modifying the quantum circuit or measurement process. Across all tested Hamiltonians, H2, LiH, and the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM), we observe improved performance over a broad window of the regularization strength. Our large-scale numerical results demonstrate that classical regularization provides a robust, system-independent mechanism for mitigating VQE instability, enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of variational quantum optimization without altering the underlying quantum circuit."}

The performance of quantum algorithms is often measured by their query complexity, which quantifies the number of oracle calls required to access the input. The main parameters determining the complexity of QLS solvers are the condition number $κ$ and sparsity $s$ of the linear system, and the target error $ε$. To date, the best known query-complexity lower bound is $Ω(κ\\log(1/ε))$, which establishes the optimality of the most recent QLS solvers. The original proof of this lower bound is attributed to Harrow and Kothari, but their result is unpublished. Furthermore, when discussing a more general lower bound including the sparsity $s$ of the linear system, it has become folklore that it should read as $Ω( κ\\sqrt{s}\\log(1/ε))$. In this work, we establish the rigorous lower bound capturing the sparsity dependence of QLS. We prove the lower bound of $Ω(κ\\sqrt{s})$ for any quantum algorithm that solves QLS with constant error. While the dependence on all parameters $κ,s,ε$ remains an open problem, our result provides a crucial stepping stone toward the complete characterization of QLS complexity."}

In response to this problem, various retargetable quantum compilers have been presented in the scientific literature. These promise the ability to compile software for different hardware platforms, enabling retargetability for quantum software. In this paper, we develop and apply a metric by which the retargetability of the quantum compilers can be assessed. We develop and run a study to analyze key aspects regarding the retargetability of the compilers Tket, Qiskit, and ProjectQ. Our findings indicate that Tket demonstrates the highest level of retargetability, closely followed by Qiskit, while ProjectQ lags behind.

We present a protocol for three-qutrit systems showing that two copies of rank-two biseparable states, entangled across every bipartition, are sufficient to generate a genuinely multipartite entangled state with nonzero probability. This contrasts with the three-qubit scenario where many copies of biseparable states might be required for sharing genuine multipartite entanglement. We subsequently generalize our protocols to the case of an arbitrary number of parties. Our protocol does not rely on the implementation of joint measurements on the copies of states. Interestingly, the proposed construction naturally leads to the activation of genuinely nonlocal correlations, yielding a result that is stronger than genuine multipartite entanglement activation alone."}

But, although process tensors are motivated by an underlying dynamics, it is not a priori clear how to connect to a continuous process tensor object mathematically -- leaving an uncomfortable conceptual gap.

We introduce a fully continuous process tensor framework by showing how the discrete multi-partite Choi state becomes a field-theoretic state in bosonic Fock space, which is intrinsically and rigorously defined in the continuum. With this equipped, we lay out the core structural elements of this framework and its properties. This translation allows for an information-theoretic treatment of multi-time correlations in the continuum via the analysis of their continuous matrix product state representatives.
