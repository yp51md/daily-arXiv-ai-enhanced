This phase is\ncharacterized by a Bogoliubov spectrum consisting of three modes: one mode is\ngapped, while the other two are gapless. When $a_0$ is modulated and half of\nthe modulation frequency lies below the gapped mode, density and spin Faraday\npatterns emerge. In that case, in quasi-one-dimension, the spin texture is\ncharacterized by periodic domains of opposite $z$-polarizations. When driven\nabove the gap, the spin texture is characterized by random orientations of spin\nvectors along the condensate axis. Qualitatively new features appear in the\ndriven quasi-two-dimensional condensate. For instance, when driven above the\ngap, the spin textures are characterized by anomalous vortices and antivortices\nthat do not exhibit phase winding in individual magnetic components.

The spatial spin-spin correlations in quasi-one-dimension\nexhibit a Gaussian envelope, whereas they possess a Bessel function dependence\nin quasi-two-dimension.

Such theories have made great developments in the 50\nyears since 1948. It has played a vital role in enabling the development of\nmodern ultra-fast, stable, and highly dependable information and communication\nsystems. The Shannon theory is supported by the statistical communication\ntheory such as detection and estimation theory. The theory of communication\nsystems that transmit Shannon information using quantum media is called quantum\nShannon information theory, and research began in the 1960s. The theoretical\nformulation comparable to conventional Shannon theory has been completed. Its\nimportant role is to suggest that application of quantum effect will surpass\nexisting communication performance. It would be meaningless if performance,\nefficiency, and utility were to deteriorate due to quantum effects, even if\ncertain new function is given. This paper suggests that there are various\nlimitations to utilizing quantum Shannon information theory to benefit\nreal-world communication systems and presents a theoretical framework for\nachieving the ultimate goal.

Recent works have shown that the training of IQP-QCBM is\nclassically tractable w.r.t. the so-called Gaussian kernel maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) loss function, while maintaining the potential of a quantum\nadvantage for sampling itself. Nonetheless, the model has a number of aspects\nwhere improvements would be important for more general utility: (1) the basic\nmodel is known to be not universal - i.e. it is not capable of representing\narbitrary distributions, and it was not known whether it is possible to achieve\nuniversality by adding hidden (ancillary) qubits; (2) a fixed Gaussian kernel\nused in the MMD loss can cause training issues, e.g., vanishing gradients. In\nthis paper, we resolve the first question and make decisive strides on the\nsecond. We prove that for an $n$-qubit IQP generator, adding $n + 1$ hidden\nqubits makes the model universal. For the latter, we propose a kernel-adaptive\ntraining method, where the kernel is adversarially trained. We show that in the\nkernel-adaptive method, the convergence of the MMD value implies weak\nconvergence in distribution of the generator.

We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay,\nanother topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a\nconstant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of\narchitectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer\nmultiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity\ngraphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay\n(consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit\nensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond\nnorm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is\ntruly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative\nentropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest."}
