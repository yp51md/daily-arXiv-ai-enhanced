Using\nV2O3 as a prototypical metal-insulator transition resistive switching material,\nwe demonstrate that localized focused ion beam irradiation can induce\nstochastic oscillatory dynamics in simple two-terminal switching devices. After\nirradiating the material, we observed an unusual dynamic regime where the\nvoltage induced metallic state momentarily collapses into an insulating state,\nwhich results in a rapid current flickering that is qualitatively different\nfrom the conventional current spiking in a Pearson-Anson type oscillatory\ncircuit implemented using the pristine material. Furthermore, the current\nflickering timing in the irradiated devices becomes progressively more random\nand more sparse with increasing input voltage, resulting in nonlinear and\nnondeterministic oscillatory behavior. The irradiation also leads to a dramatic\nreduction in switching power required to induce the current oscillations. These\nresults are elucidated through random resistor network simulations which\nindicate that a small number of local sites can control the electrical\nmetal-insulator transition switching properties in large devices with high\ndefect concentration.

To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM\nwith the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation\nbetween TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic\nquantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding\ndistillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue\nthat TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine\nnon-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex\ntemporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is\nnegligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of\nmeasurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to\narea-law TE scaling.

Using a classical Hamiltonian\nformalism, we analyze the threshold conditions for parametric instability as a\nfunction of the angle between the microwave pumping field and the external\nmagnetic field, continuously tracing the transition between parallel and\ntransverse pumping. We also describe two competing four-magnon scattering\nmechanisms that transfer parametric magnons toward the bottom of their\nfrequency spectrum: The step-by-step Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade, which is\nallowed for all magnetic field values, and the kinetic instability mechanisms\nthat provide a much more efficient single-step channel in transferring magnons\ndirectly to the lowest-energy states, but occurs within specific regions of the\npumping angle and the external magnetic field where the conservation laws\npermit it.

An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of\nmeasurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to\narea-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d\ncircuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary\npoints, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that\ndynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM.

Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently\nargued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law)\nscaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM\nwith the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation\nbetween TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic\nquantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding\ndistillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue\nthat TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine\nnon-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex\ntemporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is\nnegligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of\nmeasurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to\narea-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d\ncircuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary\npoints, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that\ndynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM.

We model\ndistributed quantum processors using distributed quantum circuits with nonlocal\ntwo-qubit gates, defining the communication complexity of a unitary as the\nminimum number of such nonlocal gates required for its realization.\n  Our contributions are twofold. First, for general $n$-qubit unitaries, we\nimprove upon the trivial $O(4^n)$ communication bound. Considering $k$\npairwise-connected processors (each with $n/k$ data qubits and $m$ ancillas),\nwe prove the communication complexity satisfies $O\\left(\\max\\{4^{(1-1/k)n - m},\nn\\}\\right)$--for example, $O(2^n)$ when $m=0$ and $k=2$--and establish the\ntightness of this upper bound. We further extend the analysis to approximation\nmodels and general network topologies. Second, for special unitaries, we show\nthat both the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Clifford circuits admit\nlinear upper bounds on communication complexity in the exact model,\noutperforming the trivial quadratic bounds applicable to these cases. In the\napproximation model, QFT's communication complexity reduces drastically from\nlinear to logarithmic, while Clifford circuits retain a linear lower bound.\nThese results offer fundamental insights for optimizing communication in\ndistributed quantum unitary implementation, advancing the feasibility of\nlarge-scale distributed quantum computing (DQC) systems."}

We implement an\noriginal method, which involves solving the hydrodynamic continuity equation to\nextract the superfluid fraction tensor from the measured in situ density\ndistribution of the fluid at rest. In parallel, we apply an independent\ndynamical approach that combines compressibility and sound velocity\nmeasurements to determine the superfluid fraction. Both methods yield\nconsistent results in good agreement with simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation as well as with the Leggett bounds determined from the measured\ndensity profiles."}
