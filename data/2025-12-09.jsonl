Here we argue that the combined action of electron-electron interactions and an out-of-equilibrium many-body state can produce striking departures from this familiar picture. We demonstrate how nonequilibrium exchange interactions produce a nonequilibrium collective quantum geometry distinct from that of its equilibrium ground state. We find this manifests as an exchange induced nonlinear Hall effect with nonlinear Hall current signals competitive with that of well-known non-interacting mechanisms. This highlights the critical role electron interactions and nonequilibrium states can play in the nonlinear response of quantum matter."}

The results indicate that the common SOT materials that provide only in-plane torque can provide little to no improvement over spin-transfer-torque (STT) MRAM in terms of write energy. However, emerging SOT materials that provide out-of-plane torques with efficiencies as small as 0.1 can result in significant improvements in the write energy for such 2-terminal devices, especially when the magnet lateral dimensions are scaled down to 30 or 20 nm. Additionally, a novel 2T-SOT MRAM device is proposed that can increase the path electrons pass through the SOT layer; hence, increasing the generated spin current and the energy efficiency of the device. Our benchmarking results indicate that an out-of-plane SOT efficiency of 0.051 for 20nm wide devices can result in write energies approaching SRAM at the 7nm technology node."}

In WSe$_2$ two different twist angles were studied, 3.65° and 5.0°, and two seemingly distinct superconducting phase diagrams were reported, raising the question of whether the superconducting phases in the two devices share a similar origin. Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65° and 5°, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases. More broadly, the smooth phase diagram evolution, repeatability between different devices, and dynamic gate tunability within each device, establish twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a unique platform for the study of correlated phases as the ratio of interaction strength to bandwidth is varied."}

While systematic analysis reveals key design principles, such as field-induced localization for trapping the mobile hole, it becomes computationally intractable for optimization. We show that an autonomous RL agent, benchmarked across five 3D lattices from tetrahedron to FCC, achieves human-competitive accuracy (R^2 > 0.97) and 95.5 percent success on held-out tasks.

This phenomenon has been studied theoretically and experimentally in multimode optical fibers and we argue that it is at the origin of emergence of poverty and oligarchic phases for GDP of countries. A similar phenomenon has been discussed recently in the framework of the Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis to explain the high inequality of wealth distribution in human society and companies at Stock Exchange markets. We show that the Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization well describes the GDP distribution during the last 50 years."}

Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $π$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously.

Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moiré superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range.

We employ Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory to investigate the distinct collective spectra at zero and finite temperatures corresponding to phase separation phenomena stemming from the dipole-dipole interaction of dipolar atomic species. When the dipolar interaction is tuned to be repulsive, the number of zero-energy modes decreases, reflecting the system's tendency towards mixing. For a large number of atoms, we show that the attractive (repulsive) dipolar interaction strengths lead to ground states with non-dipolar (dipolar) atomic species at the periphery, and this leads to a discontinuity in quasiparticle mode evolution. We finally reveal that miscibility driven by thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures exhibits dipole mode hardening, confirmed by the loss of long-range phase coherence through the correlation function. The mode mixing in the dispersion relations ascertains a dipolar strength-dependent miscibility transition and the low-lying quasiparticle mode evolution."}

Using an effective model, we analyze in detail the origins of anomalous oscillations in both clean and disordered cases. Based on these origins, we explain why SOC suppresses or enhances the anomalous oscillations in different cases, thereby extending the understanding of the conventional theory.

Launching new attacks on this long-standing problem -- part of Hilbert's sixth problem -- is urgently important, for focus of statistical phenomena is shifting from a fictitious ensemble to an individual member, i.e. a mechanically isolated system. Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume.

Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators."}

However, the fully etched rings of conventional CBGs restrict the implementation of charge and Stark tuning via electrical contacts. To overcome this limitation, a labyrinth CBG geometry with four bridges has been proposed, yet the added bridges significantly degraded optical performance. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that a periodic labyrinth CBG design preserves both high coupling efficiency and strong Purcell enhancement while enabling electrical integration if optimized after introducing the bridges. We show three optimized designs at emission wavelengths of 780 nm, 930 nm, and 1550 nm, because these wavelengths are among the most relevant for quantum dots and show the general applicability of our approach. At all three wavelengths collection efficiencies exceeding 90% into a numerical aperture of 0.7 and Purcell factors greater than 25 are achieved. Furthermore, we propose a device layout incorporating a barrier layer that separates p- and n-doped semiconductor regions, which is incorporated to prevent tunneling of one of the charge carriers for selective charging. Also this design can be reoptimized to retain the performance of a device without tunnel barrier. These results establish labyrinth CBGs as a platform for electrically tunable quantum dot single-photon sources with high efficiency and scalability."}

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."}

In DQC, after partitioning quantum circuits, they must be scheduled and executed on heterogenous QPUs while balancing latency, overhead, QPU communication resource limits. However, since fully functioning quantum communication networks have not been realized yet, near-term quantum clouds will only rely on local operations and classical communication settings between QPUs, without entangled quantum links. Additionally, existing DQC scheduling frameworks do not account for user-defined execution deadlines and adopt inefficient wire cutting techniques. Accordingly, in this work, a deadline aware DQC scheduling framework with efficient wire cutting for near-term quantum cloud is proposed. The proposed framework schedules partitioned quantum subcircuits while accounting for circuit deadlines and QPU capacity limits. It also captures dependencies between partitioned subcircuits and distributes the execution of the sampling shots on different QPUs to have efficient wire cutting and faster execution. In this regard, a deadline-aware circuit scheduling optimization problem is formulated, and solved using simulated annealing. Simulation results show a marked improvement over existing shot-agnostic frameworks under urgent deadlines, reaching a 12.8% increase in requests served before their deadlines. Additionally, the proposed framework serves 8.16% more requests, on average, compared to state-of-the-art dependency-agnostic baseline frameworks, and by 9.60% versus the dependency-and-shot-agnostic baseline, all while achieving a smaller makespan of the DQC execution.

In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12.

Conical spirals and related structures possess intrinsic in-plane directionalities governed by phase factors $φ_0$, which are often obscured in long spirals due to cylindrical symmetry but become prominent in short spirals or thin films. Using micromagnetic simulations, we systematically studied magnetic textures at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI), including 1D and 2D FCIs with various shapes. Surface spirals (SS) emerge adjacent to these FCIs, closely linked to the cone's in-plane reorientation. In 1D FCIs, reorientation controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of the SS, with a discontinuity point observed where spirals with opposite charges form on opposite sides. In 2D FCIs, eyebrow-like SS are evident. The reorientation angle between top and bottom SS is controlled by the film thickness, similar to stacked spirals reported previously. We further demonstrate that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, as confirmed by both simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy observations in Co$_8$Zn$_{10}$Mn$_2$ thin films. The experiments specifically reveal two distinct formation pathways: thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation from residual helices. These findings establish $φ_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states, enabling promising spintronic functionalities such as multi-state memory through SS polymorphism and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing via controlled topological transitions."}

Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results.

Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas.

These carefully engineered logical qubit states are parameter independent stationary states of the effective master equation governing the evolution of the ensemble and, consequently, constitute dark states and are invulnerable to dissipation and correlated collective dephasing. In particular, the logical qubit states are immune to single qutrit decay (the analogous of single photon loss process for qutrits) and simultaneous decay and driving of two qutrits (the analogous two-photon loss and driving processes for qutrits). In addition, we show how to implement the single-qubit quantum NOT gate and the Hadamard gate followed by either the phase gate or the phase and $Z$ gates. We study analytically the case of two qutrits and conclude that the logical qubit states exhibit parity-sensitive inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing: the even logical state is completely immune to these processes, while odd one is vulnerable. Nevertheless, in the presence of these interactions one can also define another odd state with mixed permutation symmetry that is immune to both inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing. We suggest that these results can be extrapolated to an arbitrary number of qutrits. The effective master equation is deduced from a physical system composed of two parametrically coupled cavities with one of them interacting dispersively with an ensemble of three-level atoms (the qutrits). In principle this physical system can be implemented by means of two coplanar waveguide resonators, a SQUID parametrically coupling them, and a cloud of alkali atoms close to one of the resonators."}

We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$). A key insight is that anisotropy is necessary to activate tensor geometry; isotropic MI forces conformal flatness $g_{ij} \\propto δ_{ij}$, suppressing shear degrees of freedom. We employ a parameterization-invariant unimodular split $g_{ij} = V^{2/D}γ_{ij}$, which rigorously separates local density fluctuations (volume $V$) from directional anisotropy (shape/shear $γ_{ij}$). We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $γ_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy.

Recent advances in quantum computing, particularly quantum linear system solvers, offer promising avenues to accelerate the most computationally intensive steps of IPMs. However, practical challenges such as quantum error, hardware noise, and sensitivity to poorly conditioned systems remain significant obstacles. In response, a series of Quantum IPMs (QIPMs) has been developed to address these challenges, incorporating techniques such as feasibility maintenance, iterative refinement, and preconditioning. In this work, we review this line of research with a focus on our recent contributions, including an almost-exact QIPM framework.

However, because LCU generally requires an ancillary system and complex controlled unitary operators, it is not regarded as a hardware-efficient routine. Recently, a randomized LCU implementation with many applications to early FTQC algorithms has been proposed that computes the same expectation values as the original LCU algorithm using a shallower quantum circuit with a single ancilla qubit, at the cost of a quadratically larger sampling overhead. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm intermediate between the original and randomized LCU that manages the tradeoff between sampling cost and the circuit size. Our algorithm divides the set of unitary operators into several groups and then randomly samples LCU circuits from these groups to evaluate the target expectation value. Notably, we analytically prove an underlying monotonicity: larger group sizes entail smaller sampling overhead, by introducing a quantity called the reduction factor, which determines the sampling overhead across all grouping strategies. Our hybrid algorithm not only enables substantial reductions in circuit depth and ancilla-qubit usage while nearly maintaining the sampling overhead of LCU-based non-Hermitian dynamics simulators, but also achieves intermediate scaling between virtual and coherent quantum linear system solvers. It further provides a virtual ground-state preparation scheme that requires only a resettable single-ancilla qubit and asymptotically shows advantages in both virtual and coherent LCU methods. Finally, by viewing quantum error detection as an LCU process, our approach clarifies when conventional and virtual detection should be applied selectively, thereby balancing sampling and hardware overhead."}

Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems."}

We introduce an acceleration-based adiabatic criterion, consistent with the adiabatic theorem and Landau-Zener theory, that separates adiabatic and diabatic dynamics across the $(T,v)$ plane. The discrete classification agrees with a continuous mean-squared acceleration scale and correlates with a coherence measure given by the ratio of coherence length to the initial packet width $L_φ(t)/σ_0$. We identify a broad Planckian domain in which the dimensionless diffusivity $α\\!=\\!Dm/\\hbar$ is of order unity and only weakly depends on the parameters. This domain is more prevalent in diabatic regions and in areas of reduced phase coherence, indicating a dephasing driven crossover from Anderson localization to Planckian diffusion. Using the Einstein relation together with nearly constant $α$, we directly obtain a low temperature tendency $1/τ_{\\rm tr}\\propto T$, offering a insight to $T$-linear resistivity in strange metals. These results provide a unified picture that links adiabaticity, dephasing, and Planckian diffusion in dynamically disordered quantum-acoustics."}

While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-Büttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials."}

This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories."}

Telecom-band spin-photonic qubits, operating in the 1260-1675 nm wavelength range, are particularly well-suited for long-distance quantum communication due to minimal loss in standard optical fibers. Achieving scalability, however, hinges on fulfilling several stringent criteria: coherent spin-state control, deterministic and indistinguishable single-photon emission, and integration with nanophotonic structures that enhance radiative properties, such as lifetime, coherence, and photon indistinguishability. This study explores the state-of-the-art spin-photonic qubits across solid-state platforms, including diamond color centers, silicon carbide defect centers, quantum dots, and two-dimensional materials. Special attention is given to silicon-based emitters, particularly G, T, C- and Ci-centers, which promise monolithic integration with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and telecom-band operation. We classify these systems based on spin-photon interface availability, CMOS process compatibility, and emitter scalability. We also discuss recent advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), including Purcell enhancement and quality factor engineering in integrated photonic (circuits) environments. The work highlights emerging demonstrations of quantum networking over metropolitan scales and outlines the trajectory toward chip-scale quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs).

This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics."}

In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges. These results identify the transition in $1T$-TaS$_2$ as a three-dimensional, interlayer-driven percolation process and establish this material as a natural, tunable hyperbolic medium."}

The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities."}

High-accuracy variational wavefunctions for the lowest states are used to compute two-dimensional phase-space structures, one-dimensional marginals, and the corresponding Shannon entropies, mutual information, and Cumulative Residual Jeffreys divergences. The analysis shows that the Wigner representation is uniquely responsive to interference effects and displays clear, nonmonotonic entropic behavior as the wells separate, whereas the modulus-Wigner and Husimi distributions account only for geometric splitting or coarse-grained delocalization.

Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation.

Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D.

Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations."}

This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts."}

Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65° and 5°, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases.

By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons.

After general considerations on the significance of tests of the WEP using quantum states and the need for considering inertial and gravitational masses as operators, we develop a model to derive the matrix elements of the free-fall operator, showing that the variance of the acceleration operator, in addition to its mean, enables estimation of violations of the WEP due to quantum coherence in a way that is robust with respect to shot-to-shot fluctuations. Building on this analysis, we demonstrate how the validity of the WEP may be tested in a torsion balance setup, by accessing the mean and variance of a torque operator we introduce and quantize. Due to the long acquisition times of the signal as compared to the timescale on which coherent superposition states may survive, we further propose a dynamical setting, where the torsion balance is subject to a time-dependent gravitational field, and measurements of angular acceleration encode possible violations of the WEP."}

Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $π$-flux Hubbard model.

While so-called non-Markovian dynamics is common in larger systems with interacting components, observations in fundamental physical systems have been confined to specifically engineered cases. Here, we report the experimental observation of non-Markovian dynamics in an elemental material, crystalline cobalt. By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems."}

We demonstrate that the dispersion of these subgap states depends only on the asymptotic properties of the pair-potential and not on its local spatial variation. Our study reveals the crucial distinction between junctions of non-chiral $p$-wave superconductors and those of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors by analyzing the wavefunction of their subgap bound states. We find a stable topological response leading to the well-known $4π$ periodic Josephson effect protected against weak disorder potential for the non-chiral $p$-wave junctions; no such protection is found for junctions of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors. We supplement our analytic results with numerical computation of the Josephson currents in such junctions using exact numerical Green functions and starting from a lattice model of an itinerant altermagnet which is expected to host triplet $p$-wave superconductivity with equal-spin-pairing.

No internal state is involved in our system, which makes this motional qubit robust to spin-dependent noise.

When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms.

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."}

With the advent of magic state cultivation, preparation qubits can be placed anywhere within the surface code architecture.

While most existing studies focus on Hermitian systems, here we explore boundary critical phenomena in a non-Hermitian quantum 5-state Potts model which exhibits complex conformality in the bulk. We identify free, fixed and mixed conformal boundary conditions and observe the conformal tower structure of energy spectra, supporting the emergence of conformal boundary criticality. We also studied the duality relation between different conformal boundary conditions under the Kramers-Wannier transformation. These findings should facilitate a comprehensive understanding for complex CFTs and stimulate further exploration on the boundary critical phenomena within non-Hermitian strongly-correlated systems."}

These algorithms typically begin by transforming the original nonlinear ODE into a higher-dimensional linear ODE using a linearization technique, most commonly Carleman linearization. Existing works restrict their analysis to ODEs where the nonlinearities are polynomial functions of the dependent variables, significantly limiting their applicability. In this work we construct an efficient quantum algorithm for solving ODEs with `Fourier' nonlinear terms expressible as $d{\\bf u}/dt = G_0 + G_1 e^{i{\\bf u}}$, where ${\\bf u}$ denotes a vector of $n$ complex variables evolving with $t$, $G_0$ is an $n$-dimensional complex vector, $G_1$ is an $n \\times n$ complex matrix and $e^{i{\\bf u}}$ denotes the vector with entries $\\{e^{iu_j}\\}$. To tackle the Fourier nonlinear term, which is not expressible as a finite sum of polynomials of ${\\bf u}$, our algorithm employs a generalization of the Carleman linearization technique known as Koopman linearization. We also make other methodological advances towards relaxing the stringent dissipativity condition required for efficient solution extraction and towards integrated readout of classical quantities from the solution state. Our results open avenues to the development of efficient quantum algorithms for a significantly wider class of high-dimensional nonlinear ODEs, thereby broadening the scope of their applications."}

Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators."}

At half-filling, the zero-temperature ground state is a commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) with alternating occupied and empty sites. This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems."}

In this paper, we present high quality solutions in noise-free Qiskit simulations of networks with up to twelve locations using a hybrid penalty-free, circuit-model, Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA). Noisy qubits are also simulated. To our knowledge, this is the first successful VQA simulation of a twelve-location TSP on circuit-model devices.

Our formulation scales as $\\mathcal{O}(nlog_2(n))$ qubits, requiring only 29 qubits for twelve locations, compared with over 100 qubits for conventional approaches scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Computational time is further reduced by almost two orders of magnitude through the use of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) gradient estimation and cost-function caching. We also introduce a novel machine-learning model, and benchmark both quantum and classical approaches against a Monte Carlo baseline. The VQA outperforms the classical machine-learning approach, and performs similarly to Monte Carlo for the small networks simulated.

Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware."}

The signal to be protected can be retrieved with a minimal distortion after having been transmitted through a noisy channel. Demonstrated by typical examples of encoding signal on two-level superposition state or Einstein-Podolsky-Rossen state transmitted through random telegraph noise and decoherence noises channel, the mean squared error distortion may be close to $0$ and the fault-tolerant capability could reach $1$ with finite quantum resources.

By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures.

In this work, we report the experimental realization of QCC eliminating the need for coincidence detection, where the GHZ state is constructed by correlating detection events occurring within the coherence time, thereby greatly enhancing the success probability of GHZ-state measurement. Meanwhile, to establish and maintain high-visibility GHZ measurement among three independent users, we developed a three-party phase compensation scheme combined with precise temporal and polarization alignment within a time-bin-phase encoding framework. Furthermore, we designed an efficient pairing strategy to simplify subsequent data processing and enhance processing efficiency. Based on these techniques, we successfully performed QCC experiments over total channel losses of 66.3 dB, corresponding to 331.5 km of commercial fiber (0.2 dB/km), achieving secure key rates of 5.4 bit/s, whereas previous QCC experiments have been limited to 100 km.

This paper proposes a novel successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based Kennedy receiver for uplink NOMA-OQC systems, along with a new approach for power allocation of the coherent states emitted by users. The key idea is to rigorously derive the asymptotic sum-rate of the considered systems, taking into account the impact of atmospheric turbulence, background noise, and lossy photon channel. With the asymptotic sum-rate, we optimize the average number of photons (or powers) of the coherent states emitted by the users. Variable substitution and successive convex approximation (SCA) are employed to convexify and maximize the asymptotic sum-rate iteratively. A new coherent-state power allocation algorithm is developed for a small-to-medium number of users.

Numerical evidence shows that the MIS convergence probability increases significantly as the activation probability p tends to 1, and we characterize how the steps required to reach the absorbing state scale with system size and graph connectivity. Motivated by this behavior, we construct a QCA combining a pure dissipative phase with a constraint-preserving unitary evolution that redistributes probability within this manifold. Tensor Network simulations reveal that repeated dissipative--unitary cycles concentrate population on MIS configurations. We also provide an empirical estimate of how the convergence time scales with graph size, suggesting that QCA dynamics can provide an efficient alternative to adiabatic and variational quantum optimization methods based exclusively on local and translationally invariant rules."}

QCSC leverages quantum computers to perform the classically intractable task of sampling the dominant fermionic configurations from the Hilbert space that have substantial support to a target state, followed by Hamiltonian diagonalization on a classical processor. However, noisy quantum hardware produces erroneous samples upon measurements, making robust and efficient configuration-recovery strategies essential for a scalable QCSC pipeline. Toward this, in this work, we introduce PIGen-SQD, an efficiently designed QCSC workflow that utilizes the capability of generative machine learning (ML) along with physics-informed configuration screening via implicit low-rank tensor decompositions for accurate fermionic state reconstruction. The physics-informed pruning is based on a class of efficient perturbative measures that, in conjunction with hardware samples, provide a substantial overlap with the target state. This distribution induces an anchoring effect on the generative ML models to stochastically explore only the dominant sector of the Hilbert space for effective identification of additional important configurations in a self-consistent manner. Our numerical experiments performed on IBM Heron R2 quantum processors demonstrate this synergistic workflow produces compact, high-fidelity subspaces that substantially reduce diagonalization cost while maintaining chemical accuracy under strong electronic correlations. By embedding classical many body intuitions directly into the generative ML model, PIGen-SQD advances the robustness and scalability of QCSC algorithms, offering a promising pathway toward chemically reliable quantum simulations on utility-scale quantum hardware."}

Supercond", "summary": "As quantum computing processors increase in size, there is growing interest in developing cryogenic electronics to overcome significant challenges to system scaling. Single flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits offer a promising alternative to remote, bulky, and power-hungry room temperature electronics. To meet the need for digital qubit control, readout, and co-processing, SFQ circuits must be adapted to operate at millikelvin temperatures near quantum processors. SEEQC's SFQuClass digital quantum management approach proximally places energy-efficient SFQ (ERSFQ) circuits and qubits in a multi-chip module. This enables extremely low power dissipation, compatible with a typical dilution cryostat's limited cooling power, while maintaining high processing speed and low error rates. We report on systematic testing from 4 K to 10 mK of a comprehensive set of ERSFQ cells, as well as more complex circuits such as programmable counters and demultiplexers used in digital qubit control. We compare the operating margins and error rates of these circuits and find that, at millikelvin, bias margins decrease and the center of the margins (i.e., the optimal bias current value) increases by ~15%, compared to 4.2 K. The margins can be restored by thermal annealing by reducing Josephson junction (JJ) critical current Ic. To provide guidance for how circuit parameters vary from 4.2 K to millikelvin, relevant analog process control monitors (PCMs) were tested in the temperature range of interest. The measured JJ critical current (of the PCM JJ arrays) increases by ~15% when decreasing temperature from 4.2 K to millikelvin, in good agreement with both theory and the empirically measured change in the center of bias margins for the tested digital circuits."}

Here, we present a decoupling mechanism, Hybrid-LG, that suppresses intra-bath dipolar interactions -- thus, fast noise acting on spin qubits- and demonstrate its effectiveness in extending spin coherence through efficient in-house CCE simulations. Specifically, we investigate one of the most widely exploited solid-state quantum platforms: an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond coupled to a large and dense bath of substitutional nitrogen paramagnetic impurities (P1 centers).

Hence, quantum mechanics is guaranteed to have the maximal predictive power only in situations of complete certainty and complete uncertainty about measurement outcomes. I then show that the measurement assumption can be further relaxed without affecting the conclusion on the predictive power of quantum mechanics versus alternative theories.

Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware."}

In this work, we present a consistent formalism which has the traditional state-observable framework integrated with the desirable features of dBBT. We adopt ensemble interpretation for the Schrodinger wave function. Given a Schrodinger wave function, we use its value u at some fixed time (say, t = 0) to define the probability measure |u|sqdx on the system configuration space. On the resulting probability space M0, we introduce a stochastic process xi(t) corresponding to the Heisenberg position operator XH(t) such that, in the Heisenberg state phi corresponding to u, the expectation value of XH(t) equals that of xi(t) in M0. This condition leads to the de Broglie-Bohmguidance equation for the sample paths of the process xi(t) which are, therefore, Bohmian trajectories supposedly representing time-evolutions of individual members of the u-ensemble. Stochastic processes and Bohmian trajectories corresponding to observables with discrete eigenvalues (in particular spin) are treated by extending the configuration space to the spectral space of the commutative algebra obtained by adding appropriate discrete observables to the position observables. Pauli's equation is treated as an example. A straightforward derivation of von Neumann's projection rule employing the Schrodinger - Bohm evolution of individual systems along their Bohmian trajectories is given. Some comments on the potential application of the formalism developed here to quantum mechanics of the universe are included."}

We show that this mechanism naturally gives rise to classical chaotic behavior, most notably sensitivity to initial conditions. Our results provide a concrete physical mechanism for the quantum-classical transition in a chaotic system and demonstrate that essential aspects of quantum measurement-state projection, Born-rule-like selection, and irreversibility-can naturally emerge from intrinsic gain dynamics."}

Such systems can be described by non-Hermitian quantum mechanics (NHQM), where the Hamiltonian includes dissipative terms. Within NHQM, one can also formulate the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Kohn-Sham (KS) methods and, as in the conventional theory, an effective independent-particle picture is employed. The crucial observation of the present work is that even for systems that are not coupled to an environment, in the HF or KS equation a single electron is coupled to a bath of the remaining electrons which can act as an environment, opening up the possibility for the exchange of current density between the one-electron and the remaining N-1 electron system. The corresponding self-consistent states represent a new uncharted space of solutions to the HF and KS equations. We show that the additional solutions can have a physical interpretation and thus extend the range of problems HF and KS can be applied to. If open-system HF and KS calculations are performed, the new class of solutions is always encountered but this has also not been noted previously."}

All-nitride Josephson Junctions (JJs) have attracted substantial attention for their potential to provide enhanced coherence times and enable higher temperature operation. However, their performance is often limited by local variations caused by polymorphism, impurities, and interface quality. This work diagnoses atomic-scale limitations preventing superconducting NbN/AlN/NbN JJs from reaching their full potential. Electrical measurements reveal suppressed critical current density and soft onset of quasiparticle current. However, inverse proportionality between resistance and junction area confirms homogenous barrier thickness. This isolates structural and chemical variations in electrodes and barrier as the source of performance limitation. The observed characteristics are attributed to complex materials problems: NbN polymorphism, phase coexistence, and oxygen impurities. Using advanced microscopy and machine learning integrated approach, nanoscale inclusions of epsilon-Nb2N2 are found to coexist within dominant delta-NbN electrodes. DC performance of JJs may be affected by these defects, leading to unresolved supercurrent and soft transition to normal state. By identifying specific atomic scale defects, tracing its origin to initial film nucleation, and linking to its detrimental electrical signature, this work establishes a material-to-device correlation and provides targeted strategy for phase engineering towards reproducible, high coherence and scalable quantum devices."}

However, spin qubit devices face a key architectural bottleneck: the large physical footprint of readout components relative to qubits prevents a dense layout where all qubits can be measured simultaneously, complicating the implementation of quantum error correction. This challenge is offset by the platform's unique rapid shuttling capability, which can be used to transport qubits to distant readout ports. In this work, we explore the design constraints and capabilities of spin qubits in silicon and propose the SNAQ (Shuttling-capable Narrow Array of spin Qubits) surface code architecture, which relaxes the 1:1 readout-to-qubit assumption by leveraging spin shuttling to time-multiplex ancilla qubit initialization and readout. Our analysis shows that, given sufficiently high (experimentally demonstrated) qubit coherence times, SNAQ delivers an orders-of-magnitude reduction in chip area per logical qubit. Additionally, by using a denser grid of physical qubits, SNAQ enables fast transversal logic for short-distance logical operations, achieving 4.0-22.3x improvement in local logical clock speed while still supporting global operations via lattice surgery. This translates to a 57-60% reduction in spacetime cost of 15-to-1 magic state distillation, a key fault-tolerant subroutine.

More general noise, including coherent errors, may have more severe impact on circuit performance than Pauli noise; yet, such general noise have been difficult to access, much less investigate fully, in numerical simulations. Here, through the use of stratified importance sampling, we show how general noise can be simulated within the stabilizer formalism in reasonable time, with non-unitary noise being nearly as cheap as Pauli noise. Unitary (or coherent) noise can require an order of magnitude more time for the simulation, but nevertheless completes in very reasonable times, a drastic improvement over past approaches that typically fail to converge altogether. Our work thus enables detailed beyond-Pauli understanding of circuit performance in the presence of real device noise, which is rarely Pauli in nature. Among other examples, we present direct simulation results for the performance of the popular rotated planar surface codes under circuit-level general noise, previously available only in limited situations and/or through mappings to efficiently simulatable physical models."}

We validate the fidelity by simulating the 53-qubit, 14-cycle Sycamore circuit and achieving a linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) score of 0.549, exceeding the published XEB score of 0.002 from Google's reference data. We then evaluate execution time performance with the more complex 53-qubit, 20-cycle circuit, completing the full 2.5 million-shot workload over 100 CPU jobs in 01:15:36, representing a 6.95 x 10^7 speedup compared to Google's original classical estimate.

The optical field is split by a 90$^\\circ$ optical hybrid and measured by two balanced photodiodes to obtain both quadratures of the vacuum state simultaneously. The analog outputs are digitized using a dual-channel 12-bit analog-to-digital converter operating at a sampling rate of 3.2 GS/s per channel, and processed in real time by an FPGA implementing Toeplitz hashing for randomness extraction. The quantum-to-classical noise ratio was verified through calibrated power spectral density measurements and cross-checked in the time domain, confirming vacuum-noise dominance within the 1.6 GHz detection bandwidth.

By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems."}

The presence of photons in the resonator triggers the frequency conversion of photons. The scattering spectra and the conversion contrast are studied in both the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The disappearance of frequency conversion is rooted in the complete suppression of the emission from the excited state to either of lower states in the $n+1$ subspace where $n$ is the photon number of the resonator, and the non-Markovicity-induced nonreciprocity is found under specific conditions.

The present paper reviews, clarifies, and critically examines two apparently conflicting theorems by Cotler et al. and Stoica. We resolve the tension, show how the former has been widely misinterpreted and why the latter is correct only in some weaker version.

A significant challenge is translating application-level requests into the concrete instructions executable at lower layers.

In classical star networks, such mediated coupling gives rise to remote synchronization--where nonadjacent leaf nodes synchronize through a nonsynchronous hub--and to explosive synchronization, characterized by an abrupt collective transition to coherence. In the quantum regime, analogous effects can arise from the interplay between 1:1 phase locking and 2:1 phase-locking blockade in coupled spin-1 oscillators. In this work, we investigate a star network composed of spin-1 oscillators. For identical oscillators, symmetric and asymmetric dissipation lead to distinct transmission behaviors: remote synchronization and quasi-explosive synchronization appear in different coupling regimes, a phenomenon absent in classical counterparts. For nonidentical networks, we find that at large detuning remote synchronization emerges in the weak-coupling regime and evolves into quasi-explosive synchronization as the coupling increases, consistent with classical star-network dynamics. These findings reveal the rich dynamical characteristics of mediated quantum synchronization and point toward new possibilities for exploring synchronization transmission in larger and more complex quantum systems."}

The first requirement guarantees an exponentially accelerating convergence to the steady state, while the second implies that a quantum system initially farther from equilibrium approaches it more rapidly than an initial state closer to it. This protocol provides a genuine Mpemba effect, and its numerical simulation requires low computational effort. We prove that, for any initial state, there always exists a permutation matrix that maximizes its distance from the equilibrium for a given information-theoretic distinguishability measure. We illustrate our findings for the nonunitary dynamics of the transverse field Ising chain and XXZ chain, each weakly coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, showing the quantum Mpemba effect captured by the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, quantum relative entropy, and trace distance.

Quantum expectation values are usually calculated via Hilbert space inner products and, thereby, differently from expectation values in classical mechanics, which are weighted phase-space integrals. It is shown that, by using Anti-Wick quantization to associate dynamical variables with self-adjoint linear operators, quantum expectation values can be interpreted as genuine weighted averages over phase space, paralleling their classical counterparts. This interpretation arises naturally in the Segal-Bargmann space, where creation and annihilation operators act as simple multiplication and differentiation operators. In this setting, the Husimi Q-function - the coherent-state representation of the quantum state - can be seen as a true probability density in phase space. Unlike Bohmian mechanics, the present approach retains the standard correspondence between dynamical variables and self-adjoint operators while paving the way for a classical-like probabilistic interpretation of quantum statistics."}

The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering.

Our protocol prepares a non-Gaussian cavity state in the dispersive regime of cavity QED and subsequently transfers it to a mechanical oscillator using the optomechanical interaction enhanced by a coherent cavity drive. While non-Gaussian cavity state control in cavity QED is well established in the dispersive regime, its behavior under strong cavity drive, essential for cavity optomechanics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we develop an efficient simulation framework to model cavity QED dynamics in the high-photon-number regime. We show that a strong cavity drive can coherently displace the cavity state with minimal perturbations, effectively decoupling it from the qubit. The resulting large coherent cavity field enhances the optomechanical coupling strength, enabling high-fidelity transfer of non-Gaussian cavity states to the mechanical mode. These results reveal new dynamical features of driven cavity QED and open a pathway toward realizing non-Gaussian mechanical quantum memories and sensors."}

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution to improve readout accuracy . Prior hardware implementations of DNN-based readout are resource-intensive and suffer from high inference latency, limiting their practical use in low-latency decoding and quantum error correction (QEC) loops. This paper proposes LUNA, a fast and efficient superconducting qubit readout accelerator that combines low-cost integrator-based preprocessing with Look-Up Table (LUT) based neural networks for classification. The architecture uses simple integrators for dimensionality reduction with minimal hardware overhead, and employs LogicNets (DNNs synthesized into LUT logic) to drastically reduce resource usage while enabling ultra-low-latency inference. We integrate this with a differential evolution based exploration and optimization framework to identify high-quality design points. Our results show up to a 10.95x reduction in area and 30% lower latency with little to no loss in fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art. LUNA enables scalable, low-footprint, and high-speed qubit readout, supporting the development of larger and more reliable quantum computing systems."}

The first enables shot-by-shot updates to device parameters using measurement outcomes from simple, indefinite-outcome quantum circuits. This low-latency approach supports rapid tuning of one or more parameters in real time to mitigate drift. The second protocol updates parameters after collecting measurements from definite-outcome circuits (e.g.~syndrome extraction circuits for quantum error correction), balancing efficiency with classical control overheads. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate that both methods can calibrate 1- and 2-qubit gates rapidly and accurately even in the presence of decoherence, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and parameter drift. We propose and demonstrate effective adaptive strategies for tuning the hyperparameters of both protocols. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of real-time in-situ calibration of qubits performing quantum error correction, using only syndrome data, via numerical simulations of syndrome extraction in the [[5,1,3]] code."}

The action of a quantum channel usually introduces noise in the quantum state and thereby reduces the information contained in it. Concatenating a quantum channel with another quantum channel makes it more noisy and degrades its information and resource preservability. These are mathematically described by completely positive trace-preserving linear maps that represent the generic evolution of quantum systems. These are special cases of Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. In this work, we demonstrate a physically meaningful way to compare a pair of quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. More precisely, given a pair of quantum channels and an arbitrary unknown input state, we show that if the output state of one quantum channel from the pair can be obtained from the output statistics of the other channel from the pair using some quantum measurement, then the latter channel from the pair can be obtained from the former channel by concatenating it with a Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear map. This relation between these two channels is a preorder, and we try to study its characterization in this work. We also illustrate the implications of our results for the incompatibility of quantum devices through an example."}

Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability. Here, we demonstrate microwave vector magnetometry using the photoexcited spin triplet of pentacene molecules, operating at zero external magnetic field and room temperature. We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in deuterated naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of approximately $1~μ\\mathrm{T}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing in addition to demonstrating control techniques broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems."}

However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators."}

These objects are discontinuities of the spin chain protected by the properties of the global system leading to a quantum many-body multiplet protected from the environment decoherence. Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the homogeneous broadening is governed by the intra-chain dipolar field, and we establish design principles for optimizing coherence in future materials."}

In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators."}

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."}
