A single tunable gap,\n$\\hbar|\\omega_{eff}|$ with $\\omega_{eff}=\\omega_{c}+\\omega_{cl}$, organizes all\nequilibrium observables obtained from a compact harmonic-oscillator partition\nfunction: free energy, internal energy, entropy, heat capacity, magnetization,\nmagnetic susceptibility, and magnetocaloric responses collapse onto universal\nhyperbolic kernels in $x=\\hbar|\\omega_{eff}|/(2k_{B}T)$. We identify a\ncompensated-field regime where the transverse gap closes and the heat capacity\nreaches an equipartition plateau, providing a sharp signature of magnetoelastic\ninterference. In transport and torque, the same scale rigidly shifts the Hall\nfan and compresses the $1/B$ period of de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations when expressed in $1/B_{eff}$, enabling a phase-unwarping protocol\nthat metrologizes the dislocation density from a single field sweep. In\nmesoscopic samples, boundary corrections to the Landau degeneracy generate\nfinite-size calorimetric oscillations that diagnose the effective magnetic\nlength. Moderate disorder and weak interactions preserve the kernel structure\nwhile smoothing amplitudes. We outline an experimental roadmap combining\non-chip calorimetry, torque magnetometry, and transport, and discuss\ndevice-level opportunities in caloritronics and strain engineering,\nmagnetocaloric microcooling, magnetoelastic heat switching, and dilatometric\ntransduction, where the single scale $\\hbar|\\omega_{eff}|$ enables rational\ndesign and optimization."}
