<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为对量子纠错感兴趣的计算机科学家和数学家提供一个易于理解的入门指南，避免过多数学细节。

Abstract: We give an introduction to the theory of quantum error correction using
stabilizer codes that is geared towards the working computer scientists and
mathematicians with an interest in exploring this area. To this end, we begin
with an introduction to basic quantum computation for the uninitiated. We then
construct several examples of simple error correcting codes without reference
to the underlying mathematical formalism in order to develop the readers
intuition for the structure of a generic code. With this in hand, we then
discuss the more general theory of stabilizer codes and provide the necessary
level of mathematical detail for the non-mathematician. Finally, we give a
brief look at the elegant homological algebra formulation for topological
codes. As a bonus, we give implementations of the codes we mention using
OpenQASM, and we address the more recent approaches to decoding using neural
networks. We do not attempt to give a complete overview of the entire field,
but provide the reader with the level of detail needed to continue in this
direction.

### [2] [Evolution of Entanglement Witness of Dicke State under Noise and Error Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07123)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了四量子比特Dicke态的多体纠缠验证，通过理论推导和实验评估，在IBM量子处理器上实现了纠缠见证的测量，并分析了噪声对纠缠的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多体纠缠态的实验验证对量子信息处理至关重要，纠缠见证是一种广泛使用的检测方法。

Method: 理论推导四量子比特Dicke态的纠缠见证，并在IBM 127量子比特处理器上进行实验验证，同时通过Qiskit Aer模拟器分析噪声影响。

Result: 在ibm_sherbrook和ibm_brisbane处理器上分别测得最大负值$-0.178 \pm 0.009$和$-0.169 \pm 0.002$，证实了多体纠缠。噪声分析展示了不同噪声通道对纠缠的影响。

Conclusion: 实验成功验证了四量子比特Dicke态的多体纠缠，并确定了噪声环境下生成该态所需的热弛豫时间界限。

Abstract: The experimental verification of multipartite entangled states is essential
for advancing quantum information processing. Entanglement witnesses (EWs)
provide a widely used and experimentally accessible approach for detecting
genuinely multipartite entangled states. In this work, we theoretically derive
the entanglement witness for the four-qubit Dicke state and experimentally
evaluate it on two distinct IBM 127-qubit Quantum Processing Units (QPUs),
namely ibm\_sherbrook and ibm\_brisbane. A negative expectation value of the
witness operator serves as a sufficient condition for confirming genuine
multipartite entanglement. We report the maximum (negative) values of the
witness achieved on these QPUs as $-0.178 \pm 0.009$ and $-0.169 \pm 0.002$,
corresponding to two different state preparation protocols. Additionally, we
theoretically investigate the effect of various noise channels on the genuine
entanglement of a four-qubit Dicke state using the Qiskit Aer simulator. We
show the behavior of the EW constructed under the assumption of Markovian and
non-Markovian amplitude damping and depolarizing noises, bit-phase flip noise,
and readout errors. We also investigate the effect of varying thermal
relaxation time on the EW, depicting a bound on the $T_1$ time required for
successful generation of a Dicke State on a superconducting QPU.

### [3] [Magic phase transitions in monitored gaussian fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07179)

Conclusion: 基于魔法的诊断揭示了监测多体动力学中隐藏的复杂性转变，超越了标准纠缠探测的能力。

Abstract: Monitored quantum systems, where unitary dynamics compete with continuous
measurements, exhibit dynamical transitions as the measurement rate is varied.
These reflect abrupt changes in the structure of the evolving wavefunction,
captured by complementary complexity diagnostics that include and go beyond
entanglement aspects. Here, we investigate how monitoring affects magic state
resources, the nonstabilizerness, of Gaussian fermionic systems. Using scalable
Majorana sampling techniques, we track the evolution of stabilizer R\'enyi
entropies in large systems under projective measurements. While the leading
extensive (volume-law) scaling of magic remains robust across all measurement
rates, we uncover a sharp transition in the subleading logarithmic corrections.
This measurement-induced complexity transition, invisible to standard
entanglement probes, highlights the power of magic-based diagnostics in
revealing hidden features of monitored many-body dynamics.

### [4] [Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07187)
*Alexandre Chaduteau,Derek K. K. Lee,Frank Schindler*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了非厄米拓扑分类在多体开放量子系统中的适用性，特别是Lindbladian超算符的绕数与后选择非厄米哈密顿量的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多体系统在损失和增益下的混合态开放量子动力学，避免后选择的高成本，并验证非厄米拓扑效应（如皮肤效应）的普适性。

Method: 通过定义Lindbladian超算符的绕数，系统性地将其与后选择非厄米哈密顿量的绕数关联，分析不同条件下的量化关系。

Result: 证明在无增益（损失）时绕数相等（相反）；在损失和增益共存时，绕数仍量化但可能变号，导致皮肤效应反转。

Conclusion: 后选择会掩盖某些相变，而移除后选择可能从拓扑平凡动力学中诱导皮肤效应。

Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is
usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with
time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better
described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to
pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes.
Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here
investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology
can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a
bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number
of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we
systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal
(opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation
for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian
winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change
sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This
transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect
localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case
where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically
trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.

### [5] [Energy Spectra of Compressed Quantum States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07191)
*Daochen Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子算法通过制备可经典访问的量子态并应用量子相位估计来估计量子系统的基态能量。量子优势取决于态的能量谱，即态与系统哈密顿量本征态的重叠序列。研究表明，任何具有最小期望能量的纠缠压缩量子态，其能量谱最多以能量本征值的平方反比衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 发现能量谱最多以能量本征值的平方反比衰减，解释了Silvester等人的实验结果。

Conclusion: 量子优势的问题简化为哈密顿量本征态的能量和纠缠特性。

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for estimating the ground state energy of a quantum system
often operate by preparing a classically accessible quantum state and then
applying quantum phase estimation. Whether this approach yields quantum
advantage hinges on the state's energy spectrum, that is, the sequence of the
state's overlaps with the energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. For any
entanglement-compressed quantum state with minimal expected energy, it is shown
that its energy spectrum decays at most with the inverse-squared energy
eigenvalues. This explains the main empirical finding of Silvester, Carleo, and
White (Physical Review Letters, 2025) that the energy spectra of matrix product
states do not decay exponentially. It also reduces the question of quantum
advantage to the energy and entanglement profile of the Hamiltonian's
eigenstates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非阿贝尔对称性如何改变传统热力学，特别是在非平衡物理中的应用。

Result: 发现有限尺寸修正通常按系统尺寸的倒数缩放，但在某些情况下可能更大。数值模拟支持这一结论。

Conclusion: 非阿贝尔对称性可能显著影响热力学行为，为量子物理中的非平衡研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a fundamental result in
statistical mechanics. It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a
system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property.
Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To
prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry
property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of
certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS
relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH),
which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation
contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size.
Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed
recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum
many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as
usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we
argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a
Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational
capacity, indirectly support the larger correction. This work helps extend into
nonequilibrium physics the effort, recently of interest across quantum physics,
to identify how non-Abelian symmetries may alter conventional thermodynamics.

Conclusion: 研究扩展了布尔函数谱的理论和量子算法，为密码学和量子计算提供了新的工具和视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we study different cryptographically significant spectra of
Boolean functions, including the Walsh-Hadamard, cross-correlation, and
autocorrelation. The $2^k$-variation by Stanica [IEEE-IT 2016] is considered
here with the formulation for any $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Given this, we present
the most generalized version of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which extends the
standard and previously extended versions, thereby encompassing them as special
cases. Additionally, we generalize the Forrelation formulation by introducing
the $m$-Forrelation and propose various quantum algorithms towards its
estimation. In this regard, we explore different strategies in sampling these
newly defined spectra using the proposed $m$-Forrelation algorithms and present
a comparison of their corresponding success probabilities. Finally, we address
the problem related to affine transformations of generalized bent functions and
discuss quantum algorithms in identifying the shifts between two bent (or
negabent) functions with certain modifications, and compare these with existing
results.

Abstract: Quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) enable information processing beyond
classical limits by exploiting the advantages of classical and quantum optics.
However, simulation of large-scale bosonic lattices remains a significant
challenge due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space required to
describe a quantum network accurately. Consequently, previous theoretical
studies have been limited to small-scale systems, leaving the behaviour of
multimode QONNs largely unexplored. This work presents an efficient
computational framework based on the phase-space positive-P method for
simulating bosonic neuromorphic systems. This approach provides a view to
previously inaccessible regimes, allowing the validation of large-scale bosonic
networks in various quantum machine learning tasks such as quantum state
classification and quantum state feature prediction. Our results show that the
performance of a large quantum reservoir does not improve monotonously with the
number of bosonic modes, instead following a complex dependence driven by the
interplay of nonlinearity, reservoir size, and the average occupation of the
input mode. These findings are essential for designing and optimising optical
bosonic reservoirs for future quantum neuromorphic computing devices.

Result: 提供了一种简单方法，获得了更严格的有限尺寸关键率。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于推动设备无关密码学向商业化迈进。

Abstract: Device-independent (DI) cryptography represents the highest level of
security, enabling cryptographic primitives to be executed safely on
uncharacterized devices. Moreover, with successful proof-of-concept
demonstrations in randomness expansion, randomness amplification, and quantum
key distribution, the field is steadily advancing toward commercial viability.
Critical to this continued progression is the development of tighter
finite-size security proofs. In this work, we provide a simple method to obtain
tighter finite-size security proofs for protocols based on the CHSH game, which
is the nonlocality test used in all of the proof-of-concept experiments. We
achieve this by analytically solving key-rate optimization problems based on
R\'enyi entropies, providing a simple method to obtain tighter finite-size key
rates.

Abstract: Semiclassical approximations for various representations of a quantum state
are constructed on a single (Lagrangian) surface in phase space, but it is not
available for chaotic systems. An analogous evolution surface underlies
semiclassical representations of the evolution operator, albeit in a doubled
phase space. It is here shown that, corresponding to the Fourier transform on a
unitary operator, represented as a Green function or spectral Wigner function,
a Legendre transform generates a resolvent surface as the classical basis for
semiclassical representations of the resolvent operator in double phase space,
independently of the integrable or chaotic nature of the system. This surface
coincides with derivatives of action functions (or generating functions)
depending on the choice of appropriate coordinates and its growth departs from
the energy shell following trajectories in double phase space. In an initial
study of the resolvent surface based on its caustics, its complex nature is
revealed to be analogous to a multidimensional sponge.
  Resummation of the trace of the resolvent in terms of linear combinations of
periodic orbits, known as pseudo orbits or composite orbits, provides a cutoff
to the semiclassical sum at the Heisenberg time. It is here shown that the
corresponding actions for higher times can be approximately included within
true secondary periodic orbits, in which multiple windings of short periodic
orbits are joined by heteroclinic orbits into larger circuits.

Abstract: Quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically
transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. To realize
this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to
effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant
challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited
availability of quantum computer hardware, high computational demands of
simulating quantum computers on classical systems, and complicated technology
stack to enable currently available accelerators into development environments.
These limitations make it difficult for the developer to create an efficient
workflow for quantum software development. In this paper, we investigate the
potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to
improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of
moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote
hardware and offering speedup in execution with simulator surroundings. The
goal is to allow the development of more complex circuits and to support an
iterative software development approach. In our experiment, with the solution
presented in this paper, we have obtained up to 5 times faster circuit
execution runtime, and enabled qubit ranges from 21 to 29 qubits with a simple
plug-and-play kernel for the Jupyter notebook.

Abstract: Quantum battery has become one of the hot issues at the research frontiers of
quantum physics recently. Charging power, extractable work and wireless
charging over long-distance are three important aspects of interest.
Non-contact electromagnetic interaction provides an important avenue for
wireless charging. In this paper, we design a wireless and remote charging
scheme based on the quantized Hamiltonian of two coupled LC circuits, and focus
on the charging dynamics of a continuous variable quantum battery. It is found
that the quantum entanglement, which is regarded as a significant quantum
resource, is not a prerequisite for charging the battery and extracting useful
work. On the contrary, all of the energy in the battery could be converted into
useful work in the absence of the entanglement for our model. The often
overlooked counter-rotating wave coupling in the interacting Hamiltonian is
helpful for extracting more useful work from the charger. If the coupling
between the battery and the charger is designed to contain both the rotating
and counter-rotating wave couplings, the extractable work can be obtained even
if the charger is prepared in thermal states, while such effect cannot be
achieved in the presence of a rotating or counter-rotating wave coupling alone.
Finally, the effect of the system's parameters on the extractable work is
discussed, which will provide a reference for full use of the thermal state
energy.

Result: 量子算法在特征向量维度k和动作空间A的大小上，每次迭代的时间复杂度比经典算法提高了二次方因子。

Conclusion: 量子算法在学徒学习中具有显著的速度优势，为复杂任务的高效训练提供了新途径。

Abstract: Apprenticeship learning is a method commonly used to train artificial
intelligence systems to perform tasks that are challenging to specify directly
using traditional methods. Based on the work of Abbeel and Ng (ICML'04), we
present a quantum algorithm for apprenticeship learning via inverse
reinforcement learning. As an intermediate step, we give a classical
approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm to demonstrate the speedup
obtained by our quantum algorithm. We prove convergence guarantees on our
classical approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm, which also extends to
our quantum apprenticeship learning algorithm. We also show that, as compared
to its classical counterpart, our quantum algorithm achieves an improvement in
the per-iteration time complexity by a quadratic factor in the dimension of the
feature vectors $k$ and the size of the action space $A$.

Conclusion: 本文为α-z相对熵提供了操作解释，扩展了其在量子信息理论中的应用。

Abstract: In this work, we offer the first operational interpretation of the
$\alpha$-$z$ relative entropies, which were introduced by Jak\v{s}i\'{c} {\it
et al.} \cite{Jaksic2012} and Audenaert and Datta \cite{Audenaert_Datta_2015},
where the $\alpha$ and $z$ parameters are truly independent from each other.
Namely, we show that these relative entropies appear in the conditions for
large-sample or catalytic relative majorization of pairs of flat states and
certain generalizations of them. Additionally, the optimal rate of converting
one such pair into another may be formulated in terms of the $\alpha$-$z$
relative entropies.

Motivation: 由于SYK模型的混沌性质，经典数值模拟难以处理其实时动力学，量子模拟成为有吸引力的替代方案。然而，噪声量子处理器上的模拟受限于哈密顿量的复杂性。

Conclusion: 研究表明稀疏化SYK模型和TETRIS算法在量子模拟中具有潜力，并提出了可扩展的镜像电路基准测试方法。

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model describes a strongly correlated quantum
system that shows a strong signature of quantum chaos. Due to its chaotic
nature, the simulation of real-time dynamics becomes quickly intractable by
means of classical numerics, and thus, quantum simulation is deemed to be an
attractive alternative. Nevertheless, quantum simulations of the SYK model on
noisy quantum processors are severely limited by the complexity of its
Hamiltonian. In this work, we simulate the real-time dynamics of a sparsified
version of the SYK model with 24 Majorana fermions on a trapped-ion quantum
processor. We adopt a randomized quantum algorithm, TETRIS, and develop an
error mitigation technique tailored to the algorithm. Leveraging the hardware's
high-fidelity quantum operations and all-to-all connectivity of the qubits, we
successfully calculate the Loschmidt amplitude for sufficiently long times so
that its decay is observed. Based on the experimental and further numerical
results, we assess the future possibility of larger-scale simulations of the
SYK model by estimating the required quantum resources. Moreover, we present a
scalable mirror-circuit benchmark based on the randomized SYK Hamiltonian and
the TETRIS algorithm, which we argue provides a better estimate of the decay of
fidelity for local observables than standard mirror-circuits.

Abstract: We have recently put forth several schemes of unconventional,
nonlinearly-enabled thermodynamic (TD) devices that can operate in either the
classical or the quantum domain by transforming thermal-state input in multiple
uncorrelated modes into non-gaussian state output in selected modes: a
four-mode Kerr-nonlinear interferometer that acts as a heat engine; two coupled
Kerr-nonlinear Mach-Zehnder interferometers that act as a phase microscope with
unprecedented phase resolution; and a noise sensor that can distinguish between
unknown nonlinear quantum processes. These schemes reveal the unique merits of
nonlinear TD devices: their ability to act in an autonomous, fully coherent,
dissipationless fashion, unlike their conventional counterparts. Here we
present the opportunities and challenges facing this new paradigm of nonlinear
(NL) quantum and classical TD devices along the following lines: A) Linear
versus nonlinear multimode transformations in TD devices: what are the
principal distinctions between the two types of transformations? B) Classical
versus quantum effects in NL TD devices: what are their main differences? Is
quantumness an advantage or a disadvantage? C) Deterministic methods of
achieving giant nonlinearity at the few-photon level via coherent processes,
including multiatom-bath interactions which can paradoxically yield NL
Hamiltonian effects: their comparison with probabilistic, measurement-based
methods that can achieve similar NL effects in the quantum domain.

TL;DR: sVQNHE是一种神经引导的变分量子算法，通过分离振幅和相位学习，结合经典神经网络和浅层量子电路，显著降低测量成本并提升优化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决变分量子算法中高测量成本、优化困难等问题，充分利用经典与量子资源的协同作用。

Method: 采用经典神经网络学习振幅分布，浅层量子电路处理相位信息，形成双向反馈循环优化。

Result: 在6-qubit J1-J2模型中，平均绝对误差降低98.9%，方差减少99.6%；在45顶点Erdos-Renyi图的MaxCut问题中，解质量提升19%，量子资源效率提高85%。

Conclusion: sVQNHE为复杂多体和组合优化问题提供了高效解决方案，适合当前和未来的量子计算设备。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold great promise for unlocking the power of
near-term quantum processors, yet high measurement costs, barren plateaus, and
challenging optimization landscapes frequently hinder them. Here, we introduce
sVQNHE, a neural-guided variational quantum algorithm that decouples amplitude
and sign learning across classical and quantum modules, respectively. Our
approach employs shallow quantum circuits composed of commuting diagonal gates
to efficiently model quantum phase information, while a classical neural
network learns the amplitude distribution and guides circuit optimization in a
bidirectional feedback loop. This hybrid quantum-classical synergy not only
reduces measurement costs but also achieves high expressivity with limited
quantum resources and improves the convergence rate of the variational
optimization. We demonstrate the advancements brought by sVQNHE through
extensive numerical experiments. For the 6-qubit J1-J2 model, a prototypical
system with a severe sign problem for Monte Carlo-based methods, it reduces the
mean absolute error by 98.9% and suppresses variance by 99.6% relative to a
baseline neural network, while requiring nearly 19x fewer optimization steps
than a standard hardware-efficient VQE. Furthermore, for MaxCut problems on
45-vertex Erdos-Renyi graphs, sVQNHE improves solution quality by 19% and
quantum resource efficiency by 85%. Importantly, this framework is designed to
be scalable and robust against hardware noise and finite-sampling uncertainty,
making it well-suited for both current NISQ processors and future high-quality
quantum computers. Our results highlight a promising path forward for
efficiently tackling complex many-body and combinatorial optimization problems
by fully exploiting the synergy between classical and quantum resources in the
NISQ era and beyond.

Abstract: At the interception between quantum computing and machine learning, Quantum
Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising research field. Due to
its novelty, a standardized and comprehensive collection for QRL algorithms has
not yet been established. Researchers rely on numerous software stacks for
classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) as well as on various quantum computing

algorithms. Inspired by the CleanRL library for classical RL algorithms, we
present CleanQRL, a library that offers single-script implementations of many
QRL algorithms. Our library provides clear and easy to understand scripts that
researchers can quickly adapt to their own needs. Alongside ray tune for
distributed computing and streamlined hyperparameter tuning, CleanQRL uses
weights&biases to log important metrics, which facilitates benchmarking against
other classical and quantum implementations. The CleanQRL library enables
researchers to easily transition from theoretical considerations to practical

Abstract: We initiate the study of online quantum state tomography (QST), where the
matrix representation of an unknown quantum state is reconstructed by
sequentially performing a batch of measurements and updating the state estimate
using only the measurement statistics from the current round. Motivated by
recent advances in non-convex optimization algorithms for solving low-rank QST,
we propose non-convex mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms
to tackle online QST, which leverage the low-rank structure of the unknown
quantum state and are well-suited for practical applications. Our main
technical contribution is a rigorous convergence analysis of these algorithms.
With proper initialization, we demonstrate that the SGD algorithms for online
low-rank QST achieve linear convergence both in expectation and with high
probability. Our algorithms achieve nearly optimal sample complexity while
remaining highly memory-efficient. In particular, their time complexities are
better than the state-of-the-art non-convex QST algorithms, in terms of the
rank and the logarithm of the dimension of the unknown quantum state.

Abstract: Computing the excitation spectra of quantum many-body systems on noisy
quantum devices is a promising avenue to demonstrate the practical utility of
current quantum processors, especially as we move toward the ``megaquop''
regime. For this task, here we introduce a \textit{tangent-space excitation
ansatz} for quantum circuits, motivated by the quasi-particle picture of
many-body systems and the structural similarity between quantum circuits and
classical tensor networks. Increasing the circuit depth by one layer to
construct the tangent space around the variational optimum of a parametrized
quantum circuit, we show that a large number of low-energy states can be
accurately captured. We demonstrate this ansatz using various models in both
one and two spatial dimensions, including the challenging kagome Heisenberg
antiferromagnet. We further provide evidence that this approach, implementable
using Hadamard test, is stable in the presence of measurement noise and
scalable to large system size.

Abstract: Hybrid solvers for combinatorial optimization problems combine the advantages
of classical and quantum computing to overcome difficult computational
challenges. Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their
practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack
that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical
optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ
toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure
hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements
decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum
subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such
decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines
well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that
are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the
technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and
demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof
of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of
quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to
make their performance competitive.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进VQE的方法，通过优化1-RDM以提高能量和分子性质的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQE仅优化能量，而1-RDM的可靠性对分子性质至关重要，因此需要同时优化能量和1-RDM。

Method: 采用两步算法：第一步优化能量，第二步在成本函数中加入惩罚项以优化1-RDM。

Result: 实验表明，优化1-RDM显著提升了电子密度、偶极矩等性质的准确性，同时改善了能量精度。

Conclusion: 同时优化能量和1-RDM是提高变分量子算法准确性的有效策略。

Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising method for
simulating molecular systems on near-term quantum computers. This approach
employs energy estimation; however, other relevant molecular properties can be
extracted from the one-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) generated by
VQE. The accuracy of these properties strongly depends on the reliability and
convergence of the 1-RDM, which is not guaranteed by energy-only optimization.
Thus, we investigate the effect of optimizing the 1-RDM within VQE to improve
the accuracy of both the energy and molecular properties. A two-step algorithm
was implemented that optimizes the energy and 1-RDM by incorporating a penalty
term in the cost function to enforce the convergence of the 1-RDM. The first
step focuses on energy minimization, while in the second step, a weighted
penalty is added to the cost function to promote simultaneous improvement of
the energy and 1-RDM. This approach was tested and validated for the k-UpCCGSD
and GateFabric ans\"atzes with active spaces (4,4) and (2,2), respectively.
k-UpCCGSD produces energies close to CISD, so optimizing 1-RDM has little
effect on the energy but significantly improves electronic properties such as
electron density, dipole moments, and atomic charges. GateFabric initially
shows higher energy deviations from CISD, but optimizing 1-RDM substantially
improves both the energy accuracy and the quality of 1-RDM. These results
demonstrate that simultaneous optimization of energy and 1-RDM is an effective
strategy to improve the accuracy of energies and molecular properties in
variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: We consider a three-mode electro-optomechanical system in which a mechanical
oscillator is coupled to an optical cavity and a LC circuit through radiation
pressure and capacitive coupling, respectively. By controlling the two-tone
driving of the optical cavity and the microwave driving of the LC circuit, the
strong squeezing of both the microwave field of the LC circuit and the
mechanical mode will be obtained. Moreover, by further altering the driving
power of the system, the perfect one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering
between the optical cavity and the mechanical oscillator will be generated. The
degree of the one-way EPR steering can be controlled by the driving light of
the system. We also show the robustness of the squeezing and EPR steering
against environmental temperature. This scheme may provide a promising platform
for quantum information processing and microwave quantum communication.

Abstract: We present a detailed simulation and design framework for realizing traveling

These kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs) operate via three-wave mixing (3WM) to
achieve high broadband gain and near-quantum-limited (nQL) noise.
Representative fabricated devices -- realized using an inverted microstrip
(IMS), dispersion-engineered, artificial transmission line -- demonstrate power
gains above 25 dB, bandwidths beyond 3 GHz, and achieve ultimate system noise
levels of 1.1 quanta even when operated with no magnetic shielding. These
performance metrics are competitive with state-of-the-art
Josephson-junction-based TWPAs but involve simpler fabrication and able to
providing three orders of magnitude higher dynamic range ($IIP_1 = -68$ dBm,
$IIP_3 = -55$ dBm), and high magnetic field resilience -- making KITs an
attractive technology for highly multiplexed readout of quantum information and
superconducting detector systems.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are pivotal components of variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs), which represent a promising pathway to quantum
advantage in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. PQCs enable
flexible encoding of quantum information through tunable quantum gates and have
been successfully applied across domains such as quantum chemistry,
combinatorial optimization, and quantum machine learning. Despite their
potential, PQC performance on NISQ hardware is hindered by noise, decoherence,
and the presence of barren plateaus, which can impede gradient-based
optimization. To address these limitations, we propose novel methods for
improving gradient-free optimizers Rotosolve, Fraxis, and FQS, incorporating
information from previous parameter iterations. Our approach conserves
computational resources by reallocating optimization efforts toward poorly
optimized gates, leading to improved convergence. The experimental results
demonstrate that our techniques consistently improve the performance of various
optimizers, contributing to more robust and efficient PQC optimization.

Abstract: Violation of local realism via Bell inequality - a profound and
counterintuitive manifestation of quantum theory that conflicts with the
prediction of local realism - is viewed to be intimately linked with quantum
entanglement. Experimental demonstrations of such a phenomenon using quantum
entangled states are among the landmark experiments of modern physics and paved
the way for quantum technology. Here we report the violation of the Bell
inequality that cannot be described by quantum entanglement in the system but
arises from quantum indistinguishability by path identity, shown by the
multi-photon frustrated interference. By analyzing the measurement of
four-photon frustrated interference within the standard Bell-test formalism, we
find a violation of Bell inequality by more than four standard deviations. Our
work establishes a connection between quantum correlation and quantum
indistinguishability, providing insights into the fundamental origin of the
counterintuitive characteristics observed in quantum physics.

Abstract: We present a quantum optimal control protocol to generate highly
spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays coupled via Ising-type Van der
Waals interactions. Using gradient-based optimization techniques we construct
time-dependent pulse sequences that steer an initial product state toward
highly entangled, spin-squeezed states with predefined magnetization and
squeezing axes. We focus on the Wineland parameter $\xi_W^2$ to measure spin
squeezing and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in
one-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, generating states with
entanglement depths exceeding 6, and significantly outperforming conventional
quench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse
sequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional
optimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in
systems containing $N=50$ spins. This work demonstrates the potential of
quantum optimal control methods for preparing highly spin-squeezed states,
opening pathways to enhanced quantum metrology.

Conclusion: 新技术显著减少了块编码的辅助位开销，为量子算法资源优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Block encodings are a fundamental primitive in quantum algorithms, but can
often have large ancilla overhead. In this work, we introduce novel techniques
for reducing this overhead in two distinct ways. In Part I, we prove the
existence of a "space-time tradeoff" by deriving an algorithm that, for any
block encoding, approximately uncomputes all but one of its ancilla (freeing up
those ancillae for reuse in later parts of a quantum algorithm). In Part II, we
evaluate the minimum number of ancillae required to perform coherent
multiplication of block encodings. We prove that logarithmic ancillae is
optimal for exact multiplication of block encodings. However, in certain block
encoding regimes, we show that approximate multiplication of block encodings
can be achieved to high-precision with just one ancilla.

Abstract: We present two protocols, with one and two two-qubit gates, to noninvasively
measure two incompatible observables on a qubit. Both protocols are completed

The detailed analysis of the data on 10 qubit sets from 5 devices available on

almost all cases. The noninvasiveness is supported by a qualitative and
quantitative agreement with the model of weak disturbance. These results show

Abstract: We revisit the problem of fitting Lindbladian models to the outputs of
quantum process tomography. A sequence of prior theoretical works approached
the problem by considering whether there exists a Lindbladian generator close
to a matrix logarithm of the tomographically estimated transfer matrix. This
technique must take into account the non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm, so
that in general multiple branches of the logarithm must be checked. In
contrast, all practical demonstrations of Lindbladian fitting on real
experimental data have to our knowledge eschewed logarithm search, instead
adopting direct numerical optimisation or ad-hoc approaches tailored to a
particular experimental realisation. In our work, we introduce algorithmic
improvements to logarithm search, demonstrating that it can be applied in
practice to settings relevant for current quantum computing hardware. We
additionally augment the task of Lindbladian fitting with techniques from gate
set tomography to improve robustness against state preparation and measurement
(SPAM) errors, which can otherwise obfuscate estimates of the model underlying
the process of interest. We benchmark our techniques extensively using
simulated tomographic data employing a range of realistic error models, before
demonstrating their application to tomographic data collected from real
superconducting-qubit hardware.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决量子子系统与环境交互导致的退相干问题，通过主动控制部分子系统实现噪声隔离。

Method: 结合分析和数值工具，找到近似的无退相干子空间（DFS），并通过控制墙子系统实现状态稳定化。

Result: 该方法显著提升了选择性或完全动态解耦（DD）的性能，并在特定条件下实现系统纯度的永恒保持。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子信息保护提供了一种简化且高效的解决方案，适用于与其他保护技术（如DD）的集成。

Abstract: The present work analyzes state-stabilization techniques for decoupling a
subsystem from environmental interactions. The proposed framework uses
analytical and numerical tools to find an approximate decoherence-free subspace
(DFS) with enhanced passive noise isolation. Active state-stabilizing control
on a subsystem mediating dominant environmental interactions, which we call
wall subsystem, creates an effective quantum wall state. The proposed method
controls only the wall subsystem, leaving the logical subsystem untouched. This
simplifies logic operations in the protected subsystem, and makes it suitable
for integration with other quantum information protection techniques, such as
dynamical decoupling (DD). We demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing the
performance of selective or complete DD. Under suitable conditions, our method
maintains system purity above a threshold for all times, achieving eternal
purity preservation. Theoretical analysis links this behavior to the asymptotic
spectrum of the Hamiltonian when the control gain grows unbounded.

applications, we sharpen the one-shot achievability bound on the relative
entropy error in a wealth of quantum covering-type problems, such as soft
covering, privacy amplification, convex splitting, quantum information
decoupling, and quantum channel simulation by removing some dimension-dependent
factors. Moreover, the established one-shot bounds extend to
infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces as well. The proof techniques are
based on the recently developed operator layer cake theorem and an operator
change-of-variable argument, which are of independent interest.

Motivation: 扩展Mosonyi和Ogawa（2015）及Mosonyi和Hiai（2023）的结果，验证夹层Rényi熵在量子信息中的普适性。

Result: 证明夹层Rényi熵的操作意义不仅限于矩阵，而是量子信息的基本属性。

Conclusion: 推广到一般冯·诺依曼代数为随机矩阵理论和基础物理的量子信息理论提供了新联系。

Abstract: We extend from the hyperfinite setting to general von Neumann algebras
Mosonyi and Ogawa's (2015) and Mosonyi and Hiai's (2023) results showing the
operational interpretation of sandwiched relative R\'enyi entropy in the strong
converse of hypothesis testing. The specific task is to distinguish between two
quantum states given many copies. We use a reduction method of Haagerup, Junge,
and Xu (2010) to approximate relative entropy inequalities in an arbitrary von
Neumann algebra by those in finite von Neumann algebras. Within these finite
von Neumann algebras, it is possible to approximate densities via finite
spectrum operators, after which the quantum method of types reduces them to
effectively commuting subalgebras. Generalizing beyond the hyperfinite setting
shows that the operational meaning of sandwiched R\'enyi entropy is not
restricted to the matrices but is a more fundamental property of quantum
information. Furthermore, applicability in general von Neumann algebras opens
potential new connections to random matrix theory and the quantum information
theory of fundamental physics.

Result: 发现了一种新的动态因果顺序类型，并形式化了量子过程中因果顺序的模糊性和动态性。

Conclusion: 论文扩展了对动态因果顺序的理解，为量子过程的研究提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Requiring that the causal structure between different parties is well-defined
imposes constraints on the correlations they can establish, which define
so-called causal correlations. Some of these are known to have a "dynamical"
causal order in the sense that their causal structure is not fixed a priori but
is instead established on the fly, with for instance the causal order between
future parties depending on some choice of action of parties in the past. Here
we identify a new way that the causal order between the parties can be
dynamical: with at least four parties, there can be some dynamical order which
can nevertheless not be influenced by the actions of past parties. This leads
us to introduce an intermediate class of correlations with what we call
non-influenceable causal order, in between the set of correlations with static
(non-dynamical) causal order and the set of general causal correlations. We
then define analogous classes of quantum processes, considering recently
introduced classes of quantum circuits with classical or quantum control of
causal order - the latter being the largest class within the process matrix
formalism known to have a clear interpretation in terms of coherent
superpositions of causal orders. This allows us to formalise precisely in which
sense certain quantum processes can have both indefinite and dynamical causal
order.

Conclusion: VNA在投资组合优化中具有高效性和普适性，展现了多项式退火时间缩放行为。

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a routine asset management operation conducted in
financial institutions around the world. However, under real-world constraints
such as turnover limits and transaction costs, its formulation becomes a
mixed-integer nonlinear program that current mixed-integer optimizers often
struggle to solve. We propose mapping this problem onto a classical Ising-like
Hamiltonian and solving it with Variational Neural Annealing (VNA), via its
classical formulation implemented using autoregressive neural networks. We
demonstrate that VNA can identify near-optimal solutions for portfolios
comprising more than 2,000 assets and yields performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Mosek, while exhibiting faster convergence
on hard instances. Finally, we present a dynamical finite-size scaling analysis
applied to the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 3000 indices, revealing
universal behavior and polynomial annealing time scaling of the VNA algorithm
on portfolio optimization problems.

Conclusion: 改进的腔方法成功解决了局域化特征向量情况下的顶部特征值检测问题。

Abstract: The detection of the top eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector in
ensembles of random matrices has significant applications across various
fields. An existing method, based on the linear stability of a complementary
set of cavity equations, has been successful in identifying the top eigenvalue
when the associated eigenvector is extended. However, this approach fails when
the eigenvector is localized. In this work, we adapt the real-valued cavity
method to address this limitation by introducing a novel criterion that
exploits the constraints of the cavity equations to detect the top eigenvalue
in systems with a localized top eigenvector. Our results are validated using
the Anderson model as a paradigmatic example.

Conclusion: PAOA提供了一种有原则的变分框架，自然扩展了模拟退火，优化多温度分布，性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends
and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling
parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic
computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of
binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples.
We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the
gradient of the full $2^N \times 2^N$ Markov flow, showing that PAOA admits a
principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting
case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an
FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D
spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior
performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing
by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance
over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-L\'evy.

Abstract: One of the theoretical pillars that sustain certain machine learning models
are universal approximation theorems, which prove that they can approximate all
functions from a function class to arbitrary precision. Independently,
classical spin models are termed universal if they can reproduce the behavior
of any other spin model in their low energy sector. Universal spin models have
been characterized via sufficient and necessary conditions, showing that simple
models such as the 2d Ising with fields are universal. In this work, we prove
that universal spin models are universal approximators of probability
distributions. As a consequence, the characterization of the former gives rise
to universal approximation theorems for the latter. This allows us to derive
new proofs of universal approximation theorems for restricted and deep
Boltzmann machines, as well as deep belief networks. This work illustrates that
independently discovered universality statements may be intimately related,
enabling the transfer of results.

Method: 使用p-bit网络（二进制随机神经元）进行状态更新，通过ASIC实现测量能量成本，并在生成AI中用p-bit替代传统神经元。

Result: 能量成本是重要指标，少量样本平均可恢复生成AI的图像质量。

Conclusion: p-bit网络在概率分布生成和生成AI中具有潜力，能量成本是关键优化方向。

Abstract: A p-circuit comprising a network of $N$ p-bits can generate samples from a
probability distribution with $2^N$ possibilities just like a network of
q-bits, though there are interesting fundamental differences. A p-bit is
essentially a binary stochastic neuron used in Boltzmann machines which involve
the repeated application of a specific elementary operation, whereby each p-bit
looks at the state of 'n' other p-bits, computes the probability for being $0$
or $1$, and chooses its next state accordingly. We argue that the energy cost,
$\epsilon(n)$, of this elementary operation is an important metric and we use
our ASIC to extract it for our implementation, to serve as model and benchmark
for other implementations. We further argue that the same elementary operation
can be used in generative AI replacing the standard continuous or multi-bit
digital neurons with p-bits. It might appear that this would introduce
significant errors, but we show that by averaging a small number (say $1 \ to \
100$) samples, the image quality can be restored.

Abstract: Broken-symmetry-induced order parameters account for many phenomena in
condensed matter physics. For spin glasses, such a framework dictates its
theoretical construction, whereas experiments have only established dynamical
behaviors such as frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility and aging but not
the thermodynamic phase. Experimental techniques have limitations when the spin
glass is probed as an isolated state. To resolve this conundrum, we create an
evolution from long-range order using a well-controlled tuning of the disorder
on a spinel's sublattice. Cross-referencing a series of specimens at both long
(milliseconds to seconds) and short (picosecond) time scales illustrates the
relationship between spin glass and long- and short-range orders. The dynamics
of short- and long-range order formations are not affected by disorder, as
revealed by neutron magnetic diffuse scattering, however the ranges of these
orderings are changed by the introduced disorder. Across all specimens, the
inflection point of the correlation length's temperature dependence fully
matches with the peak in heat capacity, while spin glass can freeze either
below or well above this characteristic temperature of spin order formation.
Our results identify an uncorrelated coexistence of the two and attribute
components of the spin glass to individual spins at domain walls between spin
clusters.

Abstract: Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected
decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural
networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners
can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal
learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay
between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search
for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the
learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to
interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine
statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to
identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the
high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations
that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order
parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control
problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of
minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework
encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and
control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal
curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising
autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how
optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing
alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting.
Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results
establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal
learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded
in statistical physics.

Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain
of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a
progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred
numerous developments in diverse branches of physics. The literature is silent,
however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of
this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here,
supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral
equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this
analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless
formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the
localization length.

Abstract: Quantum simulations of vestigial orders in multi-orbital superfluids have
been attracting continuous research interests in both cold atoms and condensed
matter systems, as it provides valuable insights into the high-temperature
superconductivity. Here, we experimentally investigate thermal phase
transitions in a Floquet-engineered double-valley bandstructure realized with
ultracold bosonic atoms in a shaken optical lattice. The system exhibits both
U(1) and time-reversal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and in the ground state, it
forms a chiral superfluid with the Bose-Einstein condensation at a single
valley.By tuning the temperature, we observe a vestigial order melting of the
chiral superfluid: first into a paramagnetic superfluid, and then into a normal
phase. We measure the superfluid and Ising transition temperatures across a
range of driving frequencies, and find that the critical temperature of the
superfluid transition is always higher than that of Ising transition within the
studied frequency range. As the frequency approaches the resonance, the Ising
transition temperature decreases, while the superfluid transition temperature
remains almost unaffected. The two phase transitions merge into a single
transition at far detuning. Our experimental results imply rich quantum
many-body physics as an interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in
periodically driven quantum systems.

Abstract: Quench spectroscopy has emerged as a novel and powerful technique for probing
the energy spectrum of various quantum phases for quantum systems from
out-of-equilibrium dynamics. While its efficacy has been demonstrated in the
homogeneous systems theoretically, most experimental setups feature a confining
potential, such as a harmonic trap, which complicates the practical
implementations. In this work, we experimentally probe the quench spectroscopy
for one-dimensional bosons in optical lattices with the presence of a harmonic
trap, and comparing our results with the density matrix renormalization group
simulation. For the Mott insulator phase, although a gap is still observed, the
band signal is broadened along the frequency space and cut at the half
Brillouin zone, which can be explained by the excitations under harmonic
confinement. Comparing with the superfluid spectrum, we can see a clear
distinction between the two phases and find the inverse quench with larger
amplitude yields the clearest spectrum. Our work offers pivotal insights into
conducting quench spectroscopy effectively in practical systems.

Abstract: The Hepp-Lieb-Dicke model is ubiquitous in cavity quantum electrodynamics,
describing spin-cavity coupling which does not conserve excitation number.
Coupling the closed spin-cavity system to an environment realizes the open
Dicke model, and by tuning the structure of the environment or the
system-environment coupling, interesting spin-only models can be engineered. In
this work, we focus on a variation of the multi-species open Dicke model which
realizes mediated nonreciprocal interactions between the spin species and,
consequently, an interesting dynamical limit-cycle phase. In particular, we
improve upon adiabatic elimination and, instead, employ a Redfield master
equation in order to describe the effective dynamics of the spin-only system.
We assess this approach at the mean-field level, comparing it both to adiabatic
elimination and the full spin-cavity model, and find that the predictions are
sensitive to the presence of single-particle incoherent decay. Additionally, we
clarify the symmetries of the model and explore the dynamical limit-cycle phase
in the case of explicit parity-time-symmetry breaking, finding a region of
phase coexistence terminating at an codimension-two exceptional point. Lastly,
we go beyond mean-field theory by exact numerical diagonalization of the master
equation, appealing to permutation symmetry in order to increase the size of
accessible systems. We find signatures of phase transitions even for small
system sizes.

Abstract: Critical phenomena at finite temperature underpin a broad range of physical
systems, yet their study remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks
near phase transitions. Quantum annealers have attracted significant interest
as a potential tool for accessing finite temperature criticality beyond
classical reach, but their utility in precisely resolving criticality has
remained limited by noise, hardware constraints, and thermal fluctuations. Here
we overcome these challenges, showing that careful calibration and embedding
allow quantum annealers to capture the full finite-temperature critical
behavior of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. By tuning the
energy scale of the system and mitigating device asymmetries, we sample
effective Boltzmann distributions and extract both the critical temperature and
the associated critical exponents. Our approach opens the study of equilibrium
and non-equilibrium critical phenomena in a broad class of systems at finite

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨混沌与热化时间的不同关系，揭示两种不同的动力学行为。

Method: 通过数值和解析方法研究了两种扰动可积经典自旋模型：Ishimori自旋链（受限混沌）和XX相互作用中心自旋模型（解限混沌）。

Result: 解限混沌通过相空间分离为大准可积区域和薄混沌流形实现，混沌和热化发生在相同时间尺度。

Conclusion: 解限混沌行为类似于量子SYK模型和奇异金属，其热化时间与扰动强度成反比。

Abstract: Weakly perturbed integrable many-body systems are typically chaotic and
thermal at late times. However, there are distinct relationships between the
timescales for thermalization and chaos. The typical relationship is confined
chaos: when trajectories are still confined to regions in phase space with
constant conserved quantities (actions), the conjugate angle variables are
already unstable. Confined chaos thus far precedes thermalization. In a
different relationship, which we term deconfined chaos, chaotic instabilities
and thermalization occur on the same timescale. We investigate these two
qualitatively distinct scenarios through numerical and analytical studies of
two perturbed integrable classical spin models: the Ishimori spin chain
(confined chaos), and the central spin model with XX interactions (deconfined
chaos). We analytically establish (super)-integrability in the latter model in
a microcanonical shell. Deconfined chaos emerges through the separation of
phase space into large quasi-integrable regions and a thin chaotic manifold.
The latter causes chaos and thermalization on the fastest possible timescale,
which is proportional to the inverse perturbation strength. This behavior is
reminiscent of the quantum SYK models and strange metals.

Motivation: 探索生物系统如何通过不完美的局部信息实现鲁棒控制，尤其是在非平衡模型中。

Result: 局部反馈规则在低维系统中具有全局稳定性，高维系统的吸引域也比线性近似预测的更广。

Conclusion: 生物和合成系统可通过最小反馈有效应对环境变化，无需高度工程化或精确参数调整。

Abstract: Understanding how biological systems achieve robust control despite relying
on imperfect local information remains a challenging problem. Here, we consider
non-equilibrium models which are generically used to describe natural and
synthetic biological processes, such as gene regulation and protein
conformational dynamics, and investigate their capacity for effective control
using imperfect local feedback mechanisms. We derive a thermodynamic constraint
on the response of non-equilibrium steady-state properties to changes in the
driving forces. We show that this constraint enables linear, local, and easily
implementable feedback rules to achieve environmental tracking and adaptation
without consideration of network topology. In particular, we demonstrate that
local stability of these feedback dynamics implies global stability for systems
with one or two chemical regulators, regardless of the network topology. For
higher-dimensional systems, global stability is not guaranteed. However, in
part due to simplifications in attractor landscapes implied by our
thermodynamic constraint, we find the basin of attraction remains significantly
larger than would be expected from linear approximation alone. Our findings
provide insight into how biological and synthetically engineered systems can
respond effectively to environmental changes given only minimal feedback,
without highly engineered interactions or precise parameter tuning.

Abstract: We show that mixtures comprised of multicomponent systems typically are much
more structurally complex than the sum of their parts; sometimes, infinitely
more complex. We contrast this with the more familiar notion of statistical
mixtures, demonstrating how statistical mixtures miss key aspects of emergent
hierarchical organization. This leads us to identify a new kind of structural
complexity inherent in multicomponent systems and to draw out broad
consequences for system ergodicity.

Result: 弱受挫区QAOA测量很少捕获第一激发态，而相变点附近激发态出现频率增加。

Conclusion: 量子涨落在相变点附近作用增强，QAOA能有效区分量子与经典行为。

Abstract: We investigated the quantum effects of a frustrated Ising model on a
two-dimensional square lattice using the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA). While strong spin frustration is known to induce quantum
fluctuations at low temperatures, previous classical approaches restricted to
binary (up or down) spin configurations have been insufficient to fully capture
the quantum contributions of frustration. In this study, we introduced a
quantitative metric to evaluate the quantum effects arising from frustration
and employed QAOA to differentiate between classical and quantum regimes.
Notably, we found that in the weakly frustrated region, QAOA measurements
rarely capture first excited states, as they are energetically well separated
from the ground state. In contrast, near the quantum phase transition point,
excited states appear more frequently in QAOA measurements, highlighting the
increased role of quantum fluctuations.

Result: 重置后的随机游走保持原跳跃分布但计数过程不同；零定律确保有效位移；主方程为完全单调重置律提供了理论框架。

Conclusion: 随机重置显著改变了CTRW的统计行为，零定律和主方程为理解和应用重置随机游走提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study a general continuous-time random walk (CTRW), by including
non-Markovian cases and L\'evy flights, under complete stochastic resetting to
the initial position with an arbitrary law, which can be power-lawed as well as
Poissonian. We provide three linked results. First, we show that the random
walk under stochastic resetting is a CTRW with the same jump-size distribution
of the non-reset original CTRW but different counting process. Later, we derive
the condition for a CTRW with stochastic resetting to be a meaningful
displacement process at large elapsed times, i.e., the probability to jump to
any site is higher than the probability to be reset to the initial position,
and we call this condition the zero-law for stochastic resetting. This law
joins with the other two laws for reset random walks concerning the existence
and the non-existence of a non-equilibrium stationary state. Finally, we derive
master equations for CTRWs when the resetting law is a completely monotone
function.

Result: 在非线性薛定谔方程、Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak模型和FPUT-beta模型中验证了理论的准确性，数值结果显示显著改进。

Conclusion: 为强非线性系统的平衡统计特性奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: The equilibrium distribution function determines macroscopic observables in
statistical physics. While conventional methods correct equilibrium
distributions in weakly nonlinear or near-integrable systems, they fail in
strongly nonlinear regimes. We develop a framework to get the equilibrium
distributions and dispersion relations in strongly nonlinear many-body systems,
incorporating corrections beyond the random phase approximation and capturing
intrinsic nonlinear effects. The theory is verified on the nonlinear
Schrodinger equation, the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak model, and the FPUT-beta
model, demonstrating its accuracy across distinct types of nonlinear systems.
Numerical results show substantial improvements over existing approaches, even
in strong nonlinear regimes. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for
equilibrium statistical properties in strongly nonlinear systems.

Abstract: Collective longitudinal and transverse propagating modes in molten Carbon at
$T=5500$~K and pressure range $10$-$40$ GPa are reported from {\it ab initio}
based as well as machine learned molecular dynamics. A striking exotic feature
in collective dynamics is the two-peak shape of the current spectral functions
of the single-component liquid, which makes evidence of a second branch of
longitudinal propagating modes in the wave number range $k>1$\AA$^{-1}$. It is
shown that time correlation functions reflecting the out-of-phase motion of
particles and their cages of nearest neighbors results in the same frequencies
of the exotic low-frequency branch of vibrations. A theoretical framework of
generalized collective modes is applied to recover the time dependence of
density-density, imaginary part of susceptibility and longitudinal
current-current correlations.

Motivation: 研究超均匀性在具有多个吸收态的系统中的临界行为，填补了RO类中ς的解析结果的空白。

Method: 使用Doi-Peliti场论和高斯模型的微扰重整化群方法，计算了不同维度下的ς值，并假设了强发散项的抵消模式。

Result: 在d>4和d=4-ε维度下分别得到ς=0⁺和ς=2ε/9 + O(ε²)，并发现RO与C-DP类在超均匀性指数上的差异。

Conclusion: RO类的超均匀性指数ς不同于C-DP类，表明尽管其他指数相同，两类在超均匀性行为上存在本质区别。

Abstract: Hyperuniformity, where the static structure factor obeys $S(q)\sim
q^{\varsigma}$ with $\varsigma> 0$, emerges at criticality in systems having
multiple, symmetry-unrelated, absorbing states. Important examples arise in
periodically sheared suspensions and amorphous solids; these lie in the random
organisation (RO) universality class, for which analytic results for
$\varsigma$ are lacking. Here, using Doi-Peliti field theory and perturbative
RG about a Gaussian model, we find $\varsigma = 0^+$ and $\varsigma=
2\epsilon/9 + O(\epsilon^2)$ in dimension $d>d_c=4$ and $d=4-\epsilon$
respectively. Our calculations assume that renormalizability is sustained via a
certain pattern of cancellation of strongly divergent terms. These
cancellations allow the upper critical dimension to remain $d_c = 4$, as is
known for RO, while generic perturbations (e.g., those violating particle
conservation) would typically flow to a fixed point with $d_c=6$. The assumed
cancellation pattern is closely reminiscent of a long-established one near the
tricritical Ising fixed point. (This has $d_c=3$, although generic
perturbations flow towards the Wilson-Fisher fixed point with $d_c = 4$.) We
show how hyperuniformity in RO emerges from anticorrelation of strongly
fluctuating active and passive densities. Our calculations also yield the
remaining exponents to order $\epsilon$, surprisingly without recourse to
functional RG. These exponents coincide as expected with the Conserved Directed
Percolation (C-DP) class which also contains the Manna Model and the quenched
Edwards-Wilkinson (q-EW) model. Importantly however, our $\varsigma$ differs
from one found via a mapping to q-EW. That mapping neglects a conserved noise
in the RO action, which we argue to be dangerously irrelevant. Thus, although
other exponents are common to both, the RO and C-DP universality classes have
different exponents for hyperuniformity.

Abstract: There is a dimensionless parameter which enters into the equation for the

typically a large number. Here it is argued that the consequent stiffness of

The instability is evident in numerical simulations of Ostwald ripening.

Motivation: 研究在$R$-复制二维共形场理论中，有效中心荷在重整化群流中的行为，并探索其在监测系统和无序系统中的物理意义。

Conclusion: 该定理为监测系统和无序系统提供了新的理论工具，并可能与其他极限下的有效中心荷存在联系。

Abstract: We present a general theorem demonstrating non-perturbatively the decrease of
the "effective central charge" $c_{\text{eff}}=(d c/dR)|_{R=1}$ under
renormalization group (RG) flow in the $R\rightarrow1$ replica limit of a
$R$-copy $2D$ conformal field theory (CFT) action $S_{*}$ perturbed by a
replica interaction of the form
$$-\mathbb{S}=-\sum_{a=1}^{R}S_{*}^{(a)}+\Delta\int d^2 x
\sum_{\substack{a,b=1\\ a\neq b}}^{R}\varphi^{(a)}(x)\varphi^{(b)}(x).$$ Here
$\varphi$ is a scaling field belonging to the CFT with action $S_*$ and the
coupling $\Delta$ is relevant in the RG sense. We show that the infrared value
of $c_{\text{eff}}$ is always $\textit{less}$ than the central charge $c$ of
the unperturbed CFT $S_{*}$. We refer to this result as the "$c$-effective
theorem". As an application of this theorem, we consider replica field theories
in the limit of $R \to 1$ replicas of the form above, shown by Nahum and
Jacobsen [arXiv:2504.01264] to describe $2D$ classical monitored systems, where
measurements introduce a form of quenched randomness via Bayes' theorem.
Lastly, we discuss a possible relationship of our theorem with the effective
central charge $c_{\text{eff}}^{(R\rightarrow0)}=(dc/dR)|_{R=0}$ for the above
replica action in the different $R\rightarrow0$ replica limit, which is of
relevance to systems with generic uncorrelated impurity-type quenched disorder,
as opposed to measurements.

Conclusion: 论文为非平衡态统计物理提供了新的理论工具，并揭示了超额可观测量在统计物理和强化学习中的核心作用。

Abstract: Near equilibrium, the symmetric part of the time-integrated steady-state
covariance, i.e., the time integral of correlation functions, is governed by
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, while the antisymmetric part vanishes due
to Onsager reciprocity. Far from equilibrium, where these principles no longer
apply, we develop a unified formalism for both symmetric and antisymmetric
components of integrated covariances. We derive exact, computationally
tractable expressions for these quantities, valid in arbitrary nonequilibrium
steady states of Markov jump processes. Both components are expressed in terms
of excess observables, a notion central to both statistical physics and
reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we establish thermodynamic upper bounds
for these covariances in terms of entropy production, dynamical activity, and
cycle affinities.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The coercivity panorama for characterizing the dynamic hysteresis in
interacting systems across multiple timescales is proposed by Chen et al. in a
companion paper. For the stochastic $\phi^4$ model under periodic driving of
rate $v_H$, the coercivity landscape $H_c(v_H)$ exhibits plateau features at a
characteristic rate $v_P$ with the corresponding coercivity $H_P$. Below this
plateau ($v_H<v_P$), the $H_c\sim v_H$ scaling obtained in the near-equilibrium
regime becomes inaccessible in the thermodynamic limit. Above the plateau
($v_H>v_P$), scaling in the fast-driving regime, $H_c\sim v_H^{1/2}$, is
completely different from that, $H_c-H_P\sim (v_H-v_P)^{2/3}$, in the
post-plateau slow-driving regime. The emergence of the plateau with a
finite-size scaling reflects the competition between the thermodynamic limit
and the quasi-static limit. In this paper, we provide detailed analytical
proofs and numerical evidence supporting these results. Moreover, to
demonstrate the coercivity panorama in concrete physical systems, we study the
magnetic hysteresis in the Curie-Weiss model and analyze its finite-size
effects. We reveal that finite-time coercivity scaling shows model-specific
behavior only in the fast-driving regime, while exhibiting universal
characteristics elsewhere.

Result: 在两种模型中，均发现了在高于居里温度时出现的不可压缩QAH相，且电荷激发会束缚三重态激子。

Conclusion: 研究表明，莫特性与能带拓扑的耦合可以产生高温QAH绝缘体，其电荷激发被三重态激子修饰。

Abstract: Motivated by experiments in which the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) charge gap
greatly exceeds the Curie temperature, we apply determinantal quantum Monte
Carlo to two complementary lattice models with different geometries: the
checkerboard quantum-spin-Hall-Hubbard model and the generalized
Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. In both cases an incompressible QAH phase with total
Chern number $C=\pm 1$ emerges at quarter filling well above the Curie
temperature. Each spin channel carries its own nonquantized Chern number while
remaining only partly filled, revealing a topological Mott insulator where
Mottness opens the charge gap before magnetic order appears. Charge excitations
bind triplet excitons that suppress net magnetization, a many-body dynamical
effect absent in mean-field theory. The concurrence of these results on two
very different models shows that coupling Mottness with band topology
generically yields a high-temperature QAH insulator whose charge excitations
are dressed by triplet excitons.

Conclusion: 反对称拉曼响应为研究微观特征和对称性破缺提供了新的实验手段。

Abstract: We develop the theory of antisymmetric Raman response, defined as the
difference between the Raman signals of two scattering geometries related by an
exchange of mutually perpendicular incoming and the outgoing photon
polarizations. Such responses, finite in orthorhombic or lower symmetry
systems, are related to cross-susceptibilities of two Raman operators and are
characterized by the absence of intraband terms. This is in contrast to
standard Raman responses which measure auto-susceptibilities where both intra-
and interband processes contribute. We illustrate the theory with examples from
the charge density wave rare-earth tritellurides and the excitonic insulator
Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$. Our theory establishes antisymmetric Raman response as a unique
tool to probe microscopic features such as interband energy scales and to
detect reflection symmetry breaking.

Abstract: We describe a method for computing the anomaly of any finite unitary symmetry
group $G$ acting by finite-depth quantum circuits on a two-dimensional lattice
system. The anomaly is characterized by an index valued in the cohomology group
$H^4(G,U(1))$, which generalizes the Else-Nayak index for locality preserving
symmetries of quantum spin chains. We show that a nontrivial index precludes
the existence of a trivially gapped symmetric Hamiltonian; it is also an
obstruction to ``onsiteability" of the symmetry action. We illustrate our
method via a simple example with
$G=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$.
Finally, we provide a diagrammatic interpretation of the anomaly formula which
hints at a higher categorical structure.

Abstract: We explore topological electronic structure of magnetic phases in a
multi-orbital Hubbard model with spin-orbit interactions. To account for more
general antiferromagnetic orders that go beyond the collinear N\'eel order, two
different spin-orbit interactions, Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit
interactions, are considered. By performing the canonical transformation, we
derive the corresponding generalized t-J model. At half filling, employing
self-consistent magnetic order calculations, we find distinctive spin
arrangements under Dresselhaus or Rashba spin-orbit interactions. For the
Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, the spin configuration exhibits collinear
antiferromagnetic order. On the other hand, Rashba interaction results in spins
antiferromagnetically aligning in xy-plane and a small interaction controlled
by hopping parameter induces spin tilting, causing antiferromagnetic alignment
in xy-plane but ferromagnetic alignment in z-direction. We categorize
topological properties of these phases for low doping in the generalized t-J
model.: for 3D collinear antiferromagnetic order, the system possesses a
modified time-reversal symmetry, characterized by the Z2 index. In contrast,
for systems with tilted antiferromagnetic orders, it is protected by inversion
symmetry and characterized by the Z4 index. We further examine the bulk-edge
correspondence for non-collinear magnetic phases, revealing that the surface
state becomes gapless when the surface is parallel to the ferromagnetic
component of tilted antiferromagnetic order; otherwise, the surface state
exhibits a gap. Our findings offer a comprehensive topological characterization
for doped and canted antiferromagnetic insulators with spin-orbit interactions,
providing valuable insights into the interplay between spin arrangements,
symmetries, and topological properties in systems governed by the multi-orbital

Abstract: Spontaneous magnon decays in an $S=\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on
the equilateral triangular prism are investigated in terms of modified magnon
Green's functions. In one dimension, the so-called infrared divergence prevents
us from calculating any -- whether static or dynamic -- structure factor within
the conventional spin-wave theory even at zero temperature. The well-known
modified spin-wave theory initiated by Takahashi completely fails to treat
anharmonicities to cause transverse-to-longitudinal coupling which are quite
characteristic of noncollinear antiferromagnets. We propose imposing a
double-constraint condition on spin waves to solve all these difficulties and
get a full view of the nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in one-dimensional
frustrated noncollinear antiferromagnets. We reveal a novel instability of the
single-particle spectrum in the absence of any well-defined magnetically
ordered ground state.

Abstract: A key to understand how electrons behave in crystalline solids is the band
structure that connects the energy of electron waves to their wavenumber (k).
Even in the phase of matter with only short-range order (liquid or amorphous
solid), the coherent part of electron waves still possesses a band structure.
Theoretical models for the band structure of liquid metals were formulated more
than 5 decades ago, but thus far, bandstructure renormalization and pseudogap
induced by resonance scattering have remained unobserved. Here, we report the
observation of this unusual band structure at the interface of a crystalline
insulator (black phosphorus) and disordered dopants (alkali metals). We find
that a conventional parabolic band structure of free electrons bends back
towards zero k with the pseudogap of 30-240 meV from the Fermi level. This is k
renormalization caused by resonance scattering that leads to the formation of
quasi-bound states in the scattering potential of alkali-metal ions. The depth
of this potential tuned by different kinds of alkali metal (Na, K, Rb, and Cs)
allows to classify the pseudogap of p-wave and d-wave resonance. Our results
may provide a clue to the puzzling spectrum of various crystalline insulators
doped by disordered dopants, such as the waterfall dispersion in cuprates.

Abstract: A key concept proposed by Landau to explain superfluid liquid helium is the
elementary excitation of quantum particles called rotons. The irregular
arrangement of atoms in a liquid forms the aperiodic dispersion of rotons that
played a pivotal role in understanding fractional quantum Hall liquid
(magneto-rotons) and the supersolidity of Bose-Einstein condensates. Even for a
two-dimensional electron or dipole liquid in the absence of a magnetic field,
their repulsive interactions were predicted to form a roton minimum that can be
used to trace the transition to Wigner crystals and superconductivity, but it
has not been observed. Here, we report the observation of such electronic
rotons in a two-dimensional dipole liquid of alkali-metal ions doping charges
to surface layers of black phosphorus. Our data reveal a striking aperiodic
dispersion of rotons characterized by a local minimum of energy at a finite
momentum. As the density of dipoles decreases, where interactions dominate over
kinetic energy, the roton gap reduces to 0 as in crystals, signalling Wigner
crystallisation. Our model shows the importance of short-range order arising
from repulsion between dipoles, which can be viewed as the formation of Wigner
crystallites (bubbles or stripes) floating in the sea of Fermi liquids. Our
results reveal that the primary origin of electronic rotons (and the pseudogap)
is strong correlations.

Motivation: 受双层铜酸盐和镍酸盐超导体La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$的启发，研究层内到层间超导的转变机制。

Method: 使用密度矩阵重整化群计算，通过调节$J_{\bot}$在掺杂范围$\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$内研究量子相图。

Result: 大$J_{\bot}$可驱动层间超导，中间可能通过电荷密度波（CDW）相或直接转变；层间超导在强$J_{\bot}$下稳定。

Conclusion: 层间超导在多种条件下稳定，且中间CDW相在有限掺杂范围内存在。

Abstract: Motivated by the bilayer cuprate superconductors and nickelate superconductor
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we investigate the evolution from intralayer to interlayer
superconductivity based on a bilayer two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_{\bot}$ model, where
$t$ is the in-plane electron hopping, $J$ is the in-plane spin interaction, and
$J_{\bot}$ is the inter-plane spin interaction. By means of the density matrix
renormalization group calculations, we obtain the quantum phase diagram of the
system by tuning $J_{\bot}$ in a large doping range $\delta = 1/8 - 1/2$. We
find that a large $J_{\bot}$ can always drive an interlayer superconductivity
by coupling the two layers in both the Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger liquid
states. By coupling two Luther-Emery liquid states, the in-plane
superconductivity evolves to inter-plane superconductivity either through an
intermediate charge density wave (CDW) phase or directly, depending on doping
ratio. This emergent CDW phase, which exists over a finite doping range,
appears to develop from the CDW state of the two-leg ladder at $\delta = 1/4$.
By coupling two Luttinger liquids, the in-plane Luttinger liquids show a
transition to the inter-plane superconducting phase at large $J_{\bot}$, as
reported in previous literature. Interestingly, in the intermediate $J_{\bot}$
regime we find that while the in-plane Luttinger-liquid features remain stable,
the inter-plane superconductivity can develop an enhanced quasi-long-range
order with the power exponent $K^{zz}_{\rm SC} \sim 1$. At last, we show that
the interlayer superconductivity is also stable by coupling the bilayer
three-leg $t$-$J$ ladders by a strong $J_{\bot}$ interaction, from both the
Luther-Emery liquid and Luttinger-liquid states.

Conclusion: 结果为QED3-CS固定点的稳定性提供了微观支持，并为探索其他Landau禁止的相变提供了方法蓝图。

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions between topologically ordered and symmetry-broken
phases lie beyond Landau theory. A prime example is the conjectured continuous
transition from the bosonic $\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state to a superfluid,
proposed to be governed by a QED$_3$--Chern--Simons (CS) critical point whose
stability remains uncertain. We study half-filled bosons in the lowest Landau
level subject to a lattice potential. Infinite-cylinder DMRG reveals a single
continuous Laughlin--to--superfluid transition. Adiabatic flux insertion
collapses the many-body gap and exposes massless Dirac quasiparticles, while
momentum-resolved correlation lengths show that three lattice-related density
modes share the same critical exponent, evidencing an emergent $SO(3)$
symmetry. The joint appearance of Dirac dispersion and symmetry enlargement
provides microscopic support for a stable QED$_3$--CS fixed point. Our
numerical strategy also offers a blueprint for exploring Landau-forbidden
transitions in fractional Chern insulators and composite Fermi liquids realised
in moire and cold-atom systems.

Result: 发现高压下Nb$_{3}$三聚体的局部对称性从$C_{3v}$降至$C_{s}$，导致带宽增强和能带简并解除，但簇莫特绝缘态仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: 压力诱导的对称性破缺通过增加带宽和减少库仑相互作用降低了电荷隙，但簇莫特绝缘态的本质未变，为理解相关簇化合物的量子态提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In this work, by combining density-functional theory (DFT) with dynamical
mean-field calculations (DMFT), we compare the crystal and electronic
structures of the prototype cluster Mott insulator Nb$_{3}$Cl$_8$ at ambient
and high-pressure. We explain the finite but significantly reduced charge gap
experimentally observed at $P=9.7$ GPa. We reveal a local symmetry breaking of
the Nb$_{3}$ trimer under pressure, reducing its symmetry from $C_{3v}$ to
$C_{s}$. This leads to a strong bandwidth enhancement and a lift of band
degeneracy. Crucially, despite the significant change of band details, the
cluster Mott insulating state is robust against local symmetry breaking. We
show that the experimental observed gap under pressure is still a cluster Mott
gap and its reduced value stems from both increased bandwidth and reduced
Coulomb interactions under pressure. Our study provides the first systematic
theoretical elucidation of how pressure-induced symmetry breaking dictates the
cluster Mott state, establishing a robust foundation for understanding the
intricate relationship between symmetry, local/non-local correlations, and
emergent quantum states in correlated cluster compounds.

Conclusion: 通过几何阻挫可以调控自旋序和净磁化，为多体系统的空间分辨量子控制开辟了新途径，并提出了在冷原子实验中实现的方案。

Abstract: Kinetic magnetism is an iconic and rare example of collective quantum order
that emerges from the interference of paths taken by a hole in a sea of
strongly interacting fermions. Here the lattice topology plays a fundamental
role, with odd loops frustrating ferromagnetism, as seen in recent experiments.
However, the resulting magnetic order on a general graph has remained elusive.
Here we systematically establish, using exact diagonalization, that local
frustration centers on a grid strongly bind singlets while sharing a
delocalized hole. This collective effect generalizes to random graphs,
producing sharp and predictable variation with tunable frustration measures.
Our findings demonstrate that one can shape the spin order as well as tune the
net magnetization by embedding geometric frustration, opening up new avenues
for spatially resolved quantum control of many-body systems. We outline a
protocol to realize some of the key findings in existing cold-atom setups.

Abstract: We study numerically the real time dynamics of lattice polarons by combining

a multivariable function of polaron world line parameters, can be compressed as
a low bond dimension MPS, thereby allowing for efficient evaluation of various

benchmarking the calculated polaron spectral function in one dimension against
available results. We further demonstrate its potential by presenting the
polaron spectral function in two dimensions and simulating polaron diffusion in
both one and two dimensions.

Abstract: We have carried out a detailed high-pressure investigation on the strongly
correlated transition metal chalcogenide $Cr_{3}Te_4$ using Raman spectroscopy
and XRD, which is ferromagnetic and metallic at ambient conditions. We find
that the monoclinic structure remains stable up to 30 GPa, the highest pressure
studied. The Cr-Te bond length and octahedral volume decrease drastically up to
7.6 GPa pressure. The $A_{1g}$ Raman mode shows a red shift up to 7.6 GPa, and
the $E_g$ Raman mode shows a sudden drop around the same pressure. Further
low-temperature Raman spectroscopic investigation shows that the Raman modes
soften at the ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition. This
suggests a change in the magnetic ordering at high pressure. Our Density
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal the change in magnetic ground state
from ferromagnetic state to antiferromagnetic state above 7.6 GPa pressure,
corroborating our experimental result.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting
electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes,
yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established.
Motivated by recent observations in twisted MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral
pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent
to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model:
spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable moire
potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations
show that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before a
metallic state forms. A chiral $f+if$ superconductor and a commensurate
$\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) differ in energy by less
than $1\%$, reproducing the distinct superconducting and re-entrant integer
quantum Hall (RIQH) phases experimentally observed near the FCI regime. The
superconducting dome remains robust against realistic Coulomb screening, light
doping, and variations in lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides
a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH
order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a
superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this
superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH
state.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决实验观察到的热霍尔电导κ与数值模拟结果之间的矛盾，特别是填充因子ν=5/2的量子霍尔态中PH-Pfaffian态与Pfaffian或AntiPfaffian态的不一致。

Method: 结合密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG）对物理实际边缘的研究和解析计算边缘结构，提出了一种基于中性Majorana边缘重构的机制。

Result: Majorana边缘重构可以“屏蔽”Pfaffian或AntiPfaffian体态，使其输运特征与PH-Pfaffian态无法区分，从而解释了实验观察。

Conclusion: 提出的Majorana边缘重构机制是一种物理上自然的解释，与实验结果一致，为解决实验与理论之间的矛盾提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pioneering thermal transport measurements on two-dimensional electron gases
in high magnetic fields have demonstrated that the quantized Hall state at
filling factor $\nu=5/2$ has a thermal Hall conductance $\kappa$ quantized in
half-integer multiples of $\kappa_0 = {\pi^2 k_B^2 T}/{3h}$. Half-integer
$\kappa/\kappa_0$ is a signature of neutral Majorana edge modes, in turn linked
to the presence of non-Abelian anyon excitations in the bulk. However, the
experimentally observed value of $\kappa$ corresponds to the 'PH-Pfaffian'
state, in tension with numerical studies which instead favor either the
Pfaffian or the AntiPfaffian. A variety of mechanisms have been invoked to
explain this discrepancy, but have been either ruled out by further experiments
or else involve fine-tuning. Building on density-matrix-renormalization group
studies of physically realistic edges and analytic calculations of edge
structure, we propose an alternative resolution of this puzzle involving an
'edge reconstruction' solely involving the neutral Majorana sector of the
theory. Such a Majorana edge reconstruction can "screen'' a Pfaffian or
AntiPfaffian bulk, so that transport signatures become indistinguishable from
those of the PH-Pfaffian. We argue that this physically natural scenario is
consistent with experiment.

Abstract: Excitons are a prime example of how electron interactions affect optical
response and excitation. We demonstrate that, beyond its spectra, the bound
nature of an exciton's electron-hole pair produces a correlated quantum
geometry: excitonic excitations possess a quantum shift vector that is
independent of light polarization. We find this counterintuitive behavior has
dramatic consequences for geometric response: e.g., in noncentrosymmetric but
non-polar materials, vertical excitonic transitions possess vanishing shift
vector zeroing their shift photocurrent; this contrasts with finite and
strongly light polarization dependent shift vectors for non-interacting
delocalized particle-hole excitations. This dichotomy makes shift vector a
sharp diagnostic of the pair localization properties of particle-hole
excitations and demonstrates the non-perturbative effects of electron
interactions in excited state quantum geometric response.

Abstract: Negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR) is a decrease in the
electrical resistivity of a material when the driving electric field and an
external magnetic field are collinear. In the semiclassical weak field regime,
the NLMR of non-magnetic metals is activated in the presence of substantial
concentrations of Berry curvature (BC). This restricts the appearance of a
semi-classical NLMR to metals with acentric crystalline arrangements, including
Weyl semimetals. Here, we show a previously unidentified mechanism of
semi-classical NLMR that can be present in strongly spin-orbit coupled
non-magnetic metals even if the crystal possess bulk inversion symmetry. A
Zeeman-activated BC directly couples to the orbital motion of Bloch electrons
to generate a negative MR that scales with the relaxation time precisely as the
Drude resistivity. Importantly, the Zeeman-activated BC is \emph{independent}
of the external magnetic field strength. It is instead related to the degree of
non-parabolicity of the spin-orbit coupled electronic bands. We show that this
NLMR mechanism, which is independent of the Land\'e $g$-factor, is generic and
appears in \emph{all} centrosymmetric point groups and can occur both in
topological and conventional conductors.

Abstract: Multi-exciton correlations shape the photo-induced response of nanostructured
materials, particularly when interactions are enhanced by light confinement.
Here multidimensional coherent spectroscopy is used to quantify biexciton and
exciton-polariton dynamics in a semiconductor microcavity. One- and two-quantum
spectra, which are dominated by polariton-related contributions, also include a
polarization-dependent biexciton feature whose magnitude and spectral
coordinates depend on the detuning between the cavity mode and the exciton
resonance. Comparison of spectra acquired using collinear and noncollinear
experimental geometries indicates that excitation wavevector plays no
significant role in this behavior. The measured energy dispersion and cavity
enhancement are not compatible with uncoupled biexcitons or bipolaritons. To
explain the measurements, an indirect biexciton-photon coupling model is
introduced whereby biexcitons are formed from dark excitons that Coulomb couple
to the bright-exciton fraction of the polaritons. The model addresses
inconsistent observations of biexcitons previously reported in semiconductor
microcavities and is generalizable to any material where optically dark
excitons contribute to light-matter interaction. Our results suggest a
mechanism to access long-lived dark excitons through multi-exciton correlations
in strongly coupled systems.

Abstract: We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that
is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The
transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the
current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the
nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients
calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL
package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for
both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies
observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the
treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common
issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and
allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into
contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an
effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing
current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By
leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a
robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current
quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.

Abstract: The confinement of molecules within the van der Waals (vdW) gap between a
two-dimensional 2D material and a catalytic substrate offers a promising route
toward the development of molecule-selective catalysts with increased reaction
rates. However, identifying the kinetic limitations of such confined reactions
remains challenging. Here, we employ an inverted wedding-cake configuration of
multilayer graphene on platinum to study the dynamics of graphene etching in
the vdW gap by various molecules (O2, H2, and CO), using in situ scanning
electron microscopy. Under the experimental conditions explored (up to p =
1.4x10-3 Pa and T = 1000 {\deg}C), the etching reaction rates are limited by
mass transport within the confined space. This limitation persists even for CO,
despite its anomalously enhanced transport resulting from a significant lifting
of the vdW gap. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations further reveal multiple
etching pathways for CO, enabled by confinement within the vdW space. Once
mass-transport limitations are overcome, the vdW gap acts as an effective
nanoreactor, facilitating reaction pathways that would be otherwise
inaccessible on a pristine surface without spatial confinement.

Conclusion: hBN/石墨烯GFET是一种有前景的下一代二维闪存平台，具有多功能性和高效能。

Abstract: We present a graphene-based memory platform built on dual-gated field-effect
transistors (GFETs). By integrating a lithographically defined metal patch
directly atop the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-graphene channel, the device
functions simultaneously as a top gate, floating gate (FG) reservoir, and
active reset contact. This architecture forms an ultrathin van der Waals
heterostructure with strong capacitive coupling to the back-gate, confirmed by
a dynamic model, enabling a tunable and wide memory window that scales with
back-gate voltage and is further enhanced by reducing hBN thickness or
increasing FG area. Our devices demonstrate reversible, high-efficiency charge
programming, robust non-volatile behavior across 10 to 300 K and a wide range
of operation speeds, and endurance beyond 9800 cycles. Importantly, a grounded
top electrode provides on-demand charge erasure, offering functionality that is
absent in standard FG designs. These results position hBN/graphene-based GFETs
as a compact, energy-efficient platform for next-generation 2D flash memory,
with implications for multilevel memory schemes and cryogenic electronics.

Abstract: Edge states reflect the key physical properties yet are difficult to probe
individually, particularly when several states are present at an edge. We
present momentum resolved tunneling spectroscopy between a quantum well and a
quantum wire to extract the dispersions of the quantum Hall edge states.
Momentum and energy selective tunneling allows to separately address the
different states even if they are spatially overlapping. This delivers the edge
state velocities over broad ranges of magnetic field and density, in excellent
agreement with a hard-wall model. This technique provides a basis for future
edge state selective spectroscopy on quantum materials.

Abstract: Cavities provide a means to manipulate the optical and electronic responses
of quantum materials by selectively enhancing light-matter interaction at
specific frequencies and momenta. While cavities typically involve external
structures, exfoliated flakes of van der Waals (vdW) materials can form
intrinsic self-cavities due to their small finite dimensions, confining
electromagnetic fields into plasmonic cavity modes, characterized by
standing-wave current distributions. While cavity-enhanced phenomena are
well-studied at optical frequencies, the impact of self-cavities on nonlinear
electronic responses--such as photogalvanic currents--remains largely
unexplored, particularly in the terahertz regime, critical for emerging
ultrafast optoelectronic technologies. Here, we report a self-cavity-induced
Purcell enhancement of photogalvanic currents in the vdW semimetal WTe$_2$.
Using ultrafast optoelectronic circuitry, we measured coherent near-field THz
emission resulting from nonlinear photocurrents excited at the sample edges. We
observed enhanced emission at finite frequencies, tunable via excitation
fluence and sample geometry, which we attribute to plasmonic interference
effects controlled by the cavity boundaries. We developed an analytical theory
that captures the cavity resonance conditions and spectral response across
multiple devices. Our findings establish WTe$_2$ as a bias-free,
geometry-tunable THz emitter and demonstrate the potential of self-cavity
engineering for controlling nonlinear, nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum
materials.
