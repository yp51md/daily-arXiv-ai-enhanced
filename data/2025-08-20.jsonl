Simulating the defect's optical response and optically\ndetected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast is key to identifying suitable\ncandidates.

Here, we propose two quantum algorithms to detect an\nimbalance in the triplet-to-singlet intersystem crossing (ISC) rates between\nexcited states with the same and different spin projections -- a necessary\ncondition for nonzero ODMR response. The lowest-cost approach evaluates whether\nthe evolution of an $S=0$ state under the spin-orbit coupling induces ISC to\n$S=1$, and also whether there is an imbalance in its intensity depending on the\nfinal state spin projection. The second approach works by comparing the\nemission spectrum of a spin defect with and without the spin-orbit coupling\noperator, inferring ISC intensity for different spin transition channels from\nspectrum intensity changes.

In this Letter,\nby introducing higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) -- a powerful computer\nscience tool -- to SET physics, we establish a unified approach for complete\ncharacterization of anyon mobility induced by the complexity of subsystem\nsymmetries.
