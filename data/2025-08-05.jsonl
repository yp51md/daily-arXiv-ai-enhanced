The solutions\nof the coupled differential equations, in discretized state, give a fast\nannealing algorithm (cost $N^3$) in estimating the ground state of the model:\nClassical ($E^0= -0.7629 \\pm 0.0002$), Quantum ($E^0=-0.7623 \\pm 0.0001$) and\nMixed ($E^0=-0.7626 \\pm 0.0001$), all of which are to be compared with the best\nknown estimate $E^0= -0.763166726 \\dots$ .

One of the key steps for proving classical\nhardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one\ncan ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of\nHaar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove\nthe hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed\nstates, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen\net al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states\nthat a $o(\\sqrt{M})\\times o(\\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\\times M$ circular\northogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex\nGaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\\to\\infty$.

We provide insight into the saturation conditions for\nthese bounds and to what degree saturation can be achieved. Additionally, for\nthe TUR and TB, we show how the bounds are related, which includes identifying\na diffusion coefficient for jump dynamics. %An example using a toy model shows\nhow the CB may yield a negative lower bound on the total entropy production,\ncontrary to the non-negative bound that the TUR and TB yield.

In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral\nrepresentation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability,\nwhich systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by\nchanging the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that\nwe employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral,\nand its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition\nof the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness\ncondition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we\nconfirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact\ndynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of\nnumerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work\nclarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and\nsimplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved."}

In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum\nsystems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum\nsystems, that is based on the Schr\\\"odinger equation. However, if we consider\nthe FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but\nfinite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is\ninevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative\nsystems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation. In particular, we show\nthat a nonequilibrium steady state appears after a long driving due to the\nbalance between the energy injection by the driving field and the release to\nthe bath. In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet\ntheory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation\nof motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied\nonly to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution\nfunction of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can\narrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems. We illustrate the essence\nof the Floquet theory for classical systems. On top of fundamentals of the\nFloquet theory, we review representative examples of FEs (Floquet topological\ninsulators, inverse Faraday effects in metals and magnets, Kapitza pendulum,\netc.) and dissipation-assisted FEs."}

When the hopping integral and the on-site\npotential of the fermions depend on the direction of the link spins, the\nlow-energy effective theory predicts that the link spins behave as a dynamical\naxion field in 1+1 dimensions. The axion field $\\theta$ is coupled to the\nelectric field $E$ as $\\theta E$, through which the link spins rotate in\nresponse to the applied electric field or the chemical potential gradient for\ncharge-neutral fermions. This is the inverse phenomenon of Thouless pumping in\nthe Rice-Mele model. After analyzing the dynamics by approximating the link\nspins with the classical ones and utilizing the axion Lagrangian, we show the\nfull-quantum dynamics using the tensor network method. Even though we do not\nexplicitly introduce the axion Lagrangian in solving the fermion-spin coupled\nmany-body dynamics, the full-quantum results agree well with those with the\nclassical spin approximation, including the dynamics of the axion field and\nfermion transport.

The challenge is further\ncompounded by the model's SU(2) symmetry; the study of ETH compliance is\nnecessarily done for each symmetry sector but separating different sectors of\nthis symmetry is known to be a computationally demanding task. The current\nstudy is driven by two main motivations: first, to explore whether the\nwell-known ground-state phases of the model have any bearing on its\nthermalization properties; and second, to understand how the interplay between\ntwo competing factors, namely, the non-uniformity (via {\\delta}) and the\nbeyond-nearest-neighbor interactions (via J2) governs the system's approach to\nthermal equilibrium.

Moreover, short-channel effects in this length scale\nare not yet fully understood. In this work, we investigate the transport\nproperties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm,\nusing first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green\nfunction formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an\neffective gate model. Our simulations reveal a classical-to-quantum crossover\nin electron transport during transistor downscaling, governed by two critical\ntemperatures: Tc, which marks the crossover from thermionic emission to quantum\ntunneling, and Tt, beyond which thermionic emission dominates and the\nsubthreshold swing approaches its classical limit. The shortest 3 nm junction\nexhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold\nswing superior to the Boltzmann tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence\nof the transmission coefficient. This quantum-tunneling-enhanced switching\nbehavior demonstrates the potential of ultra-scaled 2D FETs to surpass\nclassical efficiency constraints, offering a promising route toward\nenergy-efficient, quantum-enabled computing technologies.

In many theoretical studies for FE in quantum\nsystems, researchers have used the Floquet theory for closed (isolated) quantum\nsystems, that is based on the Schr\\\"odinger equation. However, if we consider\nthe FE in materials driven by an oscillating field like a laser, a weak but\nfinite interaction between a target system and an environment (bath) is\ninevitable. In this article, we describe these periodically driven dissipative\nsystems by means of the quantum master (GKSL) equation.

In addition to quantum systems, if we try to simply apply Floquet\ntheory to periodically driven classical systems, it failed because the equation\nof motion (EOM) is generally nonlinear, and the Floquet theorem can be applied\nonly to linear differential equations. Instead, by considering the distribution\nfunction of the classical variables (i.e., Fokker-Planck equation), one can\narrive at the effective EOM for the driven systems.

However, since the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is a linear equation, Hamiltonian simulation is often\nlimited to linear equations. The research on Hamiltonian simulation methods for\nnonlinear governing equations remains relatively limited. In this study, we\npropose a Hamiltonian simulation method for nonlinear partial differential\nequations (PDEs). The proposed method is named Carleman linearization +\nSchr\\\"odingerization (CLS), which combines Carleman linearization (CL) and\nwarped phase transformation (WPT). CL is first applied to transform a nonlinear\nPDE into a linear differential equation. This linearized equation is then\nmapped to the Schr\\\"odinger equation via WPT. The original nonlinear PDE can be\nsolved efficiently by the Hamiltonian simulation of the resulting Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. By applying this method, we transform the original governing equation\ninto the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Solving the transformed Schr\\\"odinger equation\nthen enables the analysis of the original nonlinear equation. As a specific\napplication, we apply this method to the nonlinear reaction--diffusion equation\nto demonstrate that Hamiltonian simulations are applicable to nonlinear PDEs."}

Two prominent extensions\nof this framework are the multi-time state (MTS) formalism, which incorporates\ntime symmetry via arbitrary pre- and post-selection, and the post-selected\nclosed timelike curve (P-CTC) framework, which enables cyclic causal influences\nthrough post-selection on maximally entangled states. While prior work has\nnoted structural connections between MTS and P-CTCs, it remained unclear\nwhether an operational equivalence exists, or whether constructive mappings can\nbe established between their most general objects. In this work, we address\nthis gap by extending the P-CTC framework to define time-labelled P-CTC\nassisted combs, a more general class of P-CTC-assisted objects that support\nopen processing slots and explicit temporal structure. We prove that for every\n(possibly mixed) MTS, there exists an operationally equivalent time-labelled\nP-CTC-assisted comb, and vice versa. The equivalence is shown via explicit\nmappings, while discussing the number and dimensionality of the P-CTCs\ninvolved. We also explore a resource-theoretic view of MTS, defining a partial\norder under free transformations that do not use P-CTCs. We conclude by\ndiscussing future directions informed by the operational equivalence between\ntime symmetry and cyclic causality established here."}

Appendix: 68 pages, 47 figures", "summary": "We investigate a novel class of topological superconducting phases protected\nby exact fermion-parity symmetry and average crystalline symmetries. These\nphases belong to the broader class of average crystalline symmetry-protected\ntopological (ACSPT) states and include numerous examples of intrinsic ACSPTs --\ntopological phases that arise only in the presence of disorder or decoherence.\nUnlike conventional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, which require\nexact symmetry protection, average SPT (ASPT) phases remain robust as long as\nthe symmetry is restored on average across disorder realizations or mixed-state\nensembles. To classify these phases, we extend the real-space block state\nconstruction framework to account for average crystalline symmetries. In this\ngeneralized setting, lower-dimensional cells are decorated with ASPT phases,\nand the obstruction-free conditions are reformulated to incorporate the\nconstraints imposed by average symmetry at block intersections. This provides a\nphysically transparent and systematic method for classifying ASPTs with spatial\nsymmetries that are only preserved statistically. We further validate our\nclassification using a generalized spectral sequence analysis, which serves as\nan independent consistency check. Our results demonstrate that many crystalline\ntopological superconductors remain well defined under realistic imperfections,\nand they uncover a rich landscape of intrinsically average-symmetry-protected\nphases that have no analog in clean systems."}
