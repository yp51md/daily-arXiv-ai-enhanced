Physica Scripta 2025", "summary": "The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}>0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics."}

Environmental noise also has a crucial role in controlling this class of hysteresis. The relaxational delay of the system's response towards the periodic drive manifests in the response function-field hysteresis loops. These hysteresis loops are generally symmetric in the range of the external force and the response function. Symmetry breaking is observed under extreme conditions of the noise strength, amplitude and frequency of the periodic force. This symmetric-asymmetric dynamic transition is interpreted in terms of the relevant order parameter defined for the system under study. In our present work, we importantly identify that it is possible to induce symmetry breaking in the hysteresis loops, and consequently to observe dynamic transitions under moderate conditions as well if appropriate asymmetry is implemented in the design of the underlying potential. We develop a quantitative understanding of the variation of the hysteresis loop area and the order parameter with respect to the degree of asymmetry in the potential. Our study suggests an ingenious way to get the desired outputs in the processes related to dynamic hysteresis by effectively controlling the asymmetry of the intrinsic potential governing the dynamics. These findings not only direct a new and impactful path for technological advances involving hysteresis but also provide the basic understanding of the precise role of the underlying potential in regulating this fundamental process, which manifests frequently in natural and designed systems."}

While uncorrelated disorder is widely accepted to localize all single-particle eigenstates, a phenomenon typically reinforced by interactions in the Many-Body Localization (MBL) regime, we report a counter-intuitive breakdown of this paradigm. We demonstrate that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, driving the system into a macroscopically segregated phase where spin species accumulate at opposite boundaries. Although this boundary accumulation phenomenologically mimics the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE) observed in non-reciprocal systems, our comprehensive analysis reveals a fundamentally different origin. By performing a rigorous control experiment in the Hermitian limit, we prove that the segregation persists without non-reciprocity, identifying many-body energy minimization as the primary driver. This \"interaction-induced segregation\" manifests as a sharp thermodynamic crossover, characterized by a divergent energy susceptibility, challenging the conventional understanding of disorder-interaction competition in open quantum systems."}

Along with the tunability of the magnon-photon coupling strength, fast information transfer and conversion speed are desired in hybrid devices. This can be achieved utilizing the propagating nature of spin waves with non-zero momentum for their ultra-fast time dynamics and reduced ohmic dissipation. Antiferromagnets are particularly interesting as hosts for magnons since stray-field interactions are minimized, and they support multiple modes with distinctive magnetic-field behavior across the phase diagram. CrCl3 is a van der Waals antiferromagnet having a strong easy-plane anisotropy and a weak in-plane easy-axis anisotropy. Despite some magnetic resonance studies, the impact of magnetic reorientation of spins in CrCl3 on cavity-magnon-polariton interaction strength as a function of magnetic field remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the coupling between magnons in CrCl3 and photons in a coplanar waveguide resonator as a function of magnetic field. In particular, we find that the magnon-photon coupling strength varies nonmonotonically and distinctly with the magnetic field for both acoustic and optical magnons, enabling tuning of the coupling strength with an external magnetic field as a knob. We find the signature of spin-flop transition in two harmonics of the cavity due to a stronger dispersive coupling between optical magnons and cavity photons at lower fields. Additionally, we find standing modes formed by spin waves with nonzero momentum associated with the two hybrid magnons when the external field is applied at an angle with the crystal plane. These modes do not undergo substantial coupling with the cavity mode unlike the antiferromagnetic modes and can be used as low-loss propagation channels in hybrid devices."}

When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear.

Among the various reinforcement learning methodologies, gradient-based approaches, particularly policy gradient methods, are considered to have many benefits. Moreover, in the quantum regime, they also have a profit in that they can be readily implemented through parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). From the perspective of learning, two indicators can be regarded as most crucial: expressivity and, for gradient-based methods, trainability. While a number of attempts have been made to quantify the expressivity and trainability of PQCs, clear efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have so far been lacking. Therefore, in this study, we newly define the notion of expressivity suited to reinforcement learning and demonstrate that the mutual information between action distribution and reward-signal distribution can, in certain respects, indicate information about both expressivity and trainability. Such research is valuable in that it provides an easy criterion for choosing among various PQCs employed in reinforcement learning, and further, enables the indirect estimation of learning progress even in black-box settings where the agent's achievement aligned with the episodes cannot be explicitly evaluated."}

Employing a Fermi-Hubbard model alongside the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we examine the combined effects of RSOC and DSOC on these exotic superfluid phases, taking into account attractive fermionic interactions. Our principal finding reveals that while RSOC primarily stabilizes conventional zero-momentum pairing, DSOC performs a distinct and crucial role in selectively stabilizing the intraband FFLO phase. This stabilization is achieved by enhancing spin polarization within a single helicity band and suppressing interband coherence, thereby facilitating the formation of finite-momentum FFLO pairs within the same band and resulting in the emergence of a topologically nontrivial superfluid. This targeted control of intraband FFLO pairing paves the way for new strategies in the manipulation of superfluid phases in spin-orbit coupled systems and offers essential insights for experimental realizations in ultracold atomic gases, with implications for topological quantum computing and Majorana fermions."}

We investigate the possibility of geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on boundary absorbing regions. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics and life sciences."}

The discussion that followed has emphasized a basic point: writing down coordinate maps is not the same thing as providing a physical theory. In particular, quantum superposition is not operationally defined by drawing multiple paths on paper: it is defined by what happens when alternatives recombine in an interference loop [2, 3]. In parallel, careful 1+1 analyses have clarified how sign conventions and time-orientation choices enter the superluminal formulas [4]. Finally, tachyonic QFT proposals suggest a possible mathematical bridge via an enlarged (twin) Hilbert space [5], although this proposal remains contested (e.g., on commutator covariance and microcausality grounds) [6]. The aim of this short note is organizational. We keep three layers separate: (K) kinematics (which maps exist and what they preserve), (O) operational content (what an experiment must actually reproduce, especially closed-loop interference), and (D/B) dynamics and bridges (how amplitudes and probabilities are generated, and how subluminal and superluminal sectors might be linked).

A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation.

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms."}

Aiming to unveil the mechanism behind the onset of incommensurate charge order in layered materials, we study a half-filled, four-band tight-binding model on a ladder with a relative shift $δ=p/q$ between the legs, induced by the dimerization of one of them. The shift results in a moiré supercell comprising q composite cells and a modulated inter-leg tunneling. The moiré potential compresses the leg bands into flat minibands near the Fermi level, resulting in additional low-energy peaks in the density of states. Including Coulomb interactions, we find an incommensurate charge-density-wave phase in which the charge modulation is out of phase between the legs. The collective excitations of this state are long-lived neutral, acoustic phasons whose speed is controlled by the moiré parameter $δ$ and the inter-leg tunneling amplitude.

To demonstrate the topological contribution to the (spin) magnetoelectric polarizability, we compute the magnetoelectric polarizability microscopically for two distinct minimal lattice models: a spin-orbit coupled Néel antiferromagnet and a spin-orbit-free noncollinear antiferromagnet with double-$Q$ spin order. We show that the topological origin of the revealed magnetoelectric effect can be traced back to the electromagnetic response of topological semimetals in two dimensions, and hence is ultimately governed by a strong topological invariant in one dimension. Given this dimensional hierarchy, we further consider two minimal lattice models in one dimension, both one-dimensional variants of the 2D lattice models, and show that the magnetoelectric polarizability exhibits a clear signature of nontrivial crystalline topology.

Background radiation has been shown to excite quasiparticles, but quasiparticles are observed even when the devices are carefully shielded.

This work presents a novel experimentally-feasible framework for continuous-variable quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) developed with available photonic components: coherent states as input encoding, a general Gaussian transformation followed by multi-mode photon subtractions as the processing layer, and homodyne detection as outputs readout. The closed-form expressions of such architecture are derived demonstrating the family of adaptive activations and the quantum-optical neurons that emerge from the amount of photon-subtracted modes, proving that the proposed design satisfies the Universal Approximation Theorem within a single layer. To classically simulate the QONN training, the high-performance QuaNNTO library has been developed based on Wick--Isserlis expansion and Bogoliubov transformations, allowing multi-layer exact expectation values of non-Gaussian states without truncating the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.

The lack of a full inversion symmetry allows the coupling of the charge current and spin density. In this paper we investigate this phenomenon when the in-plane rotational symmetry is lowered to the $C_{2v}$ and $C_{3v}$ symmetry groups, whereby the electron spectrum becomes anisotropic. We find that in the $C_{2v}$ case, depending on the ratio between the Rashba SOC strengths along the principal axes, the non-equilibrium spin density deviates notably from the $90^o$ degrees rotation, with respect to the applied electric field, familiar in the isotropic case. In the $C_{3v}$ case, when a warping cubic-in-momentum term is present, whereas the standard $90^o$ degrees rotation of the spin density remains, the spin-charge interconversion depends on the intensity of the warping itself. The microscopic theory takes into account disorder including vertex corrections, both via the diagrammatic implementation of the Kubo formula and via the quantum kinetic theory. We show that vertex corrections are crucial to capture the details of the inverse spin galvanic effect in contrast to previous treatments based on the constant broadening approximation."}

We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\\tt ibm\\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations.

Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano.

Motivated by this, we present an experimental realization of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using an analog simulator based on a single superconducting transmon qudit with up to $d = 9$ levels. This is accomplished by moving to a rotated frame in which evolution under any time-dependent local field and one-axis twisting can be realized by the application of multiple simultaneous drives. Combining this analog drive scheme with universal control and single-shot readout of the qudit state, we provide a detailed study of five finite-size precursors of quantum criticality in the LMG model: dynamical phase transitions, closing of the energy gap, Kibble-Zurek-like dynamics, statistics of the order parameter, and excited-state phase transitions. For each experiment we devise a protocol for extracting the relevant properties which does not require any prior knowledge of the system eigenstates, and can therefore be readily extended to higher dimensions or more complicated models. Our results cement high-dimensional transmon qudits as an exciting path towards simulating many-body physics."}

Quantum circuits employ superconducting elements at micro- and mesoscopic scales, where individual vortices can significantly impact device performance, necessitating investigation of vortex entry, motion, and pinning in these constrained geometries. Cavity-optomechanical platforms combining flux-tunable microwave resonators with superconducting nanomechanical elements offer a promising route to the single-photon strong-coupling regime and enable highly sensitive probing of the mechanical degree of freedom under elevated magnetic fields. Here, we exploit this platform to investigate vortex entry processes at the single-event level. We observe discrete jumps of the mechanical resonance frequency attributable to individual vortex entry, corresponding to attonewton-scale forces and allowing quantitative extraction of single-vortex pinning energies. These signatures are superimposed on a smooth power-law background characteristic of the collective Campbell-regime of vortex elasticity. Our results establish optomechanics-inspired sensing as a powerful method for exploring fundamental superconducting properties and identifying decoherence pathways in quantum circuits.

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms."}

Final doctoral thesis version containing modifications suggested by the referees: Marco G. Genoni, Madalin Guta, and Lukasz Cywinski", "summary": "Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic sensors to static or slowly varying fields. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis tools, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry. To address this, we apply concepts from continuous quantum measurements and estimation theory to optical atomic magnetometers, aiming to accurately model these devices, interpret their measurement data, control their dynamics, and achieve optimal sensitivity. Quantifying this optimal performance requires determining a fundamental quantum limit on sensitivity. We derive this limit, imposed by noise, and show that it scales at best linearly with sensing time and atom number N, ruling out any super-classical scaling. This limit is independent of the initial state, measurement, estimator, and measurement-based feedback, and depends only on the decoherence model and the strength of field fluctuations. Thus, finding an estimator that attains this bound proves the sensing strategy optimal. To approach this limit, we develop a quantum dynamical model scalable with N, based on a co-moving Gaussian approximation of the stochastic master equation, which includes measurement backaction and decoherence. This enables a real-time estimation and control architecture integrating an extended Kalman filter with a linear quadratic regulator. Simulating the magnetometer with our model and EKF+LQR strategy shows that quantum-limited tracking of constant and fluctuating fields is within reach of current atomic magnetometers. Our sensing strategy can also track biologically relevant signals, such as heartbeat-like waveforms, and drive the atomic ensemble into an entangled state, even when the measurement record is used for feedback but later discarded."}

Starting from a microscopic Lagrangian for a relativistic electron beam coupled to a single radiation mode, we construct a Keldysh functional integral, perform the large-N rescaling, and integrate out the electronic degrees of freedom. This yields an effective action for the FEL mode in which dispersion, gain, and noise are all generated by a single electronic self-energy built from the current correlations of the beam. For a stationary Gaussian beam, we obtain closed analytic expressions for the retarded and Keldysh components of the self-energy, which directly encode frequency pulling, gain reduction due to energy spread, and the noise spectrum experienced by the field. At low frequency, the theory reduces to a Landau-Ginzburg-Keldysh description of a single complex mode with a mass, growth rate, nonlinearity, and noise strength fully determined by beam current, energy spread, and detuning. In this framework, the FEL threshold appears as a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition in the laser universality class: the coherent field amplitude plays the role of an order parameter, while the amplitude of critical fluctuations is fixed by the microscopic noise kernel. The result is a minimal open quantum field theory analog of Vlasov-Maxwell FEL theory, in which gain, dispersion, and noise arise from a unified self-energy framework rather than from separate phenomenological ingredients."}

Our work combines room-temperature randomized benchmarking with a new class of composite pulses that are simultaneously robust to frequency and amplitude, affecting random and systematic errors.

For single-qubit and two-qubit CNOT gate demonstrations in a solid-state nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, we systematically measure an improvement in the error per gate up to a factor of 9. By projecting the application of PUDDING to cryogenic temperatures we show a record two-qubit error per gate of $1.2 \\times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a fidelity of $99.9988\\%$, far below the thresholds required by surface and color code error correction.

In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Our algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Classical simulation for fidelity estimation shows that our algorithm enjoys much stronger robustness than [HKP20] under adversarial noise. Finally, based on a reduction from full-state tomography to shadow tomography, we prove that for rank $r$ states, both the near-optimal asymptotic error of $\\varepsilon=\\tilde{O}(γ\\sqrt{r})$ and copy complexity $\\tilde{O}(dr^2/\\varepsilon^2)=\\tilde{O}(dr/γ^2)$ can be achieved for adversarially robust state tomography, closing the large gap in [ABCL25] where optimal error can only be achieved using pseudo-polynomial number of copies in $d$."}

The latter uses an observation process produced by a measuring apparatus from the quantum output field of the memory system. The underlying system is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator whose Heisenberg evolution is governed by linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The controller is organised as a classical linear time-varying system, so that the resulting closed-loop system has quantum and classical dynamic variables. We apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing at the level of the first two moments and consider controllers with a separation structure which involve a continuously updated estimate for the initial quantum variables. The initial-point smoother is used for actuator signal formation so as to minimise the sum of a mean-square deviation of the quantum memory system variables at a given time horizon from their initial values and an integral quadratic penalty on the control signal."}

However, when quantum information is encoded in bosonic systems, this connection becomes subtler: as negativity is only a necessary property for potential quantum advantage, encoding (i.e., physical) states may exhibit large negativities while still corresponding to architectures that remain classically simulable. Several frameworks have attempted to relate non-negativity of states and gates in the computational phase space to non-negativity of processes in the physical bosonic phase space, but a consistent correspondence remains elusive. Here, we introduce a general framework that connects the physical phase space structure of bosonic systems to their encoded computational representations across arbitrary dimensions and encodings. This framework highlights the key role of the reference frame-equivalently, the choice of vacuum-in defining the computational basis and linking its phase space simulability properties to those of the physical system.

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms."}

Existing randomness analysis lacks rigorous adversarial models and a clear characterization of the role of quantum coherence in these systems. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum information-theoretic framework for randomness generation in spontaneous emission processes. We characterize two distinct eavesdropping strategies: one where the adversary directly accesses the atom ensemble, and the other where the adversary accesses only its purification. Our analysis reveals that when randomness is generated through single-photon detection and temporal mode measurements, the QRNG is vulnerable to the first adversary scenario, though it still guarantees a lower bound on intrinsic randomness against the second adversary scenario even under maximal information leakage from the atoms. In contrast, QRNGs based on spatial mode detection and phase fluctuations demonstrate security against both types of adversaries, providing robust randomness generation. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative calculation of intrinsic randomness for these spontaneous-emission-based QRNG schemes."}

We introduce and analyze assisted quantum erasure, where correlations with a remote system reduce the energetic cost of resetting a memory. We identify exclusive control of erasure as the central operational requirement: only a designated party should be able to achieve the minimal cost, while any adversary necessarily fails. In the device-dependent regime, we show that entanglement of formation exactly characterizes exclusivity, establishing entanglement as the decisive thermodynamic resource. Moving to a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which only the memory holder's device is trusted, we develop an operational erasure protocol based on random dephasing and conditional operations. These results elevate quantum erasure from a thermodynamic constraint to an operational primitive: the erasure work cost quantifies secure, exclusive control over quantum memory, guaranteeing that an unauthorized agent cannot fully erase information under bounded work."}

Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schrödinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method."}

Existing multi-time frameworks, such as process matrices, allow for an arbitrary sequence of operations to be applied on a general process, but are restricted to interventions at discrete times and cannot represent measurements of finite duration. We introduce a continuous-time extension of multi-time quantum processes based on process and operation functionals, which generalize the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and yield a continuous Born rule that cleanly separates processes from operations. This framework provides a consistent representation of non-Markovian dynamics under continuous monitoring and leads to a natural definition of Markovianity in continuous time. We illustrate the formalism by analyzing continuous measurements in a generalized Caldeira-Leggett model, demonstrating its applicability to realistic non-Markovian scenarios."}

Although narrowband techniques can probe specific resonances with high precision, a broadband spectroscopic approach captures the full spectrum of defect properties and dynamics. Two-level system (TLS) defects in amorphous dielectrics are a particularly important example because they are major sources of decoherence and energy loss in superconducting quantum devices. However, accessing and characterizing their collective dynamics remains far more challenging than probing individual TLS defects. Building on our previously developed Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) technique, we study the coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a wide frequency range of 3-5 GHz without requiring full device fabrication, revealing quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. The spectral response reveals distinct V-shaped structures corresponding to the bare eigenmode frequencies. Using these features, we extract a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz^-1 for a silicon sample, across a 4.1-4.6 GHz span. Furthermore, we systematically investigate amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes for multiple temperatures and inter-pulse delays, providing direct evidence of coherent dynamics and control. A driven minimal spin model with dipole-dipole interactions that qualitatively capture the observed behavior is presented. Our results establish BCTDS as a versatile platform for broadband defect spectroscopy, offering new capabilities for diagnosing and mitigating sources of decoherence, engineering many-body dynamics, and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena in disordered quantum systems."}

With the overlap index and the entropy localization length, we classify mixed eigenstates and show that the contribution from dynamical tunneling scales as $\\sim \\hbar\\, \\exp(-b/\\hbar)$, with $b>0$ associated with the relative size of the regular region. The dominant fraction of states that remain sticky to the boundaries, referred to as sticky eigenstates, scales as $\\hbar^{1/2}$ in the MUPO case and oscillates around this algebraic behavior in the quasi-periodic case. This behavior generalizes established predictions for hierarchical states in KAM systems, which scale as $\\hbar^{1 - 1/γ}$, with $γ$ set by the corresponding classical stickiness reflected in the algebraic decay of cumulative RTDs $t^{-γ}$. For the piecewise-linear maps studied here, $γ= 2$. These results reveal a clear quantum signature of classical stickiness in non-KAM systems."}

Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer."}

Glazov1"], "title": "Boltzmann transport theory of magnon-exciton drag", "comment": null, "summary": "We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems."}
