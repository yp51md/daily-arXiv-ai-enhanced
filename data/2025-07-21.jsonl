This framework is used to study the effect of\ntemperature on the onset of inelasticity and fracture in amorphous\ntwo-dimensional silica glass approaching quasistatic conditions under uniaxial\ntensile loading.

However, scaling these systems to millions of qubits for\npractical applications poses substantial challenges, particularly due to\ninterconnect bottlenecks. To address this challenge, extensive research has\nfocused on developing cryogenic multiplexers that enable minimal wiring between\nroom-temperature electronics and quantum processors. This paper investigates\nthe viability of commercial microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches for\ncryogenic multiplexers in large-scale quantum computing systems. DC and RF\ncharacteristics of the MEMS switches are evaluated at cryogenic temperatures (<\n10 K) through finite element simulations and experimental measurements. Our\nresults demonstrate that MEMS switches exhibit improved on-resistance, lower\noperating voltage, and superior RF performance at cryogenic temperatures, with\nreliable operation over 100 million cycles. Furthermore, stable single-pole\nfour-throw (SP4T) switching and logical operations, including NAND and NOR\ngates, are demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures, validating their potential\nfor quantum computing.

In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in\none-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of\narea-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical\nbulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime\n\\textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state\nensemble living on its temporal \\textit{boundary}. Building on this\ncorrespondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical\nphases using Gaussian adaptive circuits. They are designed to prepare and\nstabilize free-fermion topological states as their steady states in\n\\textit{any} spatial dimension. While circuits with exponentially local\noperations can stabilize a single topological steady state, those with\nfinite-range operations can reach a topological steady-state ensemble. As a\ndemonstration, we explicitly construct and simulate 2+1d adaptive circuits that\nrealize mEO-class-A topological dynamics. We show that the finite-range\nversions converge to an ensemble of Chern insulators in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\ncircuit depth. We numerically study the topological phase transitions and\ndynamical domain-wall modes between different topological dynamical phases in\nthis symmetry class. We also analyze the robustness of our adaptive circuit\nprotocol to coherent noise."}

The objective\nis for each broker to share a unique piece of information with all others\nsimultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, this protocol enables a fully\nparallel, single-step communication exchange among all brokers, regardless of\ntheir physical locations. A key feature of this protocol is its ability to\nensure both the anonymity and privacy of all participants are preserved,\nmeaning no broker can discern the identity of the sender behind any received\ninformation. At its core, the Quantum Dining Information Brokers Problem serves\nas a conceptual framework for achieving anonymous, untraceable, and massively\nparallel information exchange in a distributed system. The proposed protocol\nintroduces three significant advancements. First, while quantum protocols for\none-to-many simultaneous information transmission have been developed, this is,\nto the best of our knowledge, one of the first quantum protocols to facilitate\nmany-to-many simultaneous information exchange. Second, it guarantees complete\nanonymity and untraceability for all senders, a critical improvement over\nsequential applications of one-to-many protocols, which fail to ensure such\nrobust anonymity. Third, leveraging quantum entanglement, the protocol operates\nin a fully distributed manner, accommodating brokers in diverse spatial\nlocations. This approach marks a substantial advancement in secure, scalable,\nand anonymous communication, with potential applications in distributed\nenvironments where privacy and parallelism are paramount."}

Here, we\ninvestigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries,\nnamely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN)\napproaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the\neffective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by\nexpectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic\napproach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical\nalgebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all\nthree formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that\nthese three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished\nby sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two\napproaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including\nrelativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF\ntransformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the\nolder effective approach, by which it was inspired. As a physical application,\nwe explore the QRF covariance of uncertainties and fluctuations, which turn out\nto be frame-dependent. This is particularly well-suited for the effective and\nalgebraic approaches, for which these quantities form a natural basis. Finally,\nwe pave the way towards extending these two approaches to non-ideal QRFs by\nstudying the projection and gauge-fixing operations of the Page-Wootters\nformalism, built into the PN framework, on algebraic states."}

We show that this framework fails dramatically for mixed\ninitial states, evolved unitarily, even with infinitesimal initial mixedness.\nTo address this, we introduce a new paradigm of deep thermalisation for mixed\nstates, fundamentally distinct from that for pure-state ensembles. In our\nformulation, the deep thermal ensemble arises by tracing out auxiliary degrees\nof freedom from a maximum-entropy ensemble defined on an augmented system, with\nthe ensemble structure depending explicitly on the entropy of the initial\nstate. We demonstrate that such ensembles emerge dynamically in generic,\nlocally interacting chaotic systems. For the self-dual kicked Ising chain,\nwhich we show to be exactly solvable for a class of mixed initial states, we\nfind exact emergence of the so-defined mixed-state deep thermal ensemble at\nfinite times.

Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the\neffect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to\nenhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that\nare not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn,\na spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at\ntemperatures $\\le$2 K, $T_2\\sim1$ $\\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse\nsequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM)\noscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as\nhigh as $1.35$ $\\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence\npreservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields\n$T_2\\sim\\!2.8$ $\\mu$s at the CT and up to $\\sim\\!3.6$ $\\mu$s in the ESEEM\nregime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental\nvalues of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the\nmolecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much\nof the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules\nthemselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not\nonly field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency\nitself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a\ncombination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise\nin the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$.
