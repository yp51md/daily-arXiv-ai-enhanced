To this purpose, we establish a fruitful connection to non-Hermitian\nHamiltonians. The results for the phase diagram, stability boundaries, and\nrelevant observables are based on mean-field analysis, exact diagonalization,\nperturbation theory, and Keldysh field theory."}

Using the\ngeneralized Aubry-Andr\\'e model, we show that the mobility edges play a key\nrole in manipulating long-range indirect interactions in these systems. Near\nthe mobility edge, critical states exhibit unexpectedly strong correlations\nbetween sites that share similar local structures, regardless of their spatial\nseparation. Remarkably, by tuning the mobility edge across the Fermi level, one\ncan induce both adiabatic transport and abrupt switching of entanglement\nbetween distant sites. These results highlight the potential of aperiodic\nstructures for controlling nonlocal quantum correlations, opening new avenues\nfor entanglement-based applications in quasiperiodic systems."}

We contrast this motion with the\nmotion of a quantum particle in a potential which varies randomly in space and\nin time, which could also be thought of as (possibly thermal) noise. We\ncalculate expectations of observables both linear and nonlinear in the density\nmatrix. We demonstrate explicitly that while linear observables cannot\ndistinguish between random measurements and random noise, measurable\ndistinctions can be seen in nonlinear observables."}

These modes, which we term algebraic states in continuum (AICs),\ndecay algebraically as $1/|r|$ from the impurity site, and their energies lie\nwithin the bulk continuum spectrum under periodic boundary conditions. We\nanalytically derive the threshold condition for the impurity strength required\nto generate such states. Remarkably, AICs are forbidden in Hermitian systems\nand in 1D non-Hermitian systems, making them unique to non-Hermitian systems in\ntwo and higher dimensions. To detect AICs, we introduce a local density of\nstates as an experimental observable, which is readily accessible in\nphotonic/acoustic platforms."}

This phenomenon has\nrecently been observed experimentally in an ion trap that simulates a\nlong-range spin chain. However, the underlying mechanism of the QME in the\npresence of long-range interactions remains unclear. Using the time-dependent\nspin-wave theory, we investigate the dynamical restoration of the\nspin-rotational symmetry and the QME in generic long-range spin systems. We\nshow that quantum fluctuations of the magnetization drive the restoration of\nsymmetry by melting the initial ferromagnetic order and are responsible for the\nQME. We find that this effect occurs across a wide parameter range in\nlong-range systems, in contrast to its absence in some short-range\ncounterparts."}
