### [1] [Universal framework with exponential speedup for the quantum simulation of quantum field theories including QCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18966)
*Jad C. Halimeh,Masanori Hanada,Shunji Matsuura*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种适用于包括量子色动力学（QCD）在内的广泛量子系统的量子模拟框架，通过推广高效协议并应用Jordan-Wigner和Verstraete-Cirac变换，实现了指数级加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为广泛量子系统（尤其是包含玻色子和费米子的系统）提供高效的量子模拟方法，克服现有方案的资源限制。

Method: 推广了玻色子理论的高效量子模拟协议，结合Jordan-Wigner和Verstraete-Cirac变换，应用于QCD的轨道格点形式化。

Result: 在QCD模拟中实现了指数级加速，并简化了量子电路设计，展示了明确的资源估算。

Conclusion: 该框架无需假设预言机，提供了可直接在量子计算机上实现的具体构造，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We present a quantum simulation framework universally applicable to a wide
class of quantum systems, including quantum field theories such as quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). Specifically, we generalize an efficient quantum
simulation protocol developed for bosonic theories in [Halimeh et al.,
arXiv:2411.13161] which, when applied to Yang-Mills theory, demonstrated an
exponential resource advantage with respect to the truncation level of the
bosonic modes, to systems with both bosons and fermions using the Jordan-Wigner
transform and also the Verstraete-Cirac transform. We apply this framework to
QCD using the orbifold lattice formulation and achieve an exponential speedup
compared to previous proposals. As a by-product, exponential speedup is
achieved in the quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian, the
latter being a special limit of the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian. In the case
of Hamiltonian time evolution of a theory on an $L^d$ spatial lattice via
Trotterization, one Trotter step can be realized using $\mathcal{O}(L^d)$
numbers of CNOT gates, Hadamard gates, phase gates, and one-qubit rotations. We
show this analytically for any matter content and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge group
with any $N$. Even when we use the Jordan-Wigner transform, we can utilize the
cancellation of quantum gates to significantly simplify the quantum circuit. We
also discuss a block encoding of the Hamiltonian as a linear combination of
unitaries using the Verstraete-Cirac transform. Our protocols do not assume
oracles, but rather present explicit constructions with rigorous resource
estimations without a hidden cost, and are thus readily implementable on a
quantum computer.

### [2] [Nonstabilizerness and Error Resilience in Noisy Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18976)
*Fabian Ballar Trigueros,José Antonio Marín Guzmán*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究噪声对量子优势关键资源——非稳定性的影响，发现非单位通道（如振幅阻尼）可增强魔法性，而退极化噪声则不能。解码保真度与非稳定性的转变不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨噪声如何影响量子系统中的非稳定性，以探索噪声在量子信息处理中的潜在利用价值。

Method: 通过研究多体量子比特系统中噪声（如振幅阻尼和退极化噪声）对非稳定性的影响，并分析编码-解码协议中的表现。

Result: 振幅阻尼噪声可增强非稳定性，而退极化噪声则不能；解码保真度与非稳定性的转变不一致。

Conclusion: 噪声可能被利用而非仅被抑制，为量子信息处理提供新思路。

Abstract: We investigate how noise impacts nonstabilizerness - a key resource for
quantum advantage - in many-body qubit systems. While noise typically degrades
quantum resources, we show that amplitude damping, a nonunital channel, can
generate or enhance magic, whereas depolarizing noise provably cannot. In an
encoding-decoding protocol, we find that, unlike in the coherent case, a sharp
decoding fidelity transition does not match a transition in nonstabilizerness.
Our results point toward the possibility of leveraging, rather than merely
mitigating, noise for quantum information processing.

Abstract: Neutral atom technologies have opened the door to novel theoretical advances
in surface-code protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC),
offering a compelling alternative to lattice surgery by leveraging transversal
gates. However, a crucial gap remains between the theory of FTQC and its
practical realization on neutral atom systems; most critically, a key
theoretical requirement -- that syndrome extraction must be performed
frequently enough to keep error accumulation below a threshold constant -- is
difficult to satisfy in a scalable manner in conventional zoned approach. In
this work, we develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that closes such a
gap, bridging theoretical advances in surface-code fault-tolerant protocols
with capabilities of neutral atoms. Building on the "game of surface code"
framework originally developed for superconducting qubits, we introduce an
alternative game-based paradigm for transversal-gate FTQC that harnesses the
unique strengths of neutral atom arrays. The game rules are designed to enable
syndrome extraction at any intermediate step during logical gate
implementation, ensuring compatibility with the threshold theorem. We further
present an efficient method for designing resource state factories tailored to
transversal-gate FTQC. As an application, our framework offers a systematic
methodology and high-level abstraction for resource estimation and
optimization, demonstrating that space-time performance competitive with a
baseline lattice-surgery-based approach on superconducting qubits is possible,
even when physical operations on neutral atoms are orders of magnitude slower.
These results establish a solid foundation that bridges the theory and
experiment of FTQC powered by neutral atoms, charting a well-founded pathway
toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers and setting practical
directions for technological development.

### [4] [Fundamental Scaling Limit in Critical Quantum Metrology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19003)
*Ju-Yeon Gyhm,Hyukjoon Kwon,Myung-Joong Hwang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文研究了临界量子计量学中参数估计精度的基本限制，发现相位空间轨迹的绕数决定了量子Fisher信息的缩放界限，并提出了一种时间依赖控制方法以实现最优缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临界量子计量学利用量子相变附近的临界特性提高参数估计精度，但临界减速限制了有限时间内可达到的精度。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析系统相位空间轨迹的绕数，建立了量子Fisher信息的缩放界限，并提出了一种时间依赖控制方法。

Result: 研究发现，量子Fisher信息可以实现指数缩放，但需要增加绕数以匹配总演化时间。即使在未达到临界点或存在热耗散时，指数缩放仍然有效。

Conclusion: 本文为临界量子计量学提供了新的理论框架，展示了如何通过控制绕数实现最优参数估计精度。

Abstract: Critical quantum metrology aims to harness critical properties near quantum
phase transitions to enhance parameter estimation precision. However, critical
slowing down inherently limits the achievable precision within a finite
evolution time. To address this challenge, we establish a fundamental scaling
limit of critical quantum metrology with respect to the total evolution time.
We find that the winding number of the system's phase space trajectory
determines the scaling bound of quantum Fisher information. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the exponential scaling of the quantum Fisher information can
be obtained, and for this, it is necessary to increase the winding number by
the total evolution time. We explicitly construct a time-dependent control to
achieve optimal scaling from a simple on-off scheme depending on the system's
phase and discuss its topological nature. We highlight that such an exponential
scaling of quantum Fisher information remains valid even without reaching the
critical point and in the presence of thermal dissipation, albeit with a
decreased exponent.

Result: 发现双稳态和正常态两种相，少数自旋岛以恒定速度被周围吸收。

Conclusion: 模型在双稳态相中表现出非遍历性，量子与热涨落在线性阶独立作用。

Abstract: In this work we study the dissipative quantum North-East-Center (NEC) model:
a two-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice subject to chiral, kinetically constrained
dissipation and coherent quantum interactions. This model combines kinetic
constraints and chirality at the dissipative level, implementing local
incoherent spin flips conditioned by an asymmetric majority-vote rule. Through
a cluster mean-field approach, we determine the steady-state phase diagram of
the NEC model under different Hamiltonians, consistently revealing the
emergence of two distinct phases, bistable and normal, across all cases
considered. We further investigate the stability of the steady-state with
respect to inhomogeneous fluctuations in both phases, showing the emergence of
instabilities at finite wavevectors in the proximity of the phase transition.
Next, we study the nonergodicity of the model in the bistable phase. We
characterize the dynamics of minority islands of spins surrounded by a large
background of spins pointing in the opposite direction. We show that in the
bistable phase, the minority islands are always reabsorbed by the surrounding
at a constant velocity, irrespectively of their size. Finally, we propose and
numerically benchmark an equation of motion for the reabsorption velocity of
the islands where thermal and quantum fluctuations act independently at linear
order.

Abstract: Photonic implementations of unitary processes on lattice structures, such as
quantum walks, have been demonstrated across various architectures. However,
few platforms offer the combined advantages of scalability, reconfigurability,
and the ability to simulate dynamics on lattices with periodic boundary
conditions, such as cyclic or toroidal geometries. Here, we employ a recently
developed platform that enables the implementation of arbitrary translationally
invariant unitary operations on one- and two-dimensional lattices, and
demonstrate a natural mechanism for introducing periodic boundary conditions.
Our approach leverages direct access to the reciprocal lattice, where discrete
sampling of the unitary evolution effectively enforces the desired topology. We
program our platform to realize quantum walks on 1D cyclic lattices and 2D
lattices with cylindrical or toroidal topologies. The lattice size can be
readily tuned by adjusting the sampling density in reciprocal space. By
controlling reciprocal-space occupancy, we investigate the dynamics of
localized states and wavepackets, observing refocusing behavior, breathing
modes modulated by reciprocal-space discretizations, and wavepacket
trajectories that reflect the underlying topology. We further demonstrate a
form of dimensional reduction by mapping a 2D quantum walk on a cylinder to a
1D walk with a high-dimensional coin. These results establish a versatile
platform for realizing a broad class of optical mode transformations within
bounded Hilbert spaces.

### [7] [Revealing Hidden Non n-Locality In n-Local Star Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19026)
*Kaushiki Mukherjee,Biswajit Paul*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了星形n-局域网络中通过滤波操作利用非n-局域性的方法，发现非可分多量子比特滤波器的优势。


<details>

Motivation: 探索量子非经典性在可扩展网络中的表现，特别是在星形n-局域网络中非n-局域性的特性。

Method: 通过引入滤波操作和随机局域操作辅助经典通信（SLOCC），构建序列n-局域网络以生成非n-局域关联。

Result: 发现非可分多量子比特滤波器在星形网络中具有优势，且Bell-CHSH非局域性并非必要条件。

Conclusion: 星形网络的特定拓扑结构使得非可分滤波器表现出独特优势，这在Bell场景中无法体现。

Abstract: Keeping pace with technological advancement, in the past decade, use of
scalable networks have extended the study of quantum non-classicality beyond
the regime of Bell-CHSH nonlocality. Present work provide characterization of
non n-locality that can be exploited by incorporating filtering operations in
star-shaped n-local networks. This in turn provide a framework of sequential
n-local networks capable of generating non n-local correlations by involving
some suitable form of stochastic local operations assisted with classical
communications(SLOCC). It is observed that for effectiveness of such sequential
networks, Bell-CHSH nonlocality(upto SLOCC operations) of every individual
two-qubit state, distributed in the network, is not mandatory. However, there
does not exist any separable local filter, which when applied in n-local
network involving only Bell local states(upto SLOCC operations), can reveal non
n-locality. Interestingly, instances revealing advantage of nonseparable
mutli-qubit local filters over separable mutli-qubit local filters(by central
node) are obtained. Such an advantage is attributable to the specific topology
of star-shaped n-local networks and thus can never be reflected in Bell
scenario.

Motivation: 研究光纤隔离器在特定激光参数下的脆弱性，以揭示现有安全分析的不足。

Method: 通过暴露1550纳米光纤隔离器于17毫瓦平均功率的1061纳米皮秒攻击脉冲，以及1160毫瓦亚纳秒脉冲照射，测试其隔离性能。

Result: 攻击导致隔离性能降至安全阈值以下，且亚纳秒脉冲会永久性降低1550纳米隔离性能。

Conclusion: 当前安全分析未涵盖此类威胁，需进一步改进以应对潜在攻击。

Abstract: Quantum key distribution systems offer cryptographic security, provided that
all their components are thoroughly characterised. However, certain components
might be vulnerable to a laser-damage attack, particularly when attacked at
previously untested laser parameters. Here we show that exposing 1550-nm
fiber-optic isolators to 17-mW average power, 1061-nm picosecond attacking
pulses reduces their isolation below a safe threshold. Furthermore, the
exposure to 1160-mW sub-nanosecond pulsed illumination permanently degrades
isolation at 1550 nm while the isolators maintain forward transparency. These
threats are not addressed by the currently-practiced security analysis.

Conclusion: 广义麦克斯韦关系为量子模拟器和复杂材料研究提供了一种通用且实用的工具。

Abstract: Quantum simulators hold enormous promise for advancing the modelling of
materials and understanding emergent physics, such as high temperature
superconductivity and topological order. While correlation functions are,
typically, straightforward to measure in quantum simulators, thermodynamic
properties are not. This limits our ability to directly compare the results of
quantum simulations to experiments on the materials being modelled. Maxwell
relations are an extremely powerful tool for characterising complex materials,
as they enable the determination of challenging-to-measure thermodynamic
properties from more accessible ones. Here, we introduce generalised Maxwell
relations that relate every thermodynamic quantity to a single local
correlation function. We illustrate their utility by deducing the thermodynamic
properties of several iconic quantum many-body models from pair correlation
functions using the generalised Maxwell relations. We show that this
{universal} approach is readily accessible in quantum simulators and suggest
applications to condensed matter systems where thermodynamic measurements are
challenging, such as atomically thin materials.

Conclusion: 该研究首次在集成硅光子器件中实现了时间-频率双域超纠缠，为量子通信网络提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional entangled photon states represent an important resource in
quantum communication networks. Specifically, hyperentangled states presenting
simultaneous entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DoF), stand out for
their noise resilience and information capacity. In this work, we demonstrate
the generation of hyperentangled photon pairs in the time and frequency-bin
domain by spontaneous four-wave mixing from the coherent driving of two
integrated Silicon microresonators. We demonstrate entanglement in each DoF by
proving the violation of the Clauser Horne Shimony Holt (CHSH) inequality by
more than 27 standard deviations (STDs) in each reduced space. Genuine
hyperentanglement is then assessed from the negativity of an hyperentanglement
witness, which is verified by more than 60 STDs. These results mark, to the
best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of time-frequency bin
hyperentanglement in an integrated silicon photonic device.

Abstract: Using a Hamiltonian of physical interest, we show the existence of a unitary
transformation that drives the initial state of a two-qubit system to a

that this process is robust to environmental noise. Our results provide
mathematical justification for our earlier computational experiments.

Conclusion: 量子力学为热化时间设定了基本限制，与普朗克时间和能隙密切相关。

Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum mechanics entails a fundamental lower bound on
the thermalization time $\tau$ of any system. At finite temperature, we show
that $\tau$ is bounded by half the Planckian dissipation time, $\tau \geq
\tau_{\rm Pl}/2$ with $\tau_{\rm Pl} = \hbar/(k_{\rm B} T)$. In the
low-temperature regime, our bound takes the form $\tau \geq \hbar / \Delta$
with $\Delta$ the spectral gap, in close connection with the quantum adiabatic
theorem. These bounds, rooted in Hamiltonian estimation, hold for arbitrary
quantum processes that output states close to the corresponding thermal
ensemble for a nontrivial class of Hamiltonians.

Result: 揭示了准BIC和精确BIC的谱极点的物理意义，并提出了精确BIC的通用判据。

Conclusion: 该理论为BIC的实现提供了新框架，适用于多领域应用。

Abstract: Bound state in the continuum (BIC) and quasi-BIC represent a remarkable class
of wave functions that disobey conventional intuition by exhibiting spatially
localized modes embedded in the continuum spectrum. In recent years, these
states have found important applications in interdisciplinary systems as a
non-radiating mode with ultra-long lifetime. In these applications, a key
question is how to convert a quasi-BIC into an exact BIC, and what the general
criterion is for this transition. In this work, we uncover its origin using two
steps in a two-band model with an arbitrary confining potential. Firstly, we
demonstrate that a bound state coupled to a continuum band can yield quasi-BIC.
Then, we show that tuning the coupling between the bands can convert the
quasi-BIC into an exact BIC. In our theory, the real and complex poles of the
spectra have a clear physical meaning for the quasi- and exact BICs, and we
give the general criterion for exact BICs. Unlike previous proposals, our
theory requires neither symmetry protection nor topological constraints and can
be extended to a multiband model, providing a new framework for realizing BICs
and offering new insights for their design in different fields, including
photonics, acoustics, ultracold atoms and Bose-Einstein condensate with and
without many-body interactions.

Abstract: Perturbation theory is used to investigate the evolution of the von Neumann
entropy of a subsystem of a bipartite quantum system in the course of a
gedanken scattering experiment. We find surprisingly simple criteria for the
initial state and the scattering matrix that guarantee that the subsystem
entropy increases. The class of states that meet these criteria are more
correlated than simple product states of the subsystems. They form a subclass
of the set of all separable states, and they can therefore be assembled by
classical processes alone.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantum entanglement and work extraction in two
distinct optomechanical systems. The first system consists of two spatially
separated Fabry-P\'erot cavities driven by squeezed light in the
resolved-sideband regime, while the second system comprises a laser field
incident on a vibrating mirror. We analyze the entanglement dynamics between
optical and mechanical modes, as well as quantum correlations in a mixed
optomechanical bipartite system (optic-optic mode) mediated by radiation
pressure. Using logarithmic negativity as a measure, we quantify the
entanglement evolution in both optic-optic and mirror-mirror bipartite
subsystems. Furthermore, we show how three distinct types of extractable work
vary with system parameters and examine their relationship with entanglement.
Our results highlight the relationship between quantum correlations and
extracted work in optomechanical system, offering insights for quantum
information processing and energy transfer in hybrid systems.

Conclusion: GFD纯度不仅揭示了资源性的特征，还具有操作意义，可用于资源性检测和态压缩性分析。

Abstract: In this work we present a general framework for studying the resourcefulness
in pure states for quantum resource theories (QRTs) whose free operations arise
from the unitary representation of a group. We argue that the group Fourier
decompositions (GFDs) of a state, i.e., its projection onto the irreducible
representations (irreps) of the Hilbert space, operator space, and tensor
products thereof, constitute fingerprints of resourcefulness and complexity. By
focusing on the norm of the irrep projections, dubbed GFD purities, we find
that low-resource states live in the small dimensional irreps of operator
space, whereas high-resource states have support in more, and higher
dimensional ones. Such behavior not only resembles that appearing in classical
harmonic analysis, but is also universal across the QRTs of entanglement,
fermionic Gaussianity, spin coherence, and Clifford stabilizerness. To finish,
we show that GFD purities carry operational meaning as they lead to
resourcefulness witnesses as well as to notions of state compressibility.

Abstract: We present a quantum computing approach for efficiently calculating the Berry
phase in topological Hamiltonians. Our method leverages cyclic adiabatic
evolution of the Hamiltonian and employs adaptive variational quantum
algorithms for state preparation and evolution, optimizing circuit efficiency
while maintaining high accuracy. We benchmark our approach on dimerized
Fermi-Hubbard chains with four sites, demonstrating precise Berry phase
simulations in both noninteracting and interacting regimes. Our results show
that circuit depths reach up to 106 layers for noninteracting systems and
increase to 279 layers for interacting systems due to added complexity.
Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our scheme across a wide range
of parameters governing adiabatic evolution and variational algorithm. These
findings highlight the potential of adaptive variational quantum algorithms for
advancing quantum simulations of topological materials and computing geometric
phases in strongly correlated systems.

Conclusion: 明确了不同描述中对称性的保持条件及其生成元的关系。

Abstract: We consider Markovian open quantum dynamics with weak unitary symmetries.
Starting from the quantum master equation for the system alone, it is known
that the joint dynamics of the system and its environment can be obtained by
dilation, leading to a closed dynamics for a continuous matrix product state.
Performing counting measurements on the environment gives rise to stochastic
dynamics of quantum trajectories for the system, which when averaged yield back
the quantum master equation. In this work, we identify necessary and sufficient
conditions under which the dynamics of these different descriptions retain the
weak symmetry of the quantum master equation and we characterise the resulting
symmetries of the different descriptions in terms of their generators. We find
that the joint dynamics always features a separable symmetry directly related
to that of the quantum master equation, but for quantum trajectories the
corresponding symmetry is present only if the counting measurement satisfies
certain conditions.

Result: 耦合效率β>80%，Purcell因子FP>10，但灰色激子和层间激子的低振荡强度是挑战。

Conclusion: 水平槽跑道谐振器可能克服低振荡强度问题，实现强耦合，但会牺牲波导的宽带特性。

Abstract: Horizontal slot waveguides are planar photonic structures with a guided mode
which is strongly polarized in the out-of-plane direction and tightly confined
in a sub-wavelength region of lower refractive index. We show through FDTD
simulations that this mode can lead to coupling efficiencies $\beta>80\%$ and
Purcell factors $F_P>10$ for some types of dark intralayer excitons in
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers -- more aplty named ``gray
excitons'', as their out-of-plane dipole does couple to adequately polarized
light -- as well as interlayer excitons in TMD heterostructures. These figures
indicate a path to the strong coupling regime for gray and interlayer excitons,
while bright excitons are poorly coupled to the slot mode and experience
Purcell suppression for $\lambda>\SI{1}{\micro\meter}$. A significant hurdle
towards strong coupling, however, is the low oscillator strengths of these two
excitonic species. We use the Tavis-Cummings model to show that a
horizontal-slot racetrack resonator can overcome this difficulty and reach a
cooperativity $C>>1$, albeit sacrificing the broadband characteristic of
waveguides.

Conclusion: 该算法可作为#P完全问题的启发式方法，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for approximately counting the number of
solutions to planar 2-satisfiability (2SAT) formulas natively on neutral atom
quantum computers. Our algorithm maps Boolean variables to atomic registers
arranged in space according to a given formula, so that 2SAT constraints are
enforced via the Rydberg blockade between neighboring atoms. A quench under
Rydberg dynamics of an initial computational basis state produces a
superposition of all solutions after a sufficiently long evolution. For almost
uniform superpositions, a polynomial number of measurements is enough to
estimate the solution count up to any constant multiplicative factor via
sampling based counting. We demonstrate numerically that this protocol leads to
almost uniform solution sampling in 1D and 2D grids and that it produces
accurate counts for 2SAT instances on punctured grids, suggesting its general
applicability as a heuristic for #P-complete problems.

Conclusion: 结论表明，高维HHGP码即使底层经典码缺乏宏观能量壁垒，仍可能具有宏观能量壁垒，为单次纠错提供了更强的理论支持。

Abstract: Single-shot error correction outperform conventional approaches by requiring
only one round of stabilizer measurements for decoding, even in the presence of
measurement errors. This capability relates to the confinement property of
codes, which provides an energy barrier lower bound. Earlier research
established a confinement property for higher-dimensional hypergraph product
(HHGP) codes (Quintavalle et al. 2021 PRX Quantum), resulting in an energy
barrier lower bound for these codes. In this work, we show an improved energy
barrier lower bound for HHGP codes with low-density parity-check (LDPC)
properties. This bound is derived by analyzing the structure of the logical
operators. Our bound exceeds results derived from confinement alone, and unlike
standard hypergraph product codes, these higher dimensional variants can
possess macroscopic energy barriers even when the underlying classical codes
lack this property. Specifically, our analysis shows that the energy barrier of
LDPC HHGP codes is lower bounded by the distance of the underlying classical
codes. This lower bound is tight if the underlying classical codes exhibit
system size-dependent distances but constant energy barriers, like 3D and 4D
toric codes.

Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising platforms for quantum sensing due to
their chemically tunable Hamiltonians, enabling tailored coherence properties
and interactions with external fields. However, electric field sensing remains
challenging owing to typically weak spin-electric coupling (SEC) and limited
directional sensitivity. Addressing these issues using heavy atoms exhibiting
strong atomic spin-orbit couplings (SOC) often compromises spin coherence
times. Here, we demonstrate coherent electric field sensing using a
photogenerated charge-transfer (CT) spin triplet state in the organic molecule
ACRSA (10-phenyl-10H,10' H-spiro\[acridine-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one). By
embedding electric field pulses within a Hahn echo sequence, we coherently
manipulate the spin triplet and extract both the magnitude and directional
dependence of its SEC. The measured SEC strength is approximately, comparable
to values reported in systems with strong atomic SOC, illustrating that heavy
atoms are not a prerequisite for electric-field sensitivity of spin states. Our
findings position organic CT triplets as chemically versatile and directionally
sensitive quantum sensors of E-fields that function without atomic-SOC-mediated
mechanisms.

Abstract: We numerically study the transport of Rydberg excitations in chains of
neutral atoms. We realize an effective flip-flop interaction using off-resonant
driving fields. By tuning the relative distances between atoms and applying
atom-selective detuning fields, we realize the perfect transport condition.
This condition enables the transfer of a single Rydberg excitation from one end
of the chain to the other, allowing the distribution of entanglement across the
chain at the quantum speed limit. Through numerical simulations, we identify
the set of control parameters that maximize the transport probability for
experimentally relevant parameters. We study the various competing trade-offs
involved in the hierarchy of approximations used to map the native Rydberg spin
model onto the effective model driving spin transport. Our results suggest that
entanglement can be distributed over chains of more than fifty atoms spanning
hundreds of microns at room temperature. This study informs the selection of
parameters for the experimental realization of perfect transport in Rydberg
chains, providing a new approach to distribute entanglement among distant atoms
in quantum processors.

Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance gyroscopes (NMRGs) employ noble-gas nuclear spins
as inertial sensors and alkali-metal atoms as in-situ magnetometers. Heavy
noble gases, particularly xenon, are widely used due to their large nuclear
spin and strong spin-exchange coupling with alkali-metal atoms. However, their
presence introduces additional collisional mechanisms that affect the
alkali-metal magnetic resonance linewidth, thereby influencing magnetometer
sensitivity and overall gyro performance. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework based on the density matrix formalism and master equation
approach to quantitatively study how xenon-induced two-body and three-body
interactions modify the linewidth of alkali-metal atoms under realistic NMRG
conditions. Our analysis reveals that Xe atoms primarily broaden the linewidth
via binary spindestruction collisions and van der Waals (vdW)-mediated
F-damping processes, while the effect of Xe nuclear polarization is negligible
at the ~1% level. We further demonstrate that nitrogen buffer gas plays a dual
role: it directly contributes to alkali-metal spin relaxation through binary
collisions and indirectly modulates vdW collision rates by altering molecular
lifetimes. The interplay between these processes leads to an optimal nitrogen
density that minimizes the linewidth. Additionally, we identify a temperature
threshold above which light-narrowing emerges, with this threshold increasing
alongside Xe density. These findings provide theoretical insight for optimizing
spin relaxation control in alkali-metal magnetometers and improving NMRG
performance.

Abstract: Detailed knowledge of the local environments of spin-defects in
semiconductors, such as nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond or divacancies
in silicon carbide, is crucial for optimizing control and entanglement
protocols in quantum sensing and information applications. However, a direct
experimental characterization of individual defect environments is not
scalable, as spin bath measurements are extremely time consuming. In this work,
we address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering the atomic positions and
hyperfine couplings of random nuclei surrounding spin-defects from sparse
experimental coherence signals, which can be obtained in hours. To address the
challenge to determine the number of isotopic nuclear spins along with their
hyperfine couplings, we employ a trans-dimensional Bayesian approach that
incorporates ab initio data. This approach provides posterior distributions of
the numbers, hyperfine couplings, and locations of nuclear spins present in the
sample. In addition to enabling high-throughput screening of spin-defects, we
demonstrate how this trans-dimensional Bayesian approach can guide experimental
design for dynamical decoupling experiments to detect nuclear spins within
targeted hyperfine coupling regimes. While the primary focus is on accelerating
spin-defect characterization, this Bayesian approach also lays the foundation
for digital twin studies of spin-defects, where a virtual model of the
spin-defect system evolves in real time with ongoing experimental measurements.
Together, the set of tools we designed and applied paves the way for scalable
deployment of spin-defects in semiconductors for quantum sensing and
information applications.

Abstract: While ideal lattice models have been widely used to study giant-atom-lattice
systems, they often neglect the disorder induced by defects during experimental
fabrication. This work systematically explores the dynamics of a giant atom
coupled to a disordered lattice characterized by random eigenfrequency
fluctuations. By analyzing atomic excitation probabilities, photon dynamics,
and energy spectra, we reveal that the system exhibits remarkable robustness
when disorder is confined within a specific range. The atomic excitation
probability remains stable, the lattice evolution process shows
reproducibility, and the energy spectrum structure is minimally distorted.
Notably, we introduce a quantitative parameter to measure non-Markovianity and
demonstrate that disorder significantly influences the system's memory effects.
These findings provide insights into the interplay between disorder,
non-Markovianity, and photon dynamics, with potential applications in quantum
information processing and the design of robust quantum devices.

Abstract: The generation and preservation of complex quantum states against
environmental noise are paramount challenges in advancing continuous-variable
(CV) quantum information processing. This paper introduces a novel framework
based on continuous-variable quantum diffusion principles, synergizing them
with CV quantum neural networks (CVQNNs) to address these dual challenges. For
the task of state generation, our Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion
Generative model (CVQD-G) employs a physically driven forward diffusion process
using a thermal loss channel, which is then inverted by a learnable,
parameter-efficient backward denoising process based on a CVQNN with
time-embedding. This framework's capability is further extended for state
recovery by the Continuous-Variable Quantum Diffusion Restoration model
(CVQD-R), a specialized variant designed to restore quantum states,
particularly coherent states with unknown parameters, from thermal degradation.
Extensive numerical simulations validate these dual capabilities, demonstrating
the high-fidelity generation of diverse Gaussian (coherent, squeezed) and
non-Gaussian (Fock, cat) states, typically with fidelities exceeding 99%, and
confirming the model's ability to robustly restore corrupted states.
Furthermore, a comprehensive complexity analysis reveals favorable training and
inference costs, highlighting the framework's efficiency, scalability, and its
potential as a robust tool for quantum state engineering and noise mitigation
in realistic CV quantum systems.

Conclusion: qPGA为量子机器学习提供了一种可扩展、抗噪声的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficiently embedding high-dimensional datasets onto noisy and low-qubit
quantum systems is a significant barrier to practical Quantum Machine Learning
(QML). Approaches such as quantum autoencoders can be constrained by current
hardware capabilities and may exhibit vulnerabilities to reconstruction attacks
due to their invertibility. We propose Quantum Principal Geodesic Analysis
(qPGA), a novel, non-invertible method for dimensionality reduction and
qubit-efficient encoding. Executed classically, qPGA leverages Riemannian
geometry to project data onto the unit Hilbert sphere, generating outputs
inherently suitable for quantum amplitude encoding. This technique preserves
the neighborhood structure of high-dimensional datasets within a compact latent
space, significantly reducing qubit requirements for amplitude encoding. We
derive theoretical bounds quantifying qubit requirements for effective encoding
onto noisy systems. Empirical results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10
show that qPGA preserves local structure more effectively than both quantum and
hybrid autoencoders. Additionally, we demonstrate that qPGA enhances resistance
to reconstruction attacks due to its non-invertible nature. In downstream QML
classification tasks, qPGA can achieve over 99% accuracy and F1-score on MNIST
and Fashion-MNIST, outperforming quantum-dependent baselines. Initial tests on
real hardware and noisy simulators confirm its potential for noise-resilient
performance, offering a scalable solution for advancing QML applications.

Abstract: Entanglement across distant frequency bands is a crucial resource in quantum
networking. However, directly entangling crossband photons, e.g. microwave and
optical, is challenging. Furthermore, distributing crossband entanglement via
direct quantum transduction is fundamentally limited, regardless of input
engineering with unconstrained source brightness. We propose to utilize
intraband entanglement to overcome such limits by a factor that scales up with
the input intraband entanglement brightness. The proposed protocol relies only
on off-the-shelf components and provides an advantage that is robust to a
substantial amount of loss.

Abstract: A recent influential result by Frenkel and Weiner establishes that in
presence of shared randomness (SR), any input-output correlation, with a
classical input provided to one party and a classical output produced by a
distant party, achievable with a d-dimensional quantum system can always be
reproduced by a d-dimensional classical system. In contrast, quantum systems
are known to offer advantages in communication complexity tasks, which consider
an additional input variable to the second party. Here, we show that, in
presence of SR, any one-way communication complexity protocol implemented using
a prime-dimensional quantum system can always be simulated exactly by
communicating a classical system of the same dimension, whenever quantum
protocols are restricted to stabilizer state preparations and stabilizer
measurements. In direct analogy with the Gottesman-Knill theorem in quantum
computation, which attributes quantum advantage to non-stabilizer (or magic)
resources, our result identifies the same resources as essential for realizing
quantum advantage in one-way communication complexity. We further present
explicit tasks where `minimal magic' suffices to offer a provable quantum
advantage, underscoring the efficient use of such resources in communication

Abstract: The simulation of ion-atom collisions remains a formidable challenge due to
the complex interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. We
present a hybrid quantum-classical computing framework for simulating
time-dependent ion-atom collision dynamics, within which two variational
quantum time evolution algorithms are implemented. To validate our framework,
we simulate the charge transfer dynamics and compute the corresponding cross
sections for the proton-hydrogen collision system across an energy range of
1--25~keV. Our results accurately reproduce the charge transfer dynamics with
high fidelity and exhibit very good agreement with available experimental and
theoretical cross section data across the entire energy range. These results
highlight the accuracy and applicability of our hybrid quantum-classical
framework for scattering cross section calculations. Our work demonstrates an
effective approach for mapping time-dependent many-body collision problems onto
near-term quantum computing devices, and also provides promising directions for
practical applications of universal quantum computing in the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种基于深度神经网络的量子态重构方法，改进了信息不完全场景下的量子层析成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息不完全的量子层析成像中，传统方法（如伪逆运算）效果有限，需要更高效且可扩展的重构方法。

Method: 1. 使用神经网络预测最优线性或二次重构器；2. 基于LSTM的序列化重构方法，可优化测量序列。

Result: 数值实验表明，两种方法在2-qubit和3-qubit系统中均优于标准最大似然估计。

Conclusion: 神经网络能有效学习多量子态几何结构，提升重构效率，且LSTM方法具有可扩展性。

Abstract: We revisit quantum tomography in an informationally incomplete scenario and
propose improved state reconstruction methods using deep neural networks. In
the first approach, the trained network predicts an optimal linear or quadratic
reconstructor with coefficients depending only on the collection of (already
taken) measurement operators. This effectively refines the undercomplete
tomographic reconstructor based on pseudoinverse operation. The second, based
on an LSTM recurrent network performs state reconstruction sequentially, thus
is scalable. It can also optimize the measurement sequence, which suggests a
no-free-lunch theorem for tomography: by narrowing the state space, we gain the
possibility of more efficient tomography by learning the optimal sequence of
measurements. Numerical experiments for a 2-qubit system show that both methods
outperform standard maximum likelihood estimation and also scale to larger
3-qubit systems. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively
learn the underlying geometry of multi-qubit states using this for their
reconstruction.

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has gathered
significant interest for its potential to achieve high secret key rates and
seamless integration with existing optical communication infrastructure.
State-of-the-art CV-QKD systems primarily use coherent states for simplicity.
However, squeezed states of light have been theoretically shown to offer
significant advantages, including higher secret key rates, greater resilience
to excess noise, and reduced requirements on information reconciliation
efficiency. In this work, we experimentally verify these theoretical
predictions and propose and demonstrate a practical squeezed-state CV-QKD
system based on modern local-local oscillator and digital-signal-processing
techniques. Operating over fibre channels and considering finite-size security
against collective attacks we showed the advantages of our system over its
coherent state counterpart. Our work paves the way for squeezed states to
become practical resources for quantum key distribution and other quantum
information protocols.

Result: 在噪声量子数据任务中表现优于量子卷积神经网络，在经典图像分类任务中性能接近经典神经网络。

Conclusion: IQFMs为解决当前量子增强机器学习的局限性提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning models that leverage quantum circuits as quantum
feature maps (QFMs) are recognized for their enhanced expressive power in
learning tasks. Such models have demonstrated rigorous end-to-end quantum
speedups for specific families of classification problems. However, deploying
deep QFMs on real quantum hardware remains challenging due to circuit noise and
hardware constraints. Additionally, variational quantum algorithms often suffer
from computational bottlenecks, particularly in accurate gradient estimation,
which significantly increases quantum resource demands during training. We
propose Iterative Quantum Feature Maps (IQFMs), a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that constructs a deep architecture by iteratively connecting shallow
QFMs with classically computed augmentation weights. By incorporating
contrastive learning and a layer-wise training mechanism, IQFMs effectively
reduces quantum runtime and mitigates noise-induced degradation. In tasks
involving noisy quantum data, numerical experiments show that IQFMs outperforms
quantum convolutional neural networks, without requiring the optimization of
variational quantum parameters. Even for a typical classical image
classification benchmark, a carefully designed IQFMs achieves performance
comparable to that of classical neural networks. This framework presents a
promising path to address current limitations and harness the full potential of
quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates Rabi transport and finite-size effects in
one-dimensional discrete-time topological quantum walks. We demonstrate the
emergence of localized states at boundaries between topologically distinct
phases and analyze how finite system sizes influence quantum walk dynamics. For
finite lattices, we show that topology induces localized and bilocalized
states, leading to Rabi-like transport as a result of degeneracy breaking due
to finite-size effects. The study bridges the gap between topological
protection and size-dependent dynamics, revealing transitions from ballistic
motion to localized or oscillatory behavior based on the system's topological
properties. Analytical and numerical methods are employed to explore the
spectra and dynamics of quantum walks, highlighting the robustness of Rabi
transport against disorder. The findings provide insights into controlled
quantum transport and potential applications in quantum information processing.

Abstract: A central challenge in developing practical quantum processors is maintaining
low control complexity while scaling to large numbers of qubits. Trapped-ion
systems excel in small-scale operations and support rapid qubit scaling via
long-chain architectures. However, their performance in larger systems is
hindered by spectral crowding in radial motional modes, a problem that forces
reliance on intricate pulse-shaping techniques to maintain gate fidelities.
Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a novel trapped-ion processor
with an individual-addressing system that generates steerable Hermite-Gaussian
beam arrays. The transverse gradient of these beams couples qubits selectively
to sparse axial motional modes, enabling to isolate a single mode as
entanglement mediator. Leveraging this capability, we demonstrate addressable
two-qubit entangling gates in chains up to six ions with fidelities
consistently around 0.97, achieved without complex pulse shaping. Our method
significantly reduces control overhead while preserving scalability, providing
a crucial advance toward practical large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing.

Conclusion: 该量子算法在因果集动力学研究中具有显著优势，为量子计算在量子引力领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer the potential for significant computational
advantages; however, in many cases, it remains unclear how these advantages can
be practically realized. Causal Set Theory is a discrete, Lorentz-invariant
approach to quantum gravity which may be well positioned to benefit from
quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithm that
investigates the dynamics of causal sets by sampling the space of causal sets,
improving on classical methods. Our approach builds on the quantum-enhanced
Markov chain Monte Carlo technique developed by Layden et al. [Nature 619, 282
(2023)], adapting it to sample from the constrained spaces required for
application. This is done by adding a constraint term to the Hamiltonian of the
system. A qubit Hamiltonian representing the Benincasa-Dowker action (the
causal set equivalent of the Einstein-Hilbert action) is also derived and used
in the algorithm as the problem Hamiltonian. We achieve a super-quadratic
quantum scaling advantage and, under some conditions, demonstrate a greater
potential compared to classical approaches than previously observed in
unconstrained QeMCMC implementations.

Result: 成功构建了多种量子密码原语，包括伪随机幺正、量子公钥加密等。

Conclusion: 量子iO具有强大的密码学潜力，研究为量子密码学提供了新的工具和方向。

Abstract: Indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) has emerged as a powerful cryptographic
primitive with many implications. While classical iO, combined with the
infinitely-often worst-case hardness of $\mathsf{NP}$, is known to imply
one-way functions (OWFs) and a range of advanced cryptographic primitives, the
cryptographic implications of quantum iO remain poorly understood. In this
work, we initiate a study of the power of quantum iO. We define several natural
variants of quantum iO, distinguished by whether the obfuscation algorithm,
evaluation algorithm, and description of obfuscated program are classical or
quantum. For each variant, we identify quantum cryptographic primitives that
can be constructed under the assumption of quantum iO and the infinitely-often
quantum worst-case hardness of $\mathsf{NP}$ (i.e., $\mathsf{NP} \not\subseteq
\mathsf{i.o.BQP}$). In particular, we construct pseudorandom unitaries, QCCC
quantum public-key encryption and (QCCC) quantum symmetric-key encryption, and
several primitives implied by them such as one-way state generators,
(efficiently-verifiable) one-way puzzles, and EFI pairs, etc. While our main
focus is on quantum iO, even in the classical setting, our techniques yield a
new and arguably simpler construction of OWFs from classical (imperfect) iO and
the infinitely-often worst-case hardness of $\mathsf{NP}$.

Abstract: Efficient quantum control is a cornerstone for the advancement of quantum
technologies, from computation to sensing and communications. Several
approaches in quantum control, e.g. optimal control and inverse engineering,
use the pulse amplitude and frequency shaping as the control tools. Often,
these approaches prescribe pulse shapes which are difficult or impossible to
implement. To this end, we develop the concept of isoprobability classes of
models of qubit dynamics, in which various pairs of time-dependent pulse
amplitude and frequency generate the same transition probability profile
(albeit different temporal evolutions toward this probability). In this manner,
we introduce an additional degree of freedom, and hence flexibility in qubit
control, as some models can be easier to implement than others. We demonstrate
this approach with families of isoprobability models, which derive from the
established Landau-Majorana-St\"uckelberg-Zener (LMSZ) and Allen-Eberly-Hioe
(AEH) classes. We demonstrate the isoprobability performance of these models on
an IBM Quantum processor. Instead of frequency (i.e. detuning) shaping, which
is difficult to implement on this platform, we exploit the time-dependent phase
of the driving field to induce an effective detuning. Indeed, the temporal
derivative of the phase function emulates a variable detuning, thereby
obviating the need for direct detuning control. The experimental validation of
the isoprobability concept with the time-dependent phase control underscores
the potential of this robust and accessible method for high-fidelity quantum
operations, paving the way for scalable quantum control in a variety of
applications.

Abstract: Distributed inner product estimation (DIPE) is a fundamental task in quantum
information, aiming to estimate the inner product between two unknown quantum
states prepared on distributed quantum platforms. Existing rigorous sample
complexity analyses are limited to unitary $4$-designs, which present practical
challenges for near-term quantum devices. This work addresses this challenge by
exploring DIPE with low-depth quantum circuits. We first establish that DIPE
with an arbitrary unitary $2$-design ensemble achieves an average sample
complexity of $\Theta(\sqrt{2^n})$, where $n$ is the number of qubits. We then
analyze ensembles below unitary $2$-designs -- specifically, the brickwork and
local unitary $2$-design ensembles -- showing average sample complexities of
$O(\sqrt{2.18^n})$ and $O(\sqrt{2.5^n})$, respectively. Furthermore, we analyze
the state-dependent variance for the brickwork and Clifford ensembles.
Remarkably, we find that DIPE with the global Clifford ensemble requires
$\Theta(\sqrt{2^n})$ copies for arbitrary state pairs, with its efficiency
further enhanced by the nonstabilizerness of the state pairs. Numerical
simulations with GHZ states and Haar random states up to $26$ qubits show that
low-depth circuit ensembles can match the performance of unitary $4$-designs in
practice. Our findings offer theoretically guaranteed methods for implementing
DIPE with experimentally feasible unitary ensembles.

Abstract: The classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has long served as a
cornerstone for modeling magnetization dynamics in magnetic systems, yet its
classical nature limits its applicability to inherently quantum phenomena such
as entanglement and nonlocal correlations. Inspired by the need to incorporate
quantum effects into spin dynamics, recently a quantum generalization of the
LLG equation is proposed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 266704 (2024)] which captures
essential quantum behavior in many-body systems. In this work, we develop a
robust numerical methodology tailored to this quantum LLG framework that not
only handles the complexity of quantum many-body systems but also preserves the
intrinsic mathematical structures and physical properties dictated by the
equation. We apply the proposed method to a class of many-body quantum spin
systems, which host topological states of matter, and demonstrate rich quantum
behavior, including the emergence of long-time entangled states. This approach
opens a pathway toward reliable simulations of quantum magnetism beyond
classical approximations, potentially leading to new discoveries.

Conclusion: 量子亚稳态DFS作为纠错资源具有潜力，但也存在局限性，需进一步策略优化。

Abstract: Open quantum systems governed by quantum master equations can exhibit quantum
metastability, where decoherence-free subspaces (DFS) remain approximately
invariant for long transient times before relaxing to a unique steady state. In
this work, we explore the use of such metastable DFS as code spaces for passive
quantum error correction. We focus on two representative models: a two-qubit
system under collective dissipation, and a nonlinear driven-dissipative Kerr
resonator. After characterizing the parameter regimes that support
metastability, we introduce and analyze a protocol for error recovery during
the metastable dynamics. Using spectral properties of the Liouvillian, we
characterize which types of errors can be possibly autonomously reversed. In
particular, we show that in the qubit model, the state affected by either
bit-flip error or spontaneous emission can be recovered up to a certain
measure. Instead, phase-flip errors would require further strategies. For the
bosonic system, we show that dephasing-induced errors on cat states can be
partially recovered, with a trade-off between fidelity and recovery time. These
findings highlight the limitations and capabilities of metastable DFS as a
transient resource for error correction.

Abstract: The construction of entangling gates with individual addressing capability
represents a crucial approach for implementing quantum computation in trapped
ion crystals. Conventional entangling gate schemes typically rely on laser beam
wave vectors to couple the ions' spin and motional degrees of freedom. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate an alternative method that employs a polarization
gradient field generated by a tightly focused laser beam, previously proposed
as a Magnus-type quantum logic gate. Using this technique, we perform Raman
operations on nuclear spin qubits encoded in 171Yb+ ions, generating
spin-dependent forces along axial motional modes in a linear trap. By utilizing
an acousto-optic deflector to create arbitrary spot pairs for individual ion
addressing in two-ion (four-ion) chains, we achieve MS gates with fidelities
exceeding 98.5% (97.2%). Further improvements in numerical aperture and laser
power could reduce gate durations while enhancing fidelity. This method is
compatible with, and can significantly simplify, optical tweezer gate
proposals, where motional mode engineering enables scalable trapped-ion quantum
computation. The technique can be extended to two-dimensional ion crystals,
representing a key step toward large-scale trapped-ion quantum processors.

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) refers to the task of optimizing a
black-box objective function using only a fixed set of prior input-output data,
without any active experimentation. Recent work has introduced quantum extremal
learning (QEL), which leverages the expressive power of variational quantum
circuits to learn accurate surrogate functions by training on a few data
points. However, as widely studied in the classical machine learning
literature, predictive models may incorrectly extrapolate objective values in
unexplored regions, leading to the selection of overly optimistic solutions. In
this paper, we propose integrating QEL with conservative objective models (COM)
- a regularization technique aimed at ensuring cautious predictions on
out-of-distribution inputs. The resulting hybrid algorithm, COM-QEL, builds on
the expressive power of quantum neural networks while safeguarding
generalization via conservative modeling. Empirical results on benchmark
optimization tasks demonstrate that COM-QEL reliably finds solutions with
higher true objective values compared to the original QEL, validating its
superiority for offline design problems.

Abstract: As information carriers for fault-tolerant quantum computing, systems
composed of anyons exhibit non-tensor product state spaces due to their
distinctive fusion rules, leading to fundamentally different entanglement
properties from conventional quantum systems. However, a quantitative
characterization of entanglement for general anyonic states remains elusive. In
this Letter, within the framework of resource theory, we propose three measures
that quantify total entanglement, conventional entanglement, and anyonic charge
entanglement (ACE), respectively. We demonstrate that total entanglement can be
decomposed into conventional entanglement and ACE, revealing distinct
entanglement structures in anyonic systems compared to those in conventional
quantum systems. We further illustrate a geometric interpretation of our ACE
measure and establish its equivalence to a previously proposed probe of ACE,
extending the known equivalence between the geometric interpretation and
operational significance of bipartite correlations. Our work broadens the
understanding of entanglement.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate cavity-free feedback cooling of the three
lowest-lying collective modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a prolate
harmonic trap. Using shadowgraph imaging as an \textit{in situ} probe of the
atomic density, we measure the time-dependent centers-of-mass and widths of the
condensate in two dimensions and use these measurements to damp oscillations in
the two visible dipole modes and the low-frequency quadrupole mode. By inducing
oscillations in the condensate, we show that we can efficiently damp the dipole

allows decoding to be simplified. The results are applicable to various

Abstract: Contextuality is a key feature of quantum mechanics, and identification of
noncontextual subtheories of quantum mechanics is of both fundamental and
practical importance. Recently, noncontextual Pauli Hamiltonians have been
defined in the setting of variational quantum algorithms. In this work we
rigorously establish a number of properties of noncontextual Pauli
Hamiltonians. We prove that these Hamiltonians can be composed of more Pauli
operators than diagonal Hamiltonians. This establishes that noncontextual
Hamiltonians are able to describe a greater number of physical interactions. We
then show that the eigenspaces admit an efficient classical description. We
analyse the eigenspace of these Hamiltonians and prove that for every
eigenvalue there exists an associated eigenvector whose stabilizer rank scales
linearly with the number of qubits. We prove that further structure in these
Hamiltonians allow us to derive where degeneracies in the eigenspectrum can
arise. We thus open the field to a new class of efficiently simulatable states.

Conclusion: 这些结果深化了对量子复杂性理论中结构边界的理解，揭示了约束类型在量子证明系统中的关键作用。

Abstract: We investigate structural properties of quantum proof systems by establishing
collapse results that uncover simplifications in their complexity landscape. We
extend classical results such as the Karp-Lipton theorem to quantum polynomial
hierarchy with quantum proofs and establish uniqueness preservation for
quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proof systems.
  Our main contributions are threefold. First, we prove that restricting
quantum-classical PCP systems to uniqueness does not reduce computational
power: $\mathsf{UniqueQCPCP} = \mathsf{QCPCP}$ under $\mathsf{BQ}$-operator and
randomized reductions, demonstrating robustness similar to the
$\mathsf{UniqueQCMA} = \mathsf{QCMA}$ result. Second, we establish a
non-uniform quantum analogue of the Karp-Lipton theorem, showing that if
$\mathsf{QMA} \subseteq \mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{qpoly}$, then $\mathsf{QPH}
\subseteq \mathsf{Q\Sigma}_2/\mathsf{qpoly}$, extending the classical collapse
theorem to quantum complexity with quantum advice. Third, we introduce a
consistent variant of the quantum polynomial hierarchy ($\mathsf{CQPH}$) with
consistency constraints across interaction rounds while maintaining
product-state proofs, proving its unconditional collapse $\mathsf{CQPH} =
\mathsf{CQ\Sigma}_2$. This contrasts with prior work on quantum-entangled
polynomial hierarchy, showing that consistency rather than entanglement drives
the collapse.
  These results contribute to understanding structural boundaries in quantum
complexity theory and the interplay between constraint types in quantum proof
systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为非破坏性、直接的缺陷密度量化提供了有力工具，有助于优化hBN在量子光学中的应用。

Abstract: Negatively charged boron vacancies ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) are emerging as promising solid-state spin qubits due to their
optical accessibility, structural simplicity, and compatibility with photonic
platforms. However, quantifying the density of such defects in thin hBN flakes
has remained elusive, limiting progress in device integration and
reproducibility. Here, we present an all-optical method to quantify
$\mathrm{V_B^-}$ defect density in hBN by correlating Raman and
photoluminescence (PL) signatures with irradiation fluence. We identify two
defect-induced Raman modes, D1 and D2, and assign them to vibrational modes of
$\mathrm{V_B^-}$ using polarization-resolved Raman measurements and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. By adapting a numerical model originally
developed for graphene, we establish an empirical relationship linking Raman
(D1, $E_\mathrm{2g}$) and PL intensities to absolute defect densities. This
method is universally applicable across various irradiation types and uniquely
suited for thin flakes, where conventional techniques fail. Our approach
enables accurate, direct, and non-destructive quantification of spin defect
densities down to $10^{15}$ defects/ cm${}^3$, offering a powerful tool for
optimizing and benchmarking hBN for quantum optical applications.

Abstract: Efficient verification of multipartite quantum states is crucial to many
applications in quantum information processing. By virtue of Schmidt
decomposition and mutually unbiased bases, here we propose a universal protocol
to verify arbitrary multipartite pure quantum states using adaptive local
projective measurements. Moreover, we establish a universal upper bound on the
sample complexity that is independent of the local dimensions. Numerical
calculations further indicate that Haar-random pure states can be verified with
a constant sample cost, irrespective of the qudit number and local dimensions,
even in the adversarial scenario in which the source cannot be trusted. As
alternatives, we provide multiple simpler variants that can achieve similar
high efficiencies.

Abstract: High-efficiency single-photon detection in the microwave domain is a key
enabling technology for quantum sensing, communication, and information
processing. However, the extremely low energy of microwave photons (~{\mu}eV)
presents a fundamental challenge, preventing direct photon-to-charge conversion
as achieved in optical systems using semiconductors. Semiconductor quantum dot
(QD) charge qubits offer a compelling solution due to their highly tunable
energy levels in the microwave regime, enabling coherent coupling with single
photons. In this work, we demonstrate microwave photon detection with an
efficiency approaching 70% in the single-photon regime. We use a hybrid system
comprising a double quantum dot (DQD) charge qubit electrostatically defined in
a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, coupled to a high-impedance Josephson junction
(JJ) array cavity. We systematically optimize the hybrid device architecture to
maximize the conversion efficiency, leveraging the strong charge-photon
coupling and the tunable DQD tunnel coupling rates. Incoming cavity photons
coherently excite the DQD qubit, which in turn generates a measurable
electrical current, realizing deterministic photon-to-charge conversion.
Moreover, by exploiting the independent tunability of both the DQD transition
energy and the cavity resonance frequency, we characterize the system
efficiency over a range of 3-5.2 GHz. Our results establish semiconductor-based
cavity-QED architectures as a scalable and versatile platform for efficient
microwave photon detection, opening new avenues for quantum microwave optics
and hybrid quantum information technologies.

Abstract: We unravel the existence and nonequilibrium response of one-dimensional
harmonically trapped droplet configurations in the presence of a central
repulsive or attractive potential well mimicking the effect of a heavy
impurity. For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets
fragment into two for increasing repulsive potential heights, a process that
occurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at
the attractive potential, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed
droplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization
analysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and
the behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height
are used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for repulsive
potentials as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and
eventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of attractive
potential wells. The many-body character of the dynamics is explicated by
evaluating the participating single-particle eigenstates manifesting the
superposition nature of the droplet state. Our results should be detectable by
current ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics
with the aid of external potentials.

Abstract: Biological organisms thrive by adapting to their environments, which are
often unpredictably changeable. We apply recent results from nonequilibrium

Environmental changes that are too fast or too small are not worth tracking.
(2) Well-timed anticipatory tracking enhances fitness in coherent environments.
(3) We compute and explain the optimal adaptive strategy for a system in a
given environment, such as bet hedging or phenotypic memory. Conversely, (4) We
compute and explain the optimal way for an environment to control a given
system, for example for designing drug regimens to limit the growth of
pathogens. By connecting fitness, adaptive strategy, and environmental
variability, this work provides the foundations for a generic physical theory

Abstract: Variational tensor network optimization has become a powerful tool for
studying classical statistical models in two dimensions. However, its
application to three-dimensional systems remains limited, primarily due to the
high computational cost associated with evaluating the free energy density and
its gradient. This process requires contracting a triple-layer tensor network
composed of a projected entangled pair operator and projected entangled pair
states. In this paper, we employ a split corner-transfer renormalization group
scheme tailored for the contraction of such triple-layer networks, which
reduces the computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(D^{12})$ in conventional
methods to $\mathcal{O}(D^{9})$. Through numerical benchmarks on the
three-dimensional classical Ising model, we demonstrate that the proposed
scheme achieves numerical results comparable to the most recent Monte Carlo
simulations, while also providing a substantial speedup over previous
variational tensor network approaches. This makes this method well-suited for
efficient gradient-based optimization in three-dimensional tensor network
simulations.

Conclusion: 研究证实了短程耦合的Q2D XY模型中存在长程有序，为低维超流体序的研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The phase of spins in the quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) XY model has emerged as
a topic of significant interest across multiple physics subfields. Here, we
propose a short-range (SR) Q2D XY model defined on a plane perpendicularly
intersected by a group of parallel planes, with each plane consisting of
nearest-neighbor-coupled XY spins. We perform large-scale Monte Carlo
simulations to establish the full phase diagram of the Q2D XY model, aided by
finite-size scaling. A long-range (LR) ordered phase emerges in the Q2D model
when the spins on the parallel planes develop a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
critical phase. In the LR ordered phase, ordering is anisotropic: LR
correlations develop along the direction of the intersection lines, while
critical correlations emerge perpendicular to them. Furthermore, the LR ordered
phase exhibits Goldstone-mode physics. Our study hence reveals the existence of
LR order in a Q2D XY model with finite SR couplings and opens up a new avenue
to explore superfluid orders in low dimensions.

Abstract: The recurrence time is the time a process first returns to its initial state.
Using quantum walks on a graph, the recurrence time is defined through
stroboscopic monitoring of the arrival of the particle to a node of the system.
When the time interval between repeated measurements is tuned in such a way
that eigenvalues of the unitary become degenerate, the mean recurrence time
exhibits resonances. These resonances imply faster mean recurrence times, which
were recorded on quantum computers. The resonance broadening is captured by a
restart uncertainty relation [R. Yin, Q. Wang, S. Tornow, E. Barkai, Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 122, e2402912121 (2025)]. To ensure a comprehensive
analysis, we extend our investigation to include the impact of system size on
the widened resonances, showing how the connectivity and energy spectrum
structure of a system influence the restart uncertainty relation. Breaking the
symmetry of the system, for example time-reversal symmetry breaking with a
magnetic flux applied to a ring, removes the degeneracy of {the eigenvalues of
the unitary}, hence modifying {the mean recurrence time and the widening of the
transitions}, and this effect is studied in detail. The width of resonances
studied here is related to the finite time resolution of relevant experiments
on quantum computers, and to the restart paradigm.19

Abstract: The superfluid stiffness fundamentally constrains the transition temperature
of superconductors, especially in the strongly coupled regime. However,
accurately determining this inherently quantum many-body property in
microscopic models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we show how
the \textit{quantum many-body bootstrap} framework, specifically the reduced
density matrix (RDM) bootstrap, can be leveraged to obtain rigorous lower
bounds on the superfluid stiffness in frustration free models with
superconducting ground state. We numerically apply the method to a special
class of frustration free models, which are known as quantum geometric nesting
models, for flat-band superconductivity, where we uncover a general relation
between the stiffness and the pair mass. Going beyond the familiar Hubbard case
within this class, we find how additional interactions, notably simple
intra-unit-cell magnetic couplings, can enhance the superfluid stiffness.
Furthermore, the RDM bootstrap unexpectedly reveals that the trion-type
correlations are essential for bounding the stiffness, offering new insights on
the structure of these models. Straight-forward generalization of the method
can lead to bounds on susceptibilities complementary to variational approaches.
Our findings underscore the immense potential of the quantum many-body
bootstrap as a powerful tool to derive rigorous bounds on physical quantities
beyond energy.

hypothetical insulating $d^8$ parent state. We demonstrate that due to the
interplay of superexchange and Hund's coupling, the system can be in a
high-spin, low-spin or spin-gapped state. The low-spin state has singlets
across the bilayer in the $d_{z^2}$ orbital, with charge carriers in the
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Thus, at low energy scales, it behaves as an effective
one band system when hole doped. By contrast, the high-spin state is a more
robust, spin-1 antiferromagnet. Using Hartree-Fock methods, we find that for
fixed interaction strength and doping, high-spin magnetism remains more robust
than the low-spin counterpart. Whether this implies that the high spin state
provides a stronger pairing glue, or more strongly competes with
superconductivity remains an open question. Our analysis therefore underscores
the importance of identifying the spin state for understanding
superconductivity in nickelates.

Conclusion: 研究将手性声子概念扩展到多极磁体，为材料如Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$和PrV$_2$Al$_{20}$的拉曼光谱探测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of anomalously large magnetic response of
chiral phonons in dipolar magnets, we explore an extension to study Einstein
quantum phonon modes coupled to multipolar moments. We consider the case of
non-Kramers $\Gamma_3$ doublets which encapsulate quadrupolar and Ising
octupolar degrees of freedom, and which feature a symmetry-allowed linear
coupling between local quadrupolar moments and Raman active $E_g$ phonon modes
$(d_{x^2-y^2},d_{3z^2-r^2})$. We show that either octupolar or quadrupolar
ordering leads to degeneracy breaking of the $E_g$ phonon doublet, with
ferro-octupolar order favoring pseudo-chiral phonon eigenmodes with a
detectable energy splitting. We describe this physics using a path integral
approach in the limit where `fast' phonon modes sense the `slow' pseudospins as
a static background which we average over using Monte Carlo simulations. We
discuss implications for materials such as Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ and PrV$_2$Al$_{20}$
where Raman spectroscopy of phonons could be used as a potential probe of
hidden octupolar order. Our work extends the important concept of chiral
phonons to a large class of multipolar magnets.

Motivation: 探索隐藏玻色-爱因斯坦奇点对热力学性质的影响，特别是在赝能隙相中的表现。

Method: 从Luttinger-Ward泛函出发，推导了热力学势的表达式，并应用于三维弱吸引哈伯德模型进行数值计算。

Result: 赝能隙相的进入可通过热力学势的奇点检测，尤其是热容的不连续性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了赝能隙相的热力学特征，为理解其物理性质提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study thermodynamic consequences of the hidden Bose-Einstein
singularities, which have been predicted to cause a pseudogap phase, based on
quantum field theory of ordered phases. Starting from the Luttinger-Ward
functional for the grand thermodynamic potential, we derive expressions of the
Helmholtz free energy, internal energy, entropy, and heat capacity in a form
suitable for numerical studies. They are applied to the weakly attractive
Hubbard model in three dimensions to calculate the thermodynamic potentials
numerically and continuously for the normal, pseudogap, and superconducting
phases on the same footing. It is shown that the entry into the pseudogap phase
is detectable as singularities of thermodynamic potentials, especially a
discontinuity in the heat capacity.

Motivation: 将现代拓扑方法系统应用于化学反应，特别是强多参考关联下的反应，以扩展对称性允许和禁止反应的理论框架。

Method: 使用$4\pi$电环化反应为例，通过Green函数分析对称性允许和禁止反应，并引入拓扑不变量。

Result: 发现对称性禁止反应表现为Green函数零点的交叉而非极点的交叉，且对称性破坏会影响反应路径。

Conclusion: 该研究为拓扑方法在化学反应中的应用奠定了基础，并可推广至不同自旋态或激发态的反应。

Abstract: We integrate concepts from topological band theory and strong-correlation
physics with the principle of orbital symmetry conservation, which
characterizes reactions as symmetry allowed or forbidden based on whether
molecular orbitals cross along the reaction coordinate. Using a $4\pi$
electrocyclization as an example, we show how Green's functions generalize the
concepts of symmetry allowed and symmetry forbidden reactions even in the
presence of strong multi-reference correlations. We demonstrate how symmetry
forbidden reactions are characterized by strong multi-reference correlations,
resulting in crossings of Green's function zeros rather than poles as MO-theory
would predict. Taking into account Green's functions zeros, a topological
invariant is introduced that captures symmetry protected crossings of poles or
zeros. We discuss the effects of symmetry breaking and outline generalizations
of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the
reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of
modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be generalized to
reactions involving different spin states or to excited states.

Motivation: 明确硼掺杂如何导致Sn/Si(111)表面从绝缘体转变为金属或超导体的结构、光谱和理论细节。

Result: 实验与理论表明，金属化源于次表层硼掺杂，而非标准次表层硼几何结构。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解这一复杂系统的金属化和超导性提供了重要框架。

Abstract: The Sn/Si(111)-({\sqrt}3{\times}{\sqrt}3)R30{\deg} surface, a 2D Mott
insulator, has long been predicted and then found experimetally to metallize
and even turn superconducting upon boron doping. In order to clarify the
structural, spectroscopic and theoretical details of that evolution, here we
present ARPES data supplementing morphology and scanning tunneling
measurements. These combined experimental results are compared with predictions
from a variety of electronic structure approaches, mostly density functional
DFT+U, but not neglecting Mott-Hubbard models, both ordered and disordered.
These theoretical pictures address different spectroscopic aspects, including
the 2D Fermi surface, the Hubbard bands, etc. While no single picture account
for all observations at once,the emergent hypothesis compatible with all data
is that metallization arises from sub-subsurface boron doping, additional to
the main standard subsurface boron geometry, that would leave the surface
insulating. These results advance the indispensable frame for the further
understanding of this fascinating system.

Motivation: 探索BSCO中自旋玻璃态行为的起源及其与结构无序和几何阻挫的关系。

Method: 通过直流和交流磁化测量、热容测量、中子粉末衍射、X射线衍射和电阻率测量等方法进行研究。

Result: 发现BSCO表现出频率依赖的自旋冻结行为，符合Vogel-Fulcher模型，且无长程磁序。阳离子无序和氧空位是自旋玻璃态行为的关键因素。

Conclusion: BSCO是一种典型的团簇自旋玻璃候选材料，其行为由Co二聚体、无序和几何阻挫共同驱动，为钴基六方钙钛矿中非常规磁态的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We investigate the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of
\BSCO\ ($x$ = 0.04, $\delta$ = 0.54), a hexagonal perovskite featuring
face-sharing CoO$_6$ octahedra that forms Co dimers. DC and AC magnetization
measurements reveal a frequency-dependent spin-freezing transition consistent
with glassy dynamics. AC susceptibility fits best to the Vogel-Fulcher model,
indicating collective freezing of interacting spin clusters. Isothermal
magnetization follows the Langevin function, suggesting finite-sized magnetic
clusters rather than isolated paramagnetic moments. Non-equilibrium dynamics,
evidenced by thermoremanent magnetization and memory effects, further support a
spin-glass-like state. Heat capacity shows no sharp anomalies, and neutron
powder diffraction confirms the absence of magnetic Bragg peaks down to 1.5~K,
ruling out long-range magnetic order. Rietveld refinement reveals significant
Co/Sb intersite disorder ($\sim$~30\pct) and oxygen non-stoichiometry,
introducing exchange randomness and frustration that drive the spin-glass-like
behavior. Electrical resistivity exhibits Arrhenius-type temperature dependence
with an activation energy of 0.173~eV, consistent with semiconducting behavior.
Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction shows no structural phase transitions,
confirming that the spin-glass-like state is not lattice-driven. Our results
establish \BSCO\ as a cluster spin-glass candidate, where Co dimers, disorder,
and geometric frustration prevent long-range order, leading to slow spin
dynamics. These findings highlight the role of cation disorder and oxygen
vacancies in stabilizing unconventional magnetic states in cobalt-based
hexagonal perovskites.

Abstract: We report the successful growth of high-quality single crystals of \ACVO, a
quasi-one-dimensional zigzag chain compound containing Co$^{2+}$ ions, using
the optical floating zone method. The crystal growth was stabilized under
high-pressure argon-oxygen gas with slow growth rates, overcoming challenges
associated with the incongruent melting behavior of this material. X-ray
diffraction confirms the zigzag arrangement of Co$^{2+}$ ions, forming a
quasi-one-dimensional chain structure. Magnetic susceptibility and heat
capacity measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic phase transition at the
N\'eel temperature ($T_{\text{N}} \sim 3.5$ K) and negative Curie-Weiss
temperatures, indicative of dominant antiferromagnetic interactions. The
distorted CoO$_6$ octahedral geometry and strong spin-orbit coupling suggest
that Co$^{2+}$ ions likely exhibit an effective $J = 1/2 $ Kramers doublet
state. The results presented here demonstrate the potential of \ACVO\ as a
platform for investigating low-dimensional magnetism and quantum magnetic
phenomena. These insights shed light on the role of the ${A}$-site ion in
tuning the magnetic interactions, which will foster future research into the
field-induced behavior in these cobalt vanadates.

Abstract: We introduce twisted anisotropic homobilayers as a distinct class of moir\'e
systems, characterized by a distinctive ``magic angle", $\theta_M$, where both
the moir\'e unit cell and Brillouin zone collapse. Unlike conventional studies
of moir\'e materials, which primarily focus on small lattice misalignments, we
demonstrate that this moir\'e collapse occurs at large twist angles in generic
twisted anisotropic homobilayers. The collapse angle, $\theta_M$, is likely to
give rise quasi-crystal behavior as well as to the formation of strongly
correlated states, that arise not from flat bands, but from the presence of
ultra-anisotropic electronic states, where non-Fermi liquid phases can be
stabilized. In this work, we develop a continuum model for electrons based on
extensive \textit{ab initio} calculations for twisted bilayer black phosphorus,
enabling a detailed study of the emerging moir\'e collapse features in this
archetypal system. We show that the (temperature) stability criterion for the
emergence of (sliding) Luttinger liquids is generally met as the twist angle
approaches $\theta_M$. Furthermore, we explicitly formulate the collapsed
single-particle one-dimensional (1D) continuum Hamiltonian and provide the
\textit{fully interacting}, bosonized Hamiltonian applicable at low doping
levels. Our analysis reveals a rich landscape of multichannel Luttinger
liquids, potentially enhanced by valley degrees of freedom at large twist
angles.
