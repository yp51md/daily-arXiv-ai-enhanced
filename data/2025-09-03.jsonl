This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial\nlearning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how\nthe decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as\n$1/\\tau$ or slower, where $\\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the\nlocalized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they\nare linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\\tau$, for instance\nexponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where\nwell localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed\nwith intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes,\nfor a kernel in $1/\\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the\nfastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect.

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum\nLinear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based\nLinear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally\nconnected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and\narrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with\na QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the\nscaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with\nthe graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size\ngrowth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential\nadvantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at\nleast polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm\nconsidered relative to the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Within the scope of\nour analyses, we observe that only 4 percent of the 50 considered graph\nfamilies offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20 percent\nof the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we\nobserve and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only\nfare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm\nbut also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial\nadvantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given\nthe limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical\nstudies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families\ninto one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs\nin it. Lastly, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that one may\nface even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied,\nincluding quantum hardware challenges."}

This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also\nquantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that\ngravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different\nto the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry.\nExperiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is\nquantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of\ngravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A\npathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal\nfirst using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be\nnanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can\nsubsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement.\nThis is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental\nprogress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a\nmedium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including\nvibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress\nand plans towards realizing this.

We investigate the\nelectronic friction behavior for the Hubbard-Holstein model using density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) theory. We show that electron-electron\ninteractions lead to the formation of two energy levels in the impurity,\nresulting in two peaks in the electronic friction at the resonances of electron\nattachment or detachment with the metal's Fermi level. We further benchmark our\nresults against mean field theory (MFT) and exact diagonalization (ED). The\nresults calculated by ED and DMRG show strong agreement at high temperatures,\nsuggesting the results from DMRG are reliable; however, at low temperatures, ED\nexhibits significant deviations relative to DMRG due to the finite-size\nlimitations inherent in ED calculations. MFT completely fails to recover Fermi\nresonance in electronic friction. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the\nelectronic friction using EF-LD.

The spectroscopic signature of such interaction\nis often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end,\ninter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir\\'e\nsuperlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence\nof both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show\nthat the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive\nto attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir\\'e-pocket to\nintra-moir\\'e-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex\ncompetition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure\nfrom the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer\npolarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous\nsuperlinear power-law of moir\\'e exciton and a stabilization of moir\\'e trapped\nbiexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the\nhetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly\nreduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller\nensemble of moir\\'e pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an\ninteresting platform to explore interaction among moir\\'e trapped excitons and\nhigher order quasiparticles."}

First, we develop a\nheuristic picture for generic Floquet systems that connects Loschmidt echoes,\nout-of-time-order correlators, and operator growth, which is valid at any\ndissipation strength.

We denote these\nfidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity\n(FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with\nthe standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in\nseveral instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times\nand large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a\nquasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the\nhydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite\nsequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary\nlarge group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like\nsingularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic\nregime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to\nthe so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a\ncriterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at\nwhich the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of\nthe FSF.
