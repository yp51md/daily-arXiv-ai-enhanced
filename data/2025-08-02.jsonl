Consequently, quantum circuits are\ntheoretically capable of supporting large scale parallel computation. However,\napplying them to financial analysis particularly in the areas of random number\ngeneration and payoff computation remains a significant challenge. Experts\ngenerally believe that quantum computing relies on matrix operations, which are\ndeterministic in nature without randomness. This inherent determinism makes it\nparticularly challenging to design quantum circuits that require random number\ninjection. JP Morgan[1] introduced the piecewise linear (PWL) approach for\nmodeling payoff computations but did not disclose a quantum circuit capable of\nidentifying values exceeding the strike price, suggesting a possible reliance\non classical pre processing for interval classification. This paper presents an\nintegrated quantum circuit with two key components: one for random number\ninjection, applicable to risk assessment, and the other for direct payoff\ncomputation, relevant to financial pricing. These components are compatible\nwith a scalable framework that leverages large scale parallelism and Quantum\nAmplitude Estimation (QAE) to achieve quadratic speedup. The circuit was\nimplemented on IBM Qiskit and evaluated using 8 parallel threads and 1600\nmeasurement shots.

Zero-Noise\nExtrapolation (ZNE), which we mainly consider in this work, is one of prominent\nquantum error mitigation methods. For algorithms with deep circuits - such as\niterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's\neffectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise. Extrapolation based\non such low-fidelity data often yields inaccurate estimates and requires\nsubstantial overhead. In this study, we propose a lightweight,\nextrapolation-based error mitigation framework tailored for structured quantum\nalgorithms composed of repeating operational blocks. The proposed method\ncharacterizes the error of the repeated core operational block, rather than the\nfull algorithm, using shallow circuits. Extrapolation is used to estimate the\nblock fidelity, followed by a reconstruction of the mitigated success\nprobability. We validate our method via simulations of the 6-qubit Grover's\nalgorithm on IBM's Aer simulator, then further evaluating it on the real\n127-qubit IBM Quantum system based on Eagle r3 under a physical noise\nenvironment.
