We establish that thermalization in such systems does not require global ergodicity; instead, it arises from effective local ergodicity, where dynamics in a subsystem may appear pseudorandom. To corroborate that, we analyze the spectrum of the unitary evolution operator and propose an ansatz to describe statistical properties of local observables expanded in the eigenfunction basis - the classical counterpart of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. Our framework provides a unified perspective on thermalization in classical and quantum systems with discrete spectra."}

Then, we applied the method to the Sierpiński gasket with 11 and 15 spins.

The fractional derivative is introduced so as to reproduce the low-wavenumber density of states of the standard two-dimensional model, allowing phase coexistence to occur in a minimal one-dimensional setting under steady heat conduction. By imposing a constant heat flux through boundary heat baths, we observe stable coexistence of ordered and disordered phases separated by a stationary interface. We find that the temperature at the interface systematically deviates from the equilibrium transition temperature, demonstrating a clear violation of the local equilibrium description. This deviation indicates that equilibrium metastable states can be stabilized and controlled by a steady heat current. Furthermore, the interface temperature obtained in our simulations is in quantitative agreement with the prediction of global thermodynamics for non-equilibrium steady states. These results confirm that the breakdown of local equilibrium and the stabilization of metastable states are intrinsic features of non-equilibrium first-order phase transitions, independent of spatial dimensionality. Our study thus provides a minimal and controlled numerical model for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamic descriptions in non-equilibrium steady states."}

Current experiments with ultracold polar molecules employ shielding with microwave or static electric fields to prevent destructive collisional losses. The interaction potential of microwave-shielded molecules can be tuned by using microwaves of two different polarisations, while for static-field-shielded molecules the tunability of interactions is more limited and depends on the particular species. In this work, we propose a general method to tune the interactions between static-field-shielded molecules by applying a microwave field. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations in a field-dressed basis set to determine loss rate coefficients and scattering lengths. We find that both the s-wave scattering length and the dipole length can be widely tuned by changing the parameters of the microwave field, while maintaining strong suppression of lossy collisions."}

We show that the topology and anomaly associated with average symmetry can be used to predict certain nontrivial universal properties. Our focus is on systems subject to average Lieb--Schultz--Mattis constraints, where lattice translation symmetry is preserved only on average, while on-site symmetries remain exact. We argue that in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the system must exhibit critical correlations of local operators in two distinct ways: (i) for some operator $O_e$ charged under exact symmetries, the first absolute moment correlation $\\overline{|\\langle O_e(x)O^{\\dagger}_e(y)\\rangle|}$ decays slowly; and (ii) for some operator $O_a$ charged under average symmetries, the first-moment correlation $\\overline{\\langle O_a(x)O^{\\dagger}_a(y)\\rangle}$ decays slowly. We verify these predictions in a few examples: the random-singlet Heisenberg spin chain in one dimension, and the disordered free-fermion critical states in symmetry class BDI in one and two dimensions. Surprisingly, even for these well-studied systems, our anomaly-based argument reveals critical correlations overlooked in previous literature. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of measuring these critical correlations."}

Working in the biorthogonal formalism, we identify the conformal structure of this theory by constructing a traceless energy-momentum tensor whose Fourier modes generate a Virasoro algebra with central charge $c=-2$. This yields a non-Hermitian, biorthogonal realization of a logarithmic conformal field theory, in which correlation functions exhibit logarithmic scaling and the spectrum forms Virasoro staggered modules that are characterized by universal indecomposability parameters.

The present work undertakes to investigate the issue of reality, treading a more fundamental route from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics to the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics. Motivation for this is a similar approach from the eikonal equation in geometrical optics to the wave equation in electromagnetic theory. We rewrite the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation as a wave equation and seek to generalise de Broglie's wave particle duality by demanding that both particle and light waves have the freedom of being described by any square-integrable function. This generalisation, which allows superposition also for matter wave functions, helps us to obtain the Schrodinger equation, whose solution can be seen to be as much objective as the classical mechanics wave function. Several other equations which one writes in quantum mechanics, including the eigenvalue equations for observables, series expansion of energy states in terms of eigenstates of observables other than energy, etc., can be written in the classical case too. Absence of any collapse of the wave function, entanglement, etc. in the classical realm have their origin in the nonlinearity of the classical wave equation. These considerations indicate that many of the puzzles in quantum mechanics are present also in classical mechanics in a dormant form, which fact shall help to demystify quantum mechanics to a great extent."}

Unlike an impenetrable object, a penetrable obstacle does not fully deplete the density. We define an effective diameter D_eff from the Mach-1 contour of the time-averaged irrotational flow around the obstacle, which delineates the local supersonic region where quantized vortices nucleate. Using this flow-defined length scale, we construct a superfluid Reynolds number Re_s = (v0 minus vc) times D_eff divided by (hbar over m), where v0 is the flow speed, vc is the critical velocity, and m is the particle mass. We show that Re_s organizes the wake dynamics across obstacle sizes and strengths: the transition from dipole-row emission to alternating vortex cluster shedding occurs at Re_s around 2, and both the Strouhal number and the drag coefficient collapse onto universal curves when plotted as functions of Re_s. These results extend the concept of dynamic similarity in superfluid flows to penetrable obstacles and demonstrate that the dynamically relevant length scale is determined by the supersonic region rather than by the geometric obstacle size."}

We propose a physically transparent framework in which NQS are treated as neural approximations to latent imaginary-time evolution. This viewpoint suggests that standard Transformer-based NQS (TQS) architectures correspond to physically unmotivated effective Hamiltonians dependent on imaginary time in a latent space. Building on this interpretation, we introduce physics-inspired transformer quantum states (PITQS), which enforce a static effective Hamiltonian by sharing weights across layers and improve propagation accuracy via Trotter-Suzuki decompositions without increasing the number of variational parameters. For the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, our ansätze achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art TQS while using substantially fewer variational parameters. This study demonstrates that reinterpreting the deep network structure as a latent cooling process enables a more physically grounded, systematic, and compact design, thereby bridging the gap between black-box expressivity and physically transparent construction."}

This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations.

This effect arises from the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries in the exciton condensate, resulting in direction-dependent critical counterflow currents. The resulting nonreciprocal perfect Coulomb drag provides a clear and unambiguous transport signature of phase-coherent exciton condensation, offering a powerful and experimentally accessible approach to identify, probe, and control exciton superfluidity in solid-state platforms."}

This protocol enables a transparent separation of the roles of the delay time $τ$, the waiting time $t_{\\text{w}}$, and the normalized warm temperature $ω$, thus providing a flexible setting to characterize anomalous thermal relaxation. For instantaneous quenches, exact conditions for the existence of the Mpemba effect are obtained as bounds on $ω$ for given $τ$ and $t_{\\text{w}}$. Within those bounds, the effect becomes maximal at a specific value $ω=\\widetildeω(t_{\\text{w}})$, and its magnitude is quantified by the extremal value of the temperature-difference function at this optimum. Accurate and compact approximations for both $\\widetildeω(t_{\\text{w}})$ and the maximal magnitude $\\text{Mp}(t_{\\text{w}})$ are derived, showing in particular that the absolute maximum at fixed $τ$ is reached for $t_{\\text{w}}=τ$. A comparison with a previously studied two-reservoir protocol reveals that, despite its additional control parameter, the Descartes protocol yields a smaller maximal magnitude of the effect. The analysis is extended to finite-rate quenches, where strict equality of bath conditions prevents a genuine Mpemba effect, although an approximate one survives when the bath time scale is sufficiently short. The developed framework offers a unified and analytically tractable approach that can be readily applied to other multi-step thermal protocols."}

While the BCS, Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO), and normal phases occupy different regions on the phase diagram when the parameters are uniform, a spatial change of pairing strength or spin polarization can drive the system from the FFLO phase to a normal gas or from a BCS superfluid to the FFLO phase in real space. The FFLO phase exhibits its signature modulating order parameter at the FFLO momentum due to population imbalance, and the pair correlation penetrates the polarized normal phase and exhibits proximity effects. Meanwhile, the BCS phase tends to repel population imbalance and maintain a plateau of pairing. Interestingly, a buffer FFLO phase emerges when the spatial change attempts to join the BCS and normal phase in the presence of spin polarization. By analyzing the pairing correlations, interfacial properties, and momentum-space spectra of the inhomogeneous structures, relevant length- and momentum- scales and their interplay are characterized. We also briefly discuss implications of inhomogeneous multi-phase atomic Fermi gases with population imbalance."}

We introduce the Spatial Attention mechanism, a minimal and physically interpretable inductive bias for Neural-Network Quantum States, implemented as a single learned length scale within the Transformer architecture. This bias stabilizes large-scale optimization and enables access to thermodynamic-limit physics through highly accurate simulations on unprecedented system sizes within the Variational Monte Carlo framework. Applied to the spin-$\\tfrac12$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on clusters of up to $42\\times42$ sites. The ability to simulate such large systems allows controlled finite-size scaling of energies and order parameters, enabling the extraction of experimentally relevant quantities such as spin-wave velocities and uniform susceptibilities. In turn, we find extrapolated thermodynamic limit energies systematically better than those obtained with tensor-network approaches such as iPEPS. The resulting magnetization is strongly renormalized, $M_0=0.148(1)$ (about $30\\%$ of the classical value), revealing that less accurate variational states systematically overestimate magnetic order. Analysis of the optimized wave function further suggests an intrinsically non-local sign structure, indicating that the sign problem cannot be removed by local basis transformations. We finally demonstrate the generality of the method by obtaining state-of-the-art energies for a $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a $20\\times20$ square lattice, outperforming Residual Convolutional Neural Networks."}

Here, we demonstrate the reconstructive polarimetry with infrared (IR) detectors based on simple gated graphene-metal junctions. The reconstruction exploits the gate tuning of polarization contrast, which enables the evaluation of both infrared power and polarization angle from photovoltage measurements at two sequential gate voltages. The physics enabling the polarimetry lies in polarization-dependent shift of the electron hot spot near the contact, and the gate tuning of the of light-sensitive barrier width.

While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases."}

We show that the topology and anomaly associated with average symmetry can be used to predict certain nontrivial universal properties. Our focus is on systems subject to average Lieb--Schultz--Mattis constraints, where lattice translation symmetry is preserved only on average, while on-site symmetries remain exact. We argue that in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the system must exhibit critical correlations of local operators in two distinct ways: (i) for some operator $O_e$ charged under exact symmetries, the first absolute moment correlation $\\overline{|\\langle O_e(x)O^{\\dagger}_e(y)\\rangle|}$ decays slowly; and (ii) for some operator $O_a$ charged under average symmetries, the first-moment correlation $\\overline{\\langle O_a(x)O^{\\dagger}_a(y)\\rangle}$ decays slowly. We verify these predictions in a few examples: the random-singlet Heisenberg spin chain in one dimension, and the disordered free-fermion critical states in symmetry class BDI in one and two dimensions. Surprisingly, even for these well-studied systems, our anomaly-based argument reveals critical correlations overlooked in previous literature. We also discuss the experimental feasibility of measuring these critical correlations."}

In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable. Using the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), we prepare thermal equilibrium states in the false vacuum and extract decay rates from the magnetization dynamics. The decay rates show an exponential dependence on temperature, in line with the thermal theory of instantons. Since the SGPE is based on complex scalar fields, it also allows us to explore the behavior of the phase, which turns out to become dynamic during decay. Our results confirm the SGPE as an effective tool for studying coupled magnetization and phase dynamics and the associated instanton physics in ultracold quantum gases."}

These processes determine the magnon lifetime, which can be used to estimate thermal conductivity in a single-mode approximation.

This signifies that heat is carried not by individual magnons but by their linear combinations -- relaxons.

We ask whether a compiler can instead accept simple, structure-aware specifications while providing predictable resource guarantees. We answer this by designing and implementing a quantum state-preparation compiler for regular language states (RLS): uniform superpositions over bitstrings accepted by a regular description, and their complements. Users describe the target state via (i) a finite set of bitstrings, (ii) a regular expression, or (iii) a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), optionally with a complement flag. By translating the input to a DFA, minimizing it, and mapping it to an optimal matrix product state (MPS), the compiler obtains an intermediate representation (IR) that exposes and compresses hidden structure. The efficient DFA representation and minimization offloads expensive linear algebra computation in exchange of simpler automata manipulations. The combination of the regular-language frontend and this IR gives concise specifications not only for RLS but also for their complements that might otherwise require exponentially large state descriptions. This enables state preparation of an RLS or its complement with the same asymptotic resources and compile time. We outline two hardware-aware backends: SeqRLSP, which yields linear-depth, ancilla-free circuits for linear nearest-neighbor architectures via sequential generation, and TreeRLSP, which achieves logarithmic depth on all-to-all connectivity via a tree tensor network. We prove depth and gate-count bounds scaling with the system size and the state's maximal Schmidt rank, and we give explicit compile-time bounds that expose the benefit of our approach.

We show here that this is not always the case. For this purpose, we study the quenched dynamics of a continuously monitored Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, described by the Lindblad formalism, coupled to a thermal environment modeled by another SYK maintained at constant temperature. We find that the combined effect of monitoring and the thermal bath drives the system toward a non-thermal steady state independently of the initial conditions. The corresponding retarded Green's function exhibits two stages of exponential decay, with rates that depend non-monotonously on the thermal bath coupling and the monitoring strength. In the limit of weak coupling, the late time decay of the Green's function, computed analytically, is closely related to that of the thermal bath. Strikingly, we identify a range of parameters in which continuous monitoring, despite being a source of decoherence, induces or enhances quantum chaotic dynamics suppressed by the thermal bath. For instance, in the limit of weak coupling to the thermal bath, the Lyapunov exponent increases sharply when monitoring is turned on. For intermediate values of the thermal bath coupling, the Lyapunov exponent exhibits re-entrant behavior: it vanishes at zero or sufficiently weak monitoring strength, and becomes positive again as the monitoring strength is increased. Our results offer intriguing insights on the mechanisms leading to quantum scrambling which paves the way to its experimental control and consequently to a performance enhancement of quantum information devices."}

In molecular spin systems, chemical tunability and atomic-scale resolution are accompanied by a dense, thermally accessible phonon spectrum that introduces efficient spin relaxation pathways. Despite extensive theoretical work, there is little experimental consensus on which vibrational energies dominate spin relaxation or how molecular structure controls spin-phonon coupling (SPC). We present a fully experimental method to quantify SPC coefficients by combining temperature-dependent vibrational spectra from inelastic neutron scattering with spin relaxation rates measured by electron paramagnetic resonance. We apply this framework to two model S = 1/2 systems, copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) and copper(II) octaethylporphyrin (CuOEP). Two distinct relaxation regimes emerge: below 40 K, weakly coupled lattice modes below $50~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ dominate, whereas above 40 K, optical phonons above ~$185~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ become thermally populated and drive relaxation with SPC coefficients nearly three orders of magnitude larger. Structural distortions in CuOEP that break planar symmetry soften the crystal lattice and enhance anharmonic scattering, but also raise the energy of stretching modes at the molecular core where the spins reside. This redistributes vibrational energy toward the molecular periphery and out of plane, ultimately reducing SPC relative to CuPc and enabling room-temperature spin coherence in CuOEP. Although our method does not provide mode-specific SPC coefficients, it quantifies contributions from distinct spectral regions and establishes a broadly applicable, fully experimental link between crystal structure, lattice dynamics, and spin relaxation."}

Ultraviolet excitation dynamics in these networks are typically modeled with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. By extending this approach to a Lindblad master equation that incorporates explicit site geometries and dipole orientations, we track how correlations are generated, routed, and dissipated, while capturing both energy dissipation and information propagation among coupled chromophores. We compare localized injections, fully delocalized preparations, and eigenmode-based initial states. To quantify the emerging quantum-informational structure, we evaluate the $L_1$ norm of coherence, the correlated coherence, and the logarithmic negativity within and between selected chromophore sub-networks. The results reveal a strong dependence of both the direction and persistence of information flow on the type of initial preparation. Superradiant components drive the rapid export of correlations to the environment, whereas subradiant components retain them and slow their leakage. Embedding single tubulin units into larger dimers and spirals reshapes pairwise correlation maps and enables site-selective routing. Scaling to larger ordered lattices strengthens both export and retention channels, whereas static energetic and structural disorder suppresses long-range transport and reduces overall correlation transfer. These findings provide a Lindbladian picture of information flow in cytoskeletal chromophore networks and identify structural and dynamical conditions that transiently preserve nonclassical correlations in microtubules."}

However, passive reset occurs on timescales that are much longer than those of gate operations and measurements, making it a significant bottleneck for algorithmic execution. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting the Mpemba effect, originally indicating the faster cooling of hot systems compared to cooler ones. Focusing on the regime where coherence times exceed energy relaxation times ($T_2 > T_1$), we propose a simple protocol based on a single entangling two-qubit gate that converts local single-qubit coherences into fast-decaying global two-qubit coherences. This removes their overlap with the slowest decaying Liouvillian mode and enables a substantially faster relaxation to the ground state. For realistic parameters, we find that our protocol can reduce reset times by up to $50\\%$ compared to standard passive reset. We analyze the robustness of the protocol under non-Markovian noise, imperfect coherent control and finite temperature, finding that the accelerated reset persists across a broad range of realistic error sources. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of our protocol on an IQM superconducting quantum processor. Our results demonstrate how Mpemba-like accelerated relaxation can be harnessed as a practical tool for fast and accurate qubit initialization."}

Here, using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic properties of trilayer nickelates. In La4Ni3O10, we observe pronounced interorbital hybridization, whereas in Pr4Ni3O10, the flat d_(z^2 ) band becomes markedly incoherent and diminishes in spectral weight. By contrast, the dispersive d_(x^2-y^2 ) bands retain coherence in both compounds. This striking incoherence/coherence dichotomy identifies an orbital-selective Mott phase modulated by the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bonding angle. The depletion of the d_(z^2 ) orbitals further frustrates the interorbital hybridization and influences the density-wave transition in Pr4Ni3O10. Moreover, the density-wave gap is substantially reduced in Pr4Ni3O10, likely due to extra scattering channels provided by the local moments of Pr3+ cations.

In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable.

By analyzing the structure of the lattice force during nonequilibrium evolution, we show that the force naturally separates into a smooth quasi-adiabatic component and a residual bath-like contribution associated with fast electronic fluctuations. The quasi-adiabatic component depends only on the instantaneous local lattice configuration and can be efficiently learned using machine-learning techniques, while a minimal Langevin description of the bath term captures the essential features of the recovery dynamics. Combining these elements enables efficient and scalable simulations of long-time nonequilibrium dynamics on large lattices, providing a practical route to access driven correlated systems beyond the reach of direct nonadiabatic approaches."}

In this work, we investigate the effect of cavity induced photon fields on a topological superconductor hosting Majorana bound states (MBS). We model the system using a Peierls substitution of the photonic operator in the kinetic and spin-orbit terms, and utilize an exact diagonalization of Hamiltonian for a finite number of photons to investigate the coupled system. We find that the MBS persist even in the presence of a cavity field and notably appear at finite and tunable energy, in contrast to a usual 1D topological superconductor. The MBS energy is shifted by two processes: the cavity photon energy adds a constant energy shift, while the light-matter interaction induces additional parameter dependencies, such that the MBS experience a pseudo-dispersion as a function of both light-matter interaction and magnetic field. Additionally, we find that the MBS energy oscillations are suppressed with increasing light-matter interaction and that disorder stability is not impacted by the light-matter interaction. Combined, these offer additional tunability and stability of the MBS. As a second result, we establish a modified spectral localizer formalism as an essential tool for topological characterization of quantum matter in a cavity. The spectral localizer allows characterization at arbitrary energies, which is needed for probing different photon sectors. However, hybridization between different photon sectors in the low-frequency regime limits a straightforward application of a standard spectral localizer. We fully resolve this issue by judiciously applying an energy shift to the spectral localizer. Our work thus introduces a new avenue for controlling MBS via light-matter coupling and provides a framework for exploring cavity-modified topologies."}

This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the Tesseract decoder through low-level performance enhancements. Based on extensive profiling, we implemented four targeted optimization strategies, including the replacement of inefficient data structures, reorganization of memory layouts to improve cache hit rates, and the use of hardware-accelerated bit-wise operations. We achieved significant decoding speedups across a wide range of code families and configurations, including Color Codes, Bivariate-Bicycle Codes, Surface Codes, and Transversal CNOT Protocols.

Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate.

While the magnetic moment of a ferromagnet aligns with an applied magnetic field, it has been experimentally shown that the magnetic order can be inverted by injecting spin current into the magnet. This results in an energetically unstable but dynamically stabilized state where the magnetic moment aligns antiparallel to an applied magnetic field, called the inverted magnetic state. The excitations on top of such a state have negative energy and are called antimagnons. The inverted state is subject to fluctuations, in particular, as shot noise in the spin current, which are different from fluctuations in equilibrium, especially at low temperatures. Here, we theoretically study the fluctuations of the inverted magnetic state and their signatures in experimental setups. We find that the fluctuations from the injection of spin current play a large role.

Superconducting qubits are commonly realized using Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$/Al Josephson junctions operating in the tunneling regime, where even minor variations in device geometry can lead to substantial performance fluctuations. In this work, we develop a quantitative model for the variability of the Josephson energy $E_{J}$ induced by interface roughness at the Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$ interfaces. The roughness is modeled as a Gaussian random field characterized by two parameters: the root-mean-square roughness amplitude $σ$ and the transverse correlation length $ξ$. These parameters are extracted from the literature and molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum transport is treated using the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation combined with a local thickness approximation. Numerical simulations over $5,000$ Josephson junctions show that $E_{J}$ follows a log-normal distribution. The mean value of $E_{J}$ increases with $σ$ and decreases slightly with $ξ$, while the variance of $E_{J}$ increases with both $σ$ and $ξ$. These results paint a quantitative and intuitive picture of Josephson energy variability induced by surface roughness, with direct relevance for junction design."}

Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different interaction strengths using bath parameters extracted from the DMFT self-consistency loop. For a four-site model, the relative error in the ground state energy remains well below $0.01%$ with a compact parameter set $(N_p \\le 30)$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the single-particle Green's function-the central quantity for DMFT-can be accurately extracted from VQE-prepared ground states via real-time evolution in the intermediate to strong interaction regimes. However, in the weak interaction regime, the Green's function exhibits noticeable deviations from the exact benchmark, particularly in resolving low-energy spectral features, despite the ground state energy showing excellent agreement. These findings demonstrate that VQE combined with real-time evolution can effectively extend quantum-classical hybrid DMFT beyond the two-site approximation, particularly for describing insulating phases. While this approach offers a viable pathway for simulating strongly correlated materials on near-term devices, the observation that accurate ground state energy does not guarantee accurate dynamical properties highlights a key challenge for applying such approaches to correlated metals."}

The latter incurs no energy cost, but rather the reset occurs at the cost of angular momentum from a spin bath that acts as the thermal spin reservoir. The SHE represents an important first step toward demonstrating heat engines that operate beyond the conventional paradigm of requiring two thermal reservoirs, paving the way to harness quantum coherence in arbitrary conserved quantities via similar machines."}

This is a critical review that summarizes the current applications of quantum annealing to combinatorial optimization and includes a theoretical background, hardware designs, algorithm implementation strategies, encoding and embedding schemes, protocols to benchmark quantum annealing, areas of implementation, and links with the quantum algorithms implementation with gate-based hardware and classical solvers.

Our focus is on systems subject to average Lieb--Schultz--Mattis constraints, where lattice translation symmetry is preserved only on average, while on-site symmetries remain exact. We argue that in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the system must exhibit critical correlations of local operators in two distinct ways: (i) for some operator $O_e$ charged under exact symmetries, the first absolute moment correlation $\\overline{|\\langle O_e(x)O^{\\dagger}_e(y)\\rangle|}$ decays slowly; and (ii) for some operator $O_a$ charged under average symmetries, the first-moment correlation $\\overline{\\langle O_a(x)O^{\\dagger}_a(y)\\rangle}$ decays slowly.

Then, using atomistic tight-binding and strain-extended continuum models to study the commensurate structures, we identify configurations that minimize the bandwidth beyond the magic angle. The results reveal a strong dependence of band narrowing and topology on strain type, magnitude, direction and lattice relaxation. Particularly, shear strain produces a stronger distortion than uniaxial strain. Including electron-electron interactions through a self-consistent Hartree potential shows that strain broadens the bare bands while reducing electrostatic renormalization. Strain also drives topological transitions as the narrow and remote bands hybridize, establishing twisted and strained bilayer graphene as a tunable platform for flat-band and topological phenomena."}

While simple and effective, this coupling scheme makes it difficult to satisfy competing circuit design requirements such as maintaining large qubit anharmonicity and coherence along with a high degree of qubit connectivity and packing density. Moreover, tunable interactions using linear coupling elements produce dynamical variations in mode hybridization, which can induce non-adiabatic transitions, resulting in leakage errors and limiting gate speeds. In this work we attempt to address these challenges by proposing a junction-based coupling architecture based on SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) couplers with relatively small Josephson energies. SQUID couplers provide intrinsic cross-Kerr interactions that can be controlled by external fluxes and that do not rely on mode hybridization. The small Josephson energies of the coupler maintain the interaction at a perturbative scale, which limits undesired higher-order mixing between coupled elements while achieving a sufficiently strong cross-Kerr interaction originating from diagonal coupling elements. Based on these properties, we show that a SQUID coupler can be used to implement a fast, adiabatic, and high-fidelity controlled-Z gate without introducing extra modes, and the operation is robust against junction asymmetry for high-frequency qubits. Although unconventional crosstalk may arise due to junction asymmetries and parasitic hybridization with spectator qubits, we show that these effects are sufficiently small for realistic circuit parameters. As an example of the utility of such junction-based coupling schemes, we present a scalable tiling strategy for a miniaturized superconducting quantum processor based on merged-element transmon qubits."}

Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit interleaved with a finite density of Haar-random single-site gates, followed by a depolarizing channel with strength $γ$. For Floquet Clifford circuits built from an \\textit{i}SWAP-class two-qubit gate, our analysis identifies two distinct regimes for the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit, exemplified by the undoped and fully doped extreme cases. In both regimes, the dissipative diagnostic signals chaotic behavior, differing only in how the gap scales with system size. In the undoped circuit, the gap scales as $Δ\\sim γN$, whereas in the fully doped circuit it remains finite as $N\\to\\infty$. We find that the doping density $p_h$ governs the crossover: as $p_h\\to 0$, any spatial structure remains undoped-like, whereas for finite $p_h$ certain structures can enter a finite-gap regime. These results are analytically established in the strongly dissipative regime $γ\\gg 1$ by deriving lower bounds on the gap as a function of $p_h$ and explicit finite-gap constructions, and their extension toward $γ\\to 0$ is supported by numerics. Importantly, our analytic treatment depends only on the spatial doping structure, so the same gap scaling persists even when the Haar rotations are independently resampled each Floquet period."}

A recent paper by Meister et al. [arXiv:2405.07433 (2024)] proposed an efficient method to evaluate soft outputs for cluster-based decoders, including the Union-Find (UF) decoder. However, in parallel computing environments, its computational complexity is comparable to or even surpasses that of the UF decoder itself, resulting in a substantial overhead. Furthermore, this method requires global information about the decoding graph, making it poorly suited for existing hardware implementations of the UF decoder on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In this paper, to alleviate these issues, we develop more efficient methods for evaluating high-quality soft outputs in cluster-based decoders by introducing several early-stopping techniques. Our central idea is that the precise value of a large soft output is often unnecessary in practice. Based on this insight, we introduce two types of novel soft-outputs: the bounded cluster gap and the extra-cluster gap. The former reduces the computational complexity of Meister's method by terminating the calculation at an early stage. Our numerical simulations show that this method achieves improved scaling with code distance $d$ compared to the original proposal. The latter, the extra-cluster gap, quantifies decoder reliability by performing a small, additional growth of the clusters obtained by the decoder. This approach offers the significant advantage of enabling soft-output computation without modifying the existing architecture of FPGA-implemented UF decoders. These techniques offer lower computational complexity and higher hardware compatibility, laying a crucial foundation for future real-time decoders with soft outputs."}

We characterize analytically the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian in terms of a spectral function, and numerically compute the Zak phase to probe the bulk topological content of the insulating phases. Our findings reveal that, while the Zak phase is quantized in classes AIII and BDI, it exhibits non-quantized values in class D, challenging its traditional role as a topological marker in continuum settings. We also discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence for a truncated version of the chain, analyzing how the emergence of edge states depends on both the truncation position and the boundary conditions. In classes AIII and BDI, we find that the Zak phase effectively detects edge states as a relative boundary topological index, although the correspondence is highly sensitive to the parameters characterizing the truncation."}

We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design.

Applying the rotating wave approximation (RWA) to the system-bath interaction Hamiltonian, we derive a completely positive Born-Markov master equation for the reduced dynamics. We express the resulting master equation in the coordinate representation and, utilizing the adiabatic elimination of fast variables, derive a completely positive hybrid quantum-classical master equation that defines OQBM.

By minimizing geometric action, LAUT guarantees dynamical fidelity and inherently enforces the preservation of symmetries--properties frequently violated by conventional Schrieffer-Wolff and Givens rotation techniques. We identify the Bloch-Brandow formalism as the natural perturbative counterpart to this principle, yielding analytic expansions that preserve symmetries to high order. We validate this framework against experimental data from superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating that LAUT quantitatively reproduces interaction rates in driven entangling gates where standard approximations diverge. Furthermore, in tunable coupler architectures, we demonstrate that the LAUT approach captures essential non-rotating-wave contributions that standard models neglect; this inclusion is critical for quantitatively reproducing interaction rates and revealing physical multi-body interactions such as $XZX+YZY$, which are verified to be physical rather than gauge artifacts.

Traditionally, this enhancement is associated with a closing energy gap, which causes the characteristic timescales for adiabatic preparation or relaxation to diverge with increasing system size. Consequently, the apparent growth of the quantum Fisher information largely reflects the increasing evolution time induced by critical slowing down, rather than a genuine gain in metrological performance, thereby severely limiting the practical usefulness of such protocols. Here we show that the relationship between energy-gap variations, quantum Fisher information, and achievable precision is far more subtle in interacting quantum systems: enhanced sensitivity does not require a vanishing gap, and, perhaps more surprisingly, a decreasing quantum Fisher information does not necessarily imply reduced precision once the time is properly taken into account. Building on this insight, we introduce an anti-critical metrology scheme that achieves enhanced precision while the energy gap increases. We illustrate this mechanism using the quantum Rabi model, thereby identifying a route to metrological advantage that avoids the critical slowing down associated with conventional criticality."}

These limitations underscore the need for computational approaches that retain first principles physical rigor while enabling efficient and scalable prediction.

For such cases, the classical Monte Carlo integration procedure provides the state-of-the-art provable, asymptotic performance: polynomial in problem dimension and quadratic in inverse-precision. While quantum algorithms are known to offer quadratic speedups over classical Monte Carlo methods, end-to-end speedups have been proven only in the simplified setting over the Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. This paper extends existing frameworks to demonstrate novel quadratic speedups for more practical models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and a variant of Heston's stochastic volatility model, utilizing a characteristic of the underlying SDEs which we term fast-forwardability. Additionally, for general models that do not possess the fast-forwardable property, we introduce a quantum Milstein sampler, based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling Lévy areas, which enables quantum multi-level Monte Carlo to achieve quadratic speedups for multi-dimensional stochastic processes exhibiting certain correlation types.\n  We also present an improved analysis of numerical integration for derivative pricing, leading to substantial reductions in the resource requirements for pricing GBM and CIR models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for additional reductions using arithmetic-free quantum procedures. Finally, we critique quantum partial differential equation (PDE) solvers as a method for derivative pricing based on amplitude estimation, identifying theoretical barriers that obstruct achieving a quantum speedup through this approach.

Most existing approaches target phase estimation and rely on a shared phase reference between the signal and the probe, yet many relevant scenarios deal with regimes where such a reference is absent, making the estimation of force or field amplitudes the main task. We study this phase-insensitive regime for bosonic sensors that undergo identical displacements with common phases randomly varying between experimental runs. We derive analytical bounds on the achievable precision and show that it is determined by first-order normal correlations between modes in the probe state, constrained by their average excitations. These correlations yield a collective sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit, with a gain that grows linearly in the total excitation number, revealing a distributed quantum advantage even without a global phase reference. We identify families of multimode states with definite joint parity that saturate this limit and can be probed efficiently via local parity measurements already demonstrated or emerging in several quantum platforms. We further demonstrate that experimentally relevant decoherence channels favor two distinct sensing strategies: splitting of a single-mode nonclassical state among the modes, which is robust to loss and heating, and separable probes, which are instead resilient to dephasing and phase jitter. Our results are relevant to multimode continuous platforms, including trapped-ion, solid-state mechanical, optomechanical, superconducting, and photonic systems."}

In this work we study dispersive readout of an inhomogeneously broadened spin ensemble via coupling to a driven resonator measured via homodyne detection. We derive generic analytic conditions for when the homodyne measurement can be limited by the fundamental spin-projection noise, as opposed to microwave-drive shot noise or resonator phase noise.

However, passive reset occurs on timescales that are much longer than those of gate operations and measurements, making it a significant bottleneck for algorithmic execution. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting the Mpemba effect, originally indicating the faster cooling of hot systems compared to cooler ones. Focusing on the regime where coherence times exceed energy relaxation times ($T_2 > T_1$), we propose a simple protocol based on a single entangling two-qubit gate that converts local single-qubit coherences into fast-decaying global two-qubit coherences. This removes their overlap with the slowest decaying Liouvillian mode and enables a substantially faster relaxation to the ground state. For realistic parameters, we find that our protocol can reduce reset times by up to $50\\%$ compared to standard passive reset. We analyze the robustness of the protocol under non-Markovian noise, imperfect coherent control and finite temperature, finding that the accelerated reset persists across a broad range of realistic error sources. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of our protocol on an IQM superconducting quantum processor.

We found a quantum critical point at $λ_c \\approx 2.72$ to $2.93$, with critical exponents $z\\approx0.84$, $ν\\approx 1.12 $, $β\\approx 0.30$, and $γ\\approx 2.54$. The lower dynamical exponent $z$ indicates that quantum fluctuations slow down due to fractal geometry, yielding an effective critical dimension of about 2.43. The numerical renormalization group method yielded similar results $λ_c = 2.765$, $β= 0.306$, supporting our findings. These exponents differ from those in both the one-dimensional and mean-field cases."}

We propose a physically transparent framework in which NQS are treated as neural approximations to latent imaginary-time evolution. This viewpoint suggests that standard Transformer-based NQS (TQS) architectures correspond to physically unmotivated effective Hamiltonians dependent on imaginary time in a latent space. Building on this interpretation, we introduce physics-inspired transformer quantum states (PITQS), which enforce a static effective Hamiltonian by sharing weights across layers and improve propagation accuracy via Trotter-Suzuki decompositions without increasing the number of variational parameters. For the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, our ansätze achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art TQS while using substantially fewer variational parameters. This study demonstrates that reinterpreting the deep network structure as a latent cooling process enables a more physically grounded, systematic, and compact design, thereby bridging the gap between black-box expressivity and physically transparent construction."}

Current experiments with ultracold polar molecules employ shielding with microwave or static electric fields to prevent destructive collisional losses. The interaction potential of microwave-shielded molecules can be tuned by using microwaves of two different polarisations, while for static-field-shielded molecules the tunability of interactions is more limited and depends on the particular species. In this work, we propose a general method to tune the interactions between static-field-shielded molecules by applying a microwave field. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations in a field-dressed basis set to determine loss rate coefficients and scattering lengths. We find that both the s-wave scattering length and the dipole length can be widely tuned by changing the parameters of the microwave field, while maintaining strong suppression of lossy collisions."}

While the magnetic moment of a ferromagnet aligns with an applied magnetic field, it has been experimentally shown that the magnetic order can be inverted by injecting spin current into the magnet. This results in an energetically unstable but dynamically stabilized state where the magnetic moment aligns antiparallel to an applied magnetic field, called the inverted magnetic state. The excitations on top of such a state have negative energy and are called antimagnons. The inverted state is subject to fluctuations, in particular, as shot noise in the spin current, which are different from fluctuations in equilibrium, especially at low temperatures. Here, we theoretically study the fluctuations of the inverted magnetic state and their signatures in experimental setups. We find that the fluctuations from the injection of spin current play a large role. In the quantum regime, the inverted magnetic state exhibits larger fluctuations compared to the equilibrium position, which can be probed using a qubit. Our results advance the understanding of the fundamental properties of antimagnons and their experimental controllability, and they pave the way for applications in spintronics and magnonics, such as spin wave amplification and entanglement."}

Unlike standard thermal reservoirs, this environment acts as a dynamic bath, capable of simultaneously exchanging heat and performing work. We formulate a thermodynamic framework for this semi-classical regime, defining heat, work, and entropy production. We derive a modified Second Law that accounts for non-equilibrium quantum features, such as squeezing. The framework is exemplified by an optomechanical setup, where we characterize the thermodynamics of the non-stationary noise induced by the cavity field."}

While the BCS, Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO), and normal phases occupy different regions on the phase diagram when the parameters are uniform, a spatial change of pairing strength or spin polarization can drive the system from the FFLO phase to a normal gas or from a BCS superfluid to the FFLO phase in real space. The FFLO phase exhibits its signature modulating order parameter at the FFLO momentum due to population imbalance, and the pair correlation penetrates the polarized normal phase and exhibits proximity effects. Meanwhile, the BCS phase tends to repel population imbalance and maintain a plateau of pairing. Interestingly, a buffer FFLO phase emerges when the spatial change attempts to join the BCS and normal phase in the presence of spin polarization. By analyzing the pairing correlations, interfacial properties, and momentum-space spectra of the inhomogeneous structures, relevant length- and momentum- scales and their interplay are characterized. We also briefly discuss implications of inhomogeneous multi-phase atomic Fermi gases with population imbalance."}

We study this phenomenon using a two-dimensional interacting and coherently coupled Bose-Bose mixture, a platform that has already been employed experimentally to investigate false vacuum decay in one dimension. In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable. Using the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), we prepare thermal equilibrium states in the false vacuum and extract decay rates from the magnetization dynamics. The decay rates show an exponential dependence on temperature, in line with the thermal theory of instantons. Since the SGPE is based on complex scalar fields, it also allows us to explore the behavior of the phase, which turns out to become dynamic during decay. Our results confirm the SGPE as an effective tool for studying coupled magnetization and phase dynamics and the associated instanton physics in ultracold quantum gases."}

Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapted ansatz enforcing conservation of particle number $(N)$, spin projection $(S_z=0)$, and total spin $(S^2=0)$ symmetry, benchmarking the performance against exact diagonalization across different interaction strengths using bath parameters extracted from the DMFT self-consistency loop. For a four-site model, the relative error in the ground state energy remains well below $0.01%$ with a compact parameter set $(N_p \\le 30)$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the single-particle Green's function-the central quantity for DMFT-can be accurately extracted from VQE-prepared ground states via real-time evolution in the intermediate to strong interaction regimes. However, in the weak interaction regime, the Green's function exhibits noticeable deviations from the exact benchmark, particularly in resolving low-energy spectral features, despite the ground state energy showing excellent agreement. These findings demonstrate that VQE combined with real-time evolution can effectively extend quantum-classical hybrid DMFT beyond the two-site approximation, particularly for describing insulating phases. While this approach offers a viable pathway for simulating strongly correlated materials on near-term devices, the observation that accurate ground state energy does not guarantee accurate dynamical properties highlights a key challenge for applying such approaches to correlated metals."}

Depending on whether this condensation preserves or breaks the $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry, the system undergoes a transition to a quantum Hall hierarchy state or to an anyon superconductor. For anyon superconductors, the condensate charge is determined unambiguously by the charged local bosons contained in the condensable algebra.
