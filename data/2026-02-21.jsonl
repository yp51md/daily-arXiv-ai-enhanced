In this work, the influence of the electrical properties on heat transfer across metal/doped semiconductor junctions is investigated. Specifically, thermal boundary conductance at the interfaces between p- and n-doped silicon and titanium is measured by employing frequency-domain photothermal radiometry under varying external conditions. The influence of the doping level of the semiconductor, the barrier height, and the space charge area is analyzed. In particular, a 40% increase in the interface thermal conductance with the application of a current at n-doped silicon/titanium interfaces is reported. The enhancement of the thermal boundary conductance is explained by the shrinking of the surface charga area induced by the electric current. This study opens the way to modulating interfacial heat transfer at metal/semiconductor interfaces through fine tuning of electrical effects."}

Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling."}

One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs."}

Field-cooling from above the Néel temperature is a reliable yet slow re-pinning method in exchange-biased systems. For on-demand reprogrammable devices, localized and rapid exchange bias repinning methods are essential. Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature. We expand the use of our model by identifying material platforms and stack designs that lead to optimized performance, aiding further development of optically reprogrammable devices."}

Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing."}

Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \\approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \\approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system.

The electrical characterization focuses on comparing different test structures and extraction methods for mobility, contact resistance, IV-curve hysteresis and doping parameters. The comparison shows that the selected measurement test structures and analysis methods can have a large impact on the extracted values and should thus be considered when comparing data sets between different sources.

We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges.

Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current."}

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation."}

A promising direction to realize systems exhibiting novel universal behavior beyond TLL is through the generalization of the underlying Fermi sea. In this Letter, we show that fractional Fermi seas with reduced occupancy arise in an integrable Bose gas driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in interactions from repulsive to attractive.

Quantum annealing is recommended when the problem formulation QUBO exhibits a high gradient variance (greater than 0.3) and the energy landscape contains numerous thin barriers characterized by sharp peaks and narrow valleys. Additionally, quantum approaches are particularly suitable when classical methods are observed to get trapped in local minima, the problem size is manageable given hardware constraints (less than 5000 variables for pure quantum annealing), and the time overhead of approximately 10 seconds is acceptable for the application.\n  In contrast, classical methods are recommended when the gradient variance is low (less than 0.2), indicating smooth landscapes where quantum tunneling provides little advantage. Classical approaches are also preferable when the problem size is small and classical solvers can provide nearly instantaneous results, when solution quality requirements are modest and local optima suffice, or when hardware access or cost is a limiting factor.\n  For problems that exceed pure quantum capacity but possess a favorable landscape structure, hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical techniques are recommended. Such hybrid methods are particularly effective when decomposition quality can be verified and both solution quality and scalability are important considerations."}

However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation."}

Current QEC controllers execute all scheduled syndrome (parity-bit) measurement rounds before decoding, even when early syndrome data indicates that the run will result in an error. The resulting excess measurements increase the decoder's workload and system latency. To address this, we introduce an adaptive abort module that simultaneously reduces decoder overhead and suppresses logical error rates in surface codes and color codes under an existing QEC controller. The key idea is that initial syndrome information allows the controller to terminate risky shots early before additional resources are spent. An effective scheme balances the cost of further measurement against the restart cost and thus increases decoder efficiency.\n  Adaptive abort schemes dynamically adjust the number of syndrome measurement rounds per shot using real-time syndrome information. We consider three schemes: fixed-depth (FD) decoding (the standard non-adaptive approach used in current state-of-the-art QEC controllers), and two adaptive schemes, AdAbort and One-Step Lookahead (OSLA) decoding. For surface and color codes under a realistic circuit-level depolarizing noise model, AdAbort substantially outperforms both OSLA and FD, yielding higher decoder efficiency across a broad range of code distances. Numerically, as the code distance increases from 5 to 15, AdAbort yields an improvement that increases from 5% to 35% for surface codes and from 7% to 60% for color codes.\n  To our knowledge, these are the first adaptive abort schemes considered for QEC. Our results highlight the potential importance of abort rules for increasing efficiency as we scale to large, resource-intensive quantum architectures."}

Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing."}

Using similarity transformations, we determine the conditions yielding real energy spectra and skin effect, and identify the emergence of exceptional points where spectra transition from real to complex. We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges. These findings reveal the sensitivity of spectral and localization properties to boundary conditions, providing a framework for engineering quantum lattice models with tailored spectral and localization features, with potential applications in quantum devices."}

One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs."}

This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias."}

Results with much better quality compared with previous works have been achieved. With the thermodynamic limit results obtained at ease, we also discuss the future usage of our method to clarify the questions on the instability of fractional quantum Hall states in an ideal Chern band setting or under quantum decoherence."}

Through initializing the battery in either the symmetric or broken symmetry phases of the LMG model we analyze how the different spectral properties can affect the performance of both the charging and discharging of the battery. In particular, we show that by quenching the magnetic field strength from the symmetric phase to the broken phase, we can achieve a significant enhancement in stored energy, as well as stable and efficient ergotropy extraction. Similar observations can be made when introducing weak coupling between the battery with the bosonic bath, while the amount of stored work and ergotropy saturate at strong coupling. These findings emphasize the importance of the magnetic field dynamics and environmental coupling in optimizing charging performance, which could lead to practical applications in quantum energy storage."}

Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($μ$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device.

The game structures corresponding to generic experiments such as fixed-causal-order process matrices or causal contextuality scenarios, together with a deterministic non-Nashian resolution algorithm that abandons unilateral deviation assumptions (free choice) and assumes Perfect Prediction instead, were described in previous work.\n  In this new research, we learn the reward functions of the game, which contain a hidden variable, using neural networks. The cost function is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the frequency histograms obtained through many deterministic runs of the game and the predictions of the extended Born rule.\n  Using our framework on the specific case of the EPR 2-2-2 experiment acts as a proof-of-concept and a toy local-realist hidden-variable model that non-Nashian quantum theory is a promising avenue towards a local hidden-variable theory.

The obstruction is intrinsic: with finite sampling, normalization becomes a statistical bottleneck, and support mismatch between numerator and denominator estimators can render the empirical objective ill-conditioned and even sub-variational. Moreover, to reproduce the ground state with constant-depth ansatzes or with linear-depth circuits forming unitary 2-designs, the required reweighting range (and hence the sampling cost) grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Motivated by this no-go result, we develop a normalization-free alternative, the unitary variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (U-VQNHE).

While teleportation from CV to DV can be achieved with near-unit success probability, the reverse process is usually limited to a maximum success probability of $1/2$. We demonstrate that, by employing cross-Kerr nonlinearity together with passive linear optical components such as polarizing beam splitters, beam splitters, and phase shifters, almost perfect teleportation from DV to CV encodings can also be achieved."}

We show that the Krylov bounds converge to the QFI exponentially fast with increasing order and can surpass the state-of-the-art polynomial lower bounds known to date. Moreover, we show that certain low-order Krylov bound can already match the QFI exactly for low-rank states prevalent in practical settings. Such exact match is beyond the reach of polynomial lower bounds proposed previously.

We employ two methods to construct the Hilbert space: Method A, based on the standard second-quantization formalism, and Method B, based on a non-standard approach. By eliminating redundant quantum states, we obtain a reduced Hilbert space with significantly lower dimensionality, thereby improving the efficiency of numerical simulations. In a closed system, the two methods are equivalent, and their unitary evolution results are identical. The probability distribution diffuses outward from the center and exhibits a significant rebound after reaching the boundary. In an open system, Method B, by incorporating more dissipation channels, provides a more accurate description of the photon escape process at the boundary. The probability curves obtained from the two methods completely overlap before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, a slight difference appears, but this difference does not amplify with evolution and tends to converge in the later stage. Method B yields a slightly higher dissipative-state probability, indicating that the photon escapes faster. Visualization of the two-dimensional probability distribution shows that the three scenarios (closed system, open system with Method A, and open system with Method B) exhibit identical probability distributions before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, the open systems exhibit significant probability loss, which increases rapidly with evolution. The probability distribution patterns of the two open systems are highly similar, exhibiting synchronized evolution."}

We determine both the exact depolarisation noise rate and the measurement loss rate at which the all projective measurements in $d$-dimensional quantum theory admit a classical model. For finite sets of quantum measurements we develop methods both for constructing classical models and for falsifying the existence of such model via prepare-and-measure setups. Furthermore, we show that this concept also has operational implications. For that, we consider whether quantum measurements with classical side-information can be implemented in sequence without causing a disturbance and we show that classical models imply an affirmative answer.

This iterative strategy significantly improves solution quality, achieving consistent constraint satisfaction while yielding better cut sizes across a wide range of instances. These findings highlight both the limitations of current PCE formulations for constrained problems and the effectiveness of iterative strategies for advancing quantum optimization in the NISQ era."}

In the language of mathematics, such a quantum catastrophe occurs at an exceptional point of order $N$ (EPN). Although the Hamiltonian $H(g)$ itself becomes unphysical in the limit of $g \\to g^{EPN}$, it is shown that it can play the role of an unperturbed operator in a perturbation-approximation analysis of the vicinity of the EPN singularity. Such an analysis is elementary at $N\\leq 3$ and numerical at $N\\geq 5$, so we pick up $N=4$. We demonstrate that the specific EP4 degeneracy becomes accessible via a unitary evolution process realizable inside a parametric domain ${\\cal D}_{\\rm physical}$, the boundaries of which are determined non-numerically.

Although not a genuine entanglement measure, both TE and OE are connected to the efficiency of matrix product state simulations and thus of fundamental interest. As in many quantum algorithms, at the end of the Grover circuit entanglement decreases as the system converges towards the target product state. While we find that this is well captured in the OE dynamics, quantum trajectories rarely follow paths of reducing entanglement. Optimized unraveling schemes can lower TE slightly, however we show that deep in the circuit OE is generally smaller than TE. This implies that matrix product density operator (MPDO) simulations of quantum circuits can in general be more efficient than quantum trajectories. In addition, we investigate the noise-rate scaling of success probabilities for both amplitude-damping and phase-flip noise in Grover's algorithm."}

Mannheim"], "title": "States that grow linearly in time, exceptional points, and zero norm states in the simple harmonic oscillator", "comment": "7 pages, revtex 4", "summary": "The simple harmonic oscillator has a well-known normalizable, positive energy, bound state spectrum. We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector. This thus not quite so simple harmonic oscillator provides an explicit realization of our general contention that antilinearity is more basic to quantum theory than Hermiticity."}

Our scheme requires only two-mode squeezing, passive optics, and static homodyne measurements, and enables post-hoc classical estimation of many properties from the same experimental dataset. We prove that our protocol enables a quantum speedup for common classical sensing tasks, including measuring electromagnetic correlations, real-time feedback control of interferometric cavities, and Fourier-domain matched filtering. To establish these separations, we introduce an optimal-transport conditioning method, and show both worst-case exponential separations from all entanglement-free strategies and practical speedups over homodyne and heterodyne baselines. We further show that when squeezing is treated as a resource, a protocol with squeezed light can sense a structured classical background exponentially faster than any coherent classical probe."}

We introduce the Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver (SEGQE) as a greedy, shadow-assisted framework for measurement-efficient ground-state preparation. SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates. Together, our empirical scaling laws and rigorous per-iteration guarantees establish SEGQE as a measurement-efficient state-preparation primitive well suited to early fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures."}

This is the case for a canonical problem: estimating the amplitude and frequency of an AC magnetic field, where the generators are parallel to each other. Here, we introduce a quantum control protocol that resolves this singularity. Our control protocol strategically engineers the sensor's time evolution so the generators for the two parameters become orthogonal. It not only removes the singularity but also restores the optimal scaling of precision with interrogation time for both parameters simultaneously. We experimentally validate this protocol using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at room temperature, demonstrating the concurrent achievement of the optimal scaling for both parameters under realistic conditions."}

A promising direction to realize systems exhibiting novel universal behavior beyond TLL is through the generalization of the underlying Fermi sea. In this Letter, we show that fractional Fermi seas with reduced occupancy arise in an integrable Bose gas driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in interactions from repulsive to attractive.
