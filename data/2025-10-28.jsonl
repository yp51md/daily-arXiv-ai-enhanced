Here we extend this computations\nto higher orders: assuming that the only relevant parameter specifying the\ninteraction potential is the $s$-wave scattering length $a_0$, we compute the\ncomplete order $(k_{\\rm F}a_0)^3$ ($k_{\\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave vector)\ncontribution to the system's free energy as a function of the numbers $N_+$ and\n$N_-$ of spin up and spin down fermions (i.e. as a function of its\npolarization) and the temperature $T$. We also extend the computation beyond a\nfixed order by resumming the contributions to $F$ of two infinite sets of\nFeynman diagrams: the so called particle-particle rings and the particle-hole\nrings.

The correct order parameter is\n$z_k=\\sqrt{\\bigl|\\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\\,\\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$\nFourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$\nFourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle\nintegration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields\nthat contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$\nexhibits $z_k \\propto \\varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes\n$k\\le30$), where $\\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$. This provides strong evidence that\nthe 1/2 scaling holds for all Fourier modes.

Understanding how its computational complexity\nrelates to underlying dynamics is crucial for both theoretical insight and\npractical utility, yet remains largely unexplored despite a few case studies.\nHere, we address this question for a family of brickwork quantum circuits\nranging from integrable to chaotic regimes. Using tools from geometric group\ntheory, we identify three qualitatively distinct scalings of temporal\nentanglement entropy, establishing a hierarchy of computational resources\nrequired for accurate tensor-network representations of the IM for these\nmodels. We further analyze the memory structure of the IM and distinguish\nbetween classical and quantum temporal correlations. In particular, for certain\nexamples, we identify effectively classical IMs that admit an efficient Monte\nCarlo algorithm for computing multitime correlations. In more generic settings\nwithout an explicit classical description of the IM, we introduce an\noperational measure of quantum memory with an experimental protocol, and\ndiscuss examples exhibiting long-time genuinely quantum correlations.

For fractional Chern insulators, existing\nstudies suggest that making flat Chern bands closely resemble the lowest Landau\nlevel (LLL) seems to maximize the excitation gap, providing an apparently\noptimal platform. In this work, we demonstrate that deforming away from the LLL\nlimit can, in fact, produce substantially larger FQH gaps. Using moir\\'e flat\nbands with strongly non-Landau-level wavefunctions, we show that the gap can\nexceed that of the LLL by more than two orders of magnitude for short-range\ninteractions and by factors of two to three for long-range interactions. This\nenhancement is generic across Abelian FCI states and follows a universal\nenhancement factor within each hierarchy. Using the Landau level framework, we\nidentify the amplification of pseudopotentials as the microscopic origin of the\nobserved enhancement. This finding demonstrates that pseudopotential\nengineering can substantially strengthen fractional topological phases. We\nfurther examined non-Abelian states and found that, within finite-size\nresolution, this wavefunction construction method can also be used to\nmanipulate and enhance the gap for certain interaction parameters."}

In this work we propose a setup in which the\nmemory time can be utilized to control the generation and storage of binary\ninformation. In particular, we consider a nonequilibrium Brownian particle\nimmersed in a viscoelastic environment and dwelling in a spatially periodic\npotential. We interpret its average velocity as a bit and show that depending\non the memory time characterizing the viscoelastic bath the particle can be\neither in one of two stable states representing the bit values or in a chaotic\nstate in which the information is erased and a new bit can be generated. We\nanalyze randomness of the so obtained bit sequence and assess the stability of\nthe produced values. Our study provides a blueprint for storing and processing\ninformation in a microscopic system using its memory."}
