They can also induce long-range entanglement between\nunmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many\nnon-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and\nusing the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new\napproach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create\nshort-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a\nsuperconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range\nentanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the\nothers. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on\nobservations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by\ncorrelating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced\nentanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability\nof a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely\nrelated to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work\ncan act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more\ngeneral problems in quantum control."}

For translation-invariant\nquadratic fermionic chains with interactions extending to $m$ neighbors and\nperiodic boundary conditions, the Loschmidt amplitude admits a unitary\nmatrix-model / Toeplitz representation, which yields a work variable of the\nform $W=\\sum_{r\\le m} a_r\\,\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\,U^r$ (and in models with\npairing terms -- superconducting pairing -- additional\n$b_r\\,\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\,U^r$ terms appear). By invoking multivariate\ncentral limit theorems for vectors of traces of unitaries, we obtain a Gaussian\ndistribution for $P(W)$ with variance $\\mathrm{Var}(W)=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_r\nr\\,(a_r^2+b_r^2)$ and asymptotic independence across different powers.

We illustrate these mechanisms in the XY chain.\nVarious numerical diagnostics support the analytical results."}

Practically, to execute such quantum circuits, we need to pass\ncommands to a programmable quantum computer. Existing programming approaches,\ndedicated to generic unitary transformations, are inefficient in terms of the\ncomputational resources under the low-depth assumption and remain far from\nsatisfactory. As such, to realize NISQ algorithms, it is crucial to find an\nefficient way to program low-depth circuits as the qubit number $N$ increases.\nHere, we investigate the gate complexity and the size of quantum memory (known\nas the program cost) required to program low-depth brickwork circuits. We\nunveil a $\\sim N \\text{poly} \\log N$ worst-case program cost of universal\nprogramming of low-depth brickwork circuits in the large $N$ regime, which is a\ntight characterization. Moreover, we analyze the trade-off between the cost of\ndescribing the layout of local gates and the cost of programming them to the\ntargeted unitaries via the light-cone argument. Our findings suggest that\nfaithful gate-wise programming is optimal in the low-depth regime."}

In this paper, we\npropose a three-layer fat-tree network architecture for QDCs, designed to\naddress these challenges. Our architecture features a unique leaf switch and an\nadvanced swapping spine switch design, optimized to handle high volumes of\nentanglement requests as well as a queue scheduling mechanism that efficiently\nmanages quantum memory to prevent decoherence.

Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to\nweak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry\nBreaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric\ndensity matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric\nrandom quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site\nrepresentation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be\nregarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to\nmore general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak\npostselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order\ntransition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly\nsymmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases\nand their transitions for both abelian $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$\nsymmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with\nmeasurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent\nin the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum\nchannels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the\ndegeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries. Our results\ndemonstrate robust SW-SSB phases and their transitions in the steady states of\nnoisy quantum operations, and provide a framework for realizing various kinds\nof mixed-state quantum phases based on their symmetries."}
