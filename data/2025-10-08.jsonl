While the\nproperties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general\ndescription of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature,\nwhich leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons.\nIn this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between\nWannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two\nground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This\npotential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the\nparticles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it\nbecomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two\ninteracting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a\ngeneralization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including\ncorrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large\ndistances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the\ninteractions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a\nmany-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that\nformally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field\nrepresenting the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal\nexchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the\ndiagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our\nvariational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay\nthe groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and\ntheir application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic\nmatter."}

At its heart is\nthe explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and\nbetween the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM\nalso enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music\ncompositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.\n  Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a\nBell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live\nperformed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily\nrelied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately\ncapture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the\nfundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based\ntechnique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition,\nbut also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new\ntemplate for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.\n  All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is\npowerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in\nterms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of\nWestern classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different\ngenres and directions."}

We find that those\ncorrections slightly change both the properties of the equilibrium state and\nthe rapidity measurements. Remarkably, however, the changes nearly cancel each\nother, resulting in measured rapidity distributions that are very close to\nthose predicted in the absence of the intertube DDI."}

We\nstudy the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed\nsyndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical\nfailures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes.\nTherefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome\npatterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate\ncan be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \\geq 2$ in general; in the\nspecific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find\nnumerically that $b = 3.1(1)$.

As was recognized by Nagaoka in the\n1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to\nferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration\ninstead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a\n120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and\ntriangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order\nbecomes unstable to a spin spiral.

While the\nproperties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general\ndescription of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature,\nwhich leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons.\nIn this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between\nWannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two\nground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This\npotential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the\nparticles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it\nbecomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two\ninteracting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a\ngeneralization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including\ncorrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large\ndistances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the\ninteractions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a\nmany-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that\nformally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field\nrepresenting the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal\nexchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the\ndiagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our\nvariational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay\nthe groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and\ntheir application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic\nmatter."}

In chaotic systems,\nthermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis\n(ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state\nshould exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected\nto retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs\nensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable\nspin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a\ncanonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial,\nexhibiting a \"double plateau\" structure. We solve this process exactly using\ntechniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact\nnumerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically\nexact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the\nmacroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's\nanomalous pairing correlations."}

These systems are typically\noperated dynamically under nonequilibrium conditions, giving rise to coupled\nelectronic and photonic currents. Understanding the joint fluctuation behavior\nof these currents is essential for assessing the performance of light-matter\ninterfaces that rely on electron-photon correlations. Here, we investigate the\nfull counting statistics of coupled electronic and photonic currents in an\nexperimentally feasible hybrid system composed of a double quantum dot coupled\nto an optical cavity. We employ the framework of quantum Lindblad master\nequation which is augmented with both electronic and photonic counting fields\nto derive their joint cumulant generating function--a treatment that differs\nsignificantly from existing studies, which typically focus on either electron\nor photon statistics separately. We reveal that the ratio between photonic and\nelectronic currents, as well as their variances, can deviate from an expected\nquadratic scaling law in the large electron-photon coupling regime.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that conventional modelings of photonic dissipation\nchannels in quantum master equations must be modified to ensure that the joint\ncumulant generating function satisfies the fluctuation symmetry enforced by the\nfluctuation theorem. Our results advance the understanding of joint fluctuation\nbehaviors in electron-photon hybrid systems and may inform the design of\nefficient quantum light-matter interfaces."}
