### [1] [Causal Interventions Beyond Time: A CP-do(C)-Calculus for Indefinite Quantum Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04737)
*Jordi Vallverdu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 将Pearl的do-calculus三规则重新表述为完全正（CP）保迹映射语言，扩展至量子纠缠系统，发现Rule 2在因果序不确定时失效，并通过三量子比特电路验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将经典因果建模工具扩展到量子系统，尤其是纠缠和因果序不确定的情况。

Method: 使用完全正（CP）保迹映射重新表述do-calculus规则，并在三量子比特电路中验证Rule 2的失效。

Result: Rule 2在因果序不确定时失效，需重新定义经典因果概念如干预、忠实性和反事实依赖。

Conclusion: 提出的CP-do($C$)-calculus为经典、确定序量子及不确定序量子因果建模提供了统一框架。

Abstract: We reformulate Pearl's three rules of do-calculus in the language of
completely positive (CP) trace-preserving maps, thereby extending them to
quantum systems with entanglement. We prove that Rule~2 fails whenever the
underlying process admits indefinite causal order, and we demonstrate this
failure in a three-qubit ``quantum switch'' circuit. Our analysis clarifies why
the classical notions of surgical intervention, faithfulness, and
counterfactual dependence must be revised in quantum information science. The
CP-do($C$)-calculus introduced here provides a common syntax for causal
modelling across classical, definite-order quantum, and indefinite-order
quantum regimes.

### [2] [Comment on "Energy-speed relationship of quantum particles challenges Bohmian mechanics"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04756)
*Aurélien Drezet,Dustin Lazarovici,Bernard Michael Nabet*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文反驳了Sharaglazova等人的实验结论，认为其与玻姆力学一致，并澄清了实验速度与玻姆力学速度的定义差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回应Sharaglazova等人的实验发现，证明其与玻姆力学不冲突，并纠正误解。

Method: 基于标准玻姆力学单粒子引导方程进行分析。

Result: 实验观测的速度与玻姆力学定义的速度无关，实验结果与玻姆力学一致。

Conclusion: Sharaglazova等人的结论错误，玻姆力学仍有效。

Abstract: In their recent paper [Nature 643, 67 (2025)], Sharaglazova et al. report an
optical microcavity experiment yielding an "energy-speed relationship" for
quantum particles in evanescent states, which they infer from the observed
population transfer between two coupled waveguides. The authors argue that
their findings challenge the validity of Bohmian particle dynamics because,
according to the Bohmian guiding equation, the velocities in the classically
forbidden region would be zero. In this note, we explain why this claim is
false and the experimental findings are in perfect agreement with Bohmian
mechanics. We also clarify why the operationally defined speeds reported in the
paper are unrelated to particle velocities in the sense described by Bohmian
mechanics. In contrast to other recent replies, our analysis relies solely on
the standard Bohmian guidance equation for single particles.

### [3] [Universal quantum phase classification on quantum computers from machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04774)
*Weicheng Ye,Shuwei Liu,Shiyu Zhou,Yijian Zou*

Result: 在一维量子自旋链（如Ising模型和ANNNI模型）中验证了方法的普适性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需依赖局域序参数，实现了通用的量子相分类。

Abstract: The classification of quantum phases of matter remains a fundamental
challenge in condensed matter physics. We present a novel framework that
combines shadow tomography with modern time-series machine learning models to
enable efficient and practical quantum phase classification. Our approach
leverages the definition of quantum phases based on connectivity through
finite-depth local unitary circuits, generating abundant training data by
applying Haar random evolution to representative quantum states for a given
phase. In this way, the training data can be efficiently obtained from a
quantum simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that advanced time-series
models can be used to process the training data and achieve universal quantum
phase classification that does not rely on local order parameters. To validate
the universality and versatility of our method, we test the model against
one-dimensional quantum spin chains such as the Ising model and the axial
next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, showing excellent agreement with
known phase boundaries.

### [4] [Power and Limitations of Linear Programming Decoder for Quantum LDPC Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04769)

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子纠错码解码是实现容错量子计算的关键挑战，线性规划解码器在经典领域表现优异，但在量子码中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究揭示了LP解码对量子低密度奇偶校验（LDPC）码的局限性，提出结合OSD后处理技术以提升解码性能。

Result: 实验表明，结合OSD的LP解码在中等规模量子码（数百量子比特）上优于传统信念传播方法。

Conclusion: 结合有效后处理的LP解码器为近期量子LDPC码解码提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Decoding quantum error-correcting codes is a key challenge in enabling
fault-tolerant quantum computation. In the classical setting, linear
programming (LP) decoders offer provable performance guarantees and can
leverage fast practical optimization algorithms. Although LP decoders have been
proposed for quantum codes, their performance and limitations remain relatively
underexplored. In this work, we uncover a key limitation of LP decoding for
quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes: certain constant-weight error
patterns lead to ambiguous fractional solutions that cannot be resolved through
independent rounding. To address this issue, we incorporate a post-processing
technique known as ordered statistics decoding (OSD), which significantly
enhances LP decoding performance in practice. Our results show that LP
decoding, when augmented with OSD, can outperform belief propagation with the
same post-processing for intermediate code sizes of up to hundreds of qubits.
These findings suggest that LP-based decoders, equipped with effective
post-processing, offer a promising approach for decoding near-term quantum LDPC
codes.

### [5] [Optimal Qubit Purification and Unitary Schur Sampling via Random SWAP Tests](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05046)
*Shrigyan Brahmachari,Austin Hulse,Henry D. Pfister,Iman Marvian*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于随机SWAP测试的简单协议，用于量子比特纯化，其性能与最优的Schur变换相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是利用多个噪声量子比特的未知纯态，通过纯化获得更接近纯态的量子比特。

Method: 使用仅基于随机SWAP测试的协议，通过识别和隔离单态对，逐步纯化剩余量子比特。

Result: 在约$T \approx n \ln n$次测试后，检测新单态的概率指数下降，剩余量子比特的保真度接近最优值。

Conclusion: 该协议实现了弱Schur采样和酉Schur采样，是量子态层析和计量等任务的强大子程序。

Abstract: The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an
unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the
pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests
achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This
protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair
of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate
singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$
qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests,
a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet
decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining
qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error
that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what
is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error
$\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it
provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under
permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as
quantum state tomography and metrology.

### [6] [Ergotopy transport in a one dimensional spin chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04770)
*Dara Murphy,Anthony Kiely,Irene D'Amico,Steve Campbell*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了可调交换耦合的自旋链中有用能量（即可提取功，由ergotropy量化）的传输，比较了均匀相互作用强度和完美状态传输（PST）耦合的两种极限情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同耦合方式对自旋链中ergotropy传输效率的影响，特别是量子相干性初始状态的优势。

Method: 通过将自旋链的各个部分建模为量子电池，分析初始状态（量子相干或布居反转）对ergotropy传输的影响，并比较PST与非PST耦合的性能。

Result: 非PST耦合下，量子相干初始状态能更高效传输ergotropy；PST耦合在无序情况下更稳定，且工作成本波动较小。

Conclusion: 量子相干初始状态在ergotropy传输中具有明显优势，PST耦合在稳定性和工作成本方面表现更优。

Abstract: We examine the transport of useful energy, i.e. extractable work as
quantified by the ergotropy, along a spin chain with tuneable exchange
couplings between the sites. We focus on, and interpolate between, the two
physically relevant limits of uniform interaction strengths and engineered
couplings which achieve perfect state transfer (PST). By modelling the
individual constituents as quantum batteries, we consider how the manner in
which the extractable work appears in the initial state of the first site
impacts the chain's ability to transport ergotropy to the final site. For
non-PST couplings, we establish that there is a clear quantum advantage when
the ergotropy is initially endowed in quantum coherences and demonstrate that
this ergotropy is more efficiently transferred. For extractable work encoded in
a population inverted state, we show that this considerably limits the length
of chain over which any ergotropy can be faithfully transported. For PST
couplings, we consider the robustness to disorder and again demonstrate a
quantum advantage for coherently endowed ergotropy. Finally, we examine the
work probability distribution associated with quenching on the interactions
which provides insight into the work cost in switching on the couplings. We
show that PST couplings lead to smaller fluctuations in this work cost,
indicating that they are more stable.

Result: PPE的统计波动能准确追踪信息扰动的因果光锥，其概率分布（PoPs）显示出不同的动力学阶段，且对丢弃区域大小表现出指数敏感性。

Conclusion: PPE是研究信息扰动和深度热化的有力工具，能够区分遍历性和多体局域化（MBL）体系的动力学特征。

Abstract: Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum
many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach
thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading.
Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement
outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of
thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy
ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a
framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted
on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced
on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement,
tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded
outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the
PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing
how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we
demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs)
associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an
experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs
display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting
exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate
these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics
in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our
analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic
results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones
characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics,
establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep
thermalisation.

Conclusion: 论文为AME态的生成和应用提供了全面的技术综述，扩展了现有方法并总结了最新进展。

Abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled (AME) pure states of a system composed of $N$
parties are distinguished by the property that for any splitting at least one
partial trace is maximally mixed. Due to maximal possible correlations between
any two selected subsystems these states have numerous applications in various
fields of quantum information processing including multi-user teleportation,
quantum error correction and secret sharing. We present an updated survey of
various techniques to generate such strongly entangled states, including those
going beyond the standard construction of graph and stabilizer states. Our
contribution includes, in particular, analysis of the degree of entanglement of
reduced states obtained by partial trace of AME projectors, states obtained by
a symmetric superposition of GHZ states, an orthogonal frequency square
representation of the "golden" AME state and an updated summary of the number
of local unitary equivalence classes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了在一维自由费米子系统中，投影测量对淬火动力学中二分纠缠熵的影响，分析了单次和周期性多次测量对两类初始态的影响，并提出了经典和量子贡献的解释。

Conclusion: 研究结果扩展了对称分辨纠缠和全计数统计的已知结论，并提供了对测量影响纠缠的物理理解。

Abstract: We consider the effect of projective measurements on the quench dynamics of
the bipartite entanglement entropy in one dimensional free fermionic systems.
In our protocol, we consider projective measurements of a $U(1)$ conserved
charge, the particle number, on some large subsystem, and study the
entanglement entropies between the same subsystem and its complement. We
compare the dynamics emanating from two classes of initial states, one which is
an eigenstate of the charge and another which is not. Moreover, we consider the
effects of a single measurement as well as multiple which are periodically
performed. Using the quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytic expressions for
the behaviour of the entanglement which admit a transparent physical
interpretation. In general, we find that measurements introduce two distinct
types of corrections to the entanglement, which can be interpreted separately
as classical and quantum contributions. The classical contribution is
independent of the measurement outcome and scales logarithmically with variance
of the charge distribution. In contrast, the quantum contribution depends on
the specific measurement outcome and can be significant for individual
realizations; however, it becomes negligible when averaged over all possible
outcomes. Our expressions reduce to previously known results for symmetry
resolved entanglement and full counting statistics in some relevant limits, and
are confirmed by an exact calculation performed on the N\'eel initial state.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模量子处理器中不可避免地存在缺陷组件，需要一种方法在不影响性能的情况下处理这些缺陷。

Method: 采用最小侵入性修改（MIA）切除缺陷组件，并结合自动构建检测基的技术。

Result: 数值模拟显示该方法在电路级噪声下表现优异，达到当前最佳性能。

Conclusion: MIA方案和自动检测基技术可广泛应用于测量和CNOT电路，为量子纠错提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The physical implementation of a large-scale error-corrected quantum
processor will necessarily need to mitigate the presence of defective (thereby
"dead") physical components in its operation, for example, identified during
bring-up of the device or detected in the middle of a computation. In the
context of solid-state qubits, the quantum error correcting protocol operating
in the presence of dead components should ideally (i) use the same native
operation set as that without dead components, (ii) maximize salvaging of
functional components, and (iii) use a consistent global operating schedule
which optimizes logical qubit performance and is compatible with the control
requirements of the system. The scheme proposed by Grans-Samuelsson et al.
[Quantum 8, 1429 (2024)] satisfies all three of these criteria: it effectively
excises (cuts out) dead components from the surface code using minimally
invasive alterations (MIA). We conduct extensive numerical simulations of this
proposal for the pairwise-measurement-based surface code protocol in the
presence of dead components under circuit-level noise. To that end, we also
describe techniques to automatically construct performant check (detector)
bases directly from circuits without manual circuit annotation, which may be of
independent interest. Both the MIA scheme and this automated check basis
computation can be readily used with measurement-based as well as CNOT-based
circuits, and the results presented here demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance.

Result: 展示了逻辑操作可通过量子位置换实现，且具有容错特性，如有效距离保持。

Conclusion: 研究为超越拓扑代码的实用容错量子计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: The homological product is a general-purpose recipe that forges new quantum
codes from arbitrary classical or quantum input codes, often providing enhanced
error-correcting properties. When the input codes are classical linear codes,
it is also known as the hypergraph product. We investigate structured
homological product codes that admit logical operations arising from
permutation symmetries in their input codes. We present a broad theoretical
framework that characterizes the logical operations resulting from these
underlying automorphisms. In general, these logical operations can be performed
by a combination of physical qubit permutations and a subsystem circuit. In
special cases related to symmetries of the input Tanner graphs, logical
operations can be performed solely through qubit permutations. We further
demonstrate that these "automorphism gadgets" can possess inherent
fault-tolerant properties such as effective distance preservation, assuming
physical permutations are free. Finally, we survey the literature of classical
linear codes with rich automorphism structures and show how various classical
code families fit into our framework. Complementary to other fault-tolerant
gadgets for homological product codes, our results further advance the search
for practical fault tolerance beyond topological codes in platforms capable of
long-range connectivity.

Abstract: We investigate a bosonic variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model coupled
to a Lindbladian environment, focusing on the interplay between quantum
many-body dynamics and dissipation. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral
formalism in the large-N limit, we uncover a rich phase structure, including
symmetry breaking and phase transitions. Our results suggest that the
dissipation can partially tame the instability of the inverted potential,
leading to novel steady-state phases. We also identify regimes with multiple
competing saddle points and discuss potential implications for the landscape of
metastable states.

Motivation: 研究非厄米系统中的量子计量学，探索PT对称性和非厄米趋肤效应对量子传感的影响。

Method: 采用双正交量子Fisher信息分析，结合多参数估计方法，通过理论推导和有限尺寸计算验证结果。

Result: 发现非厄米趋肤效应相中敏感性指数抑制（F_Q ∝ N^3 e^{-2κN}），而PT破缺异常点附近可实现Heisenberg标度的增强（F_Q ∝ N^2/δ）。多参数估计的量子Fisher信息矩阵标度为N^2，超越标准量子极限。

Conclusion: 非厄米量子计量学中存在核心二分性：非厄米趋肤效应抑制敏感性，而PT对称性可实现Heisenberg极限增强，这源于不同的谱和局域化拓扑结构。

Abstract: We outline a theoretical framework for quantum metrology in non-Hermitian
systems, demonstrating both significant failure and exceptional regimes in
PT-symmetric Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer chains. Through biorthogonal quantum
Fisher information analysis, we identify two distinct regimes: exponential
sensitivity suppression in the non-Hermitian skin effect phase ($F_Q \propto
N^3 e^{-2\kappa N}$) where eigenstates localize exponentially, and quadratic
enhancement near PT-breaking exceptional points [1-4] ($F_Q \propto
N^2/\delta$) achieving Heisenberg scaling. Our multiparameter analysis
establishes optimal simultaneous estimation of chemical potential, Peierls
phase, and gain/loss strength with quantum Fisher information matrix scaling as
$N^2$, surpassing the standard quantum limit by factors exceeding $10^2$. For
realistic parameters ($t/2\pi=10$ MHz, $\Delta/2\pi=1$ MHz, $N=50$), we predict
enhancement factors $\eta_\mu \approx 20\sqrt{N}=141$ for chemical potential
estimation and $\eta_\phi \approx t^2 \sqrt{3N/2}=100\sqrt{N}$ over classical
sensing. These results are validated through exact finite-size calculations and
provide concrete protocols for superconducting circuit implementations.We
reveal a core dichotomy in non-Hermitian quantum metrology: NHSE suppresses
sensitivity exponentially, while $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry enables
Heisenberg-limited enhancement -- each arising from distinct spectral and
localization topologies.

Result: 成功构建了混合稳定子态和纠错码，展示了其非高斯-克利福德操作生成的纠缠特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为混合量子系统提供了新的稳定子态和纠错码，扩展了量子信息处理的能力。

Abstract: We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of
discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework
absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space
parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator.
The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension,
yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of
non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be
obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
(GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits
of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit
entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford)
operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of
oscillator and qudit stabilizer states. We construct general hybrid
error-correcting codes by relating stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori and
obtaining logical operators via Morita equivalence. We provide examples using
commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger equation with Dunkl derivative for
a free particle confined in a cylindrical potential well. We consider both the
finite and infinite height cases. The Dunkl formalism introduces reflection
operators that modify the structure of the Hamiltonian and affect the parity of
the solutions. By working in cylindrical coordinates, we obtain exact
analytical expressions for the radial and axial wavefunctions in terms of
Bessel functions. The energy spectrum and the solutions are classified
according to the eigenvalues of the reflection operators in the three
coordinates. We analyze in detail the conditions under which the wavefunctions
acquire definite parity and discuss the resulting constraints on the Dunkl
parameters.

TL;DR: TUSQ是一种用于模拟噪声量子电路的仿真器，通过减少冗余电路执行和重用计算，显著提高了模拟速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于量子硬件访问受限，需要开发准确且可扩展的噪声量子电路模拟器。

Method: TUSQ使用错误表征模块（ECM）减少冗余电路执行，并通过树形执行模块（TEM）重用计算，利用深度优先搜索和反计算优化模拟时间。

Result: 在186个基准测试中，TUSQ平均比Qiskit和CUDA-Q快52.5倍和12.53倍，最高可达7878.03倍和439.38倍。

Conclusion: TUSQ通过高效减少冗余和计算重用，显著提升了噪声量子电路的模拟速度。

Abstract: Quantum computers have grown in size and qubit quality in recent years,
enabling the execution of complex quantum circuits. However, for most
researchers, access to compute time on quantum hardware is limited. This
necessitates the need to build simulators that mimic the execution of quantum
circuits on noisy quantum hardware accurately and scalably.
  In this work, we propose TUSQ - Tracking, Uncomputation, and Sampling for
Noisy Quantum Simulation. To represent the stochastic noisy channels
accurately, we average the output of multiple quantum circuits with fixed noisy
gates sampled from the channels. However, this leads to a substantial increase
in circuit overhead, which slows down the simulation. To eliminate this
overhead, TUSQ uses two modules: the Error Characterization Module (ECM), and
the Tree-based Execution Module (TEM).
  The ECM tracks the number of unique circuit executions needed to accurately
represent the noise. That is, if initially we needed $n_{1}$ circuit
executions, ECM reduces that number to $n_{2}$ by eliminating redundancies so
that $n_{2} < n_{1}$. This is followed by the TEM, which reuses computation
across these $n_{2}$ circuits. This computational reuse is facilitated by
representing all $n_{2}$ circuits as a tree. We sample the significant leaf
nodes of this tree and prune the remaining ones. We traverse this tree using
depth-first search. We use uncomputation to perform rollback-recovery at
several stages which reduces simulation time. We evaluate TUSQ for a total of
186 benchmarks and report an average speedup of $52.5\times$ and $12.53\times$
over Qiskit and CUDA-Q, which goes up to $7878.03\times$ and $439.38\times$
respectively. For larger benchmarks (more than than 15 qubits), the average
speedup is $55.42\times$ and $23.03\times$ over Qiskit and CUDA-Q respectively

Conclusion: 提供了一种灵活的替代方案，适用于部分可调系统-浴耦合的量子计算系统。

Abstract: We propose a universal gate set for quantum computing that operates in the
presence of decoherence without requiring the overhead of quantum error
correction. Inspired by recent advances in noise manipulation technologies, we
demonstrate that a broad class of anisotropic qubit-bath couplings can be
decoupled via a dressing transformation, which generates a system-bath
entangled resource basis. When initialized in this basis, the computation
evolves as if decoherence is absent. Our proposal offers a flexible alternative
to systems requiring quantum error correction by utilizing partially tunable
system-bath couplings.

Result: 证明隐形传态能将相干误差转化为泡利误差，从而支持高效经典模拟和理论阈值证明。

Conclusion: 隐形传态的内在噪声调节特性可能消除随机编译的需求，为量子计算提供新思路。

Abstract: Compared to the more widely studied Pauli errors, coherent errors present
several new challenges in quantum computing and quantum error correction (QEC).
For example, coherent errors may interfere constructively over a long circuit
and significantly increase the overall failure rate compared to Pauli noise.
Additionally, there is so far no analytical proof for a topological code
threshold under coherent errors. Moreover, it is hard to even numerically
estimate the performance of QEC under coherent errors as their effect in a
Clifford circuit cannot be efficiently classically simulated. In this work, we
demonstrate that teleportation effectively tailors coherent errors into Pauli
errors, for which analytical and numerical results are abundant. We first show
that repeated teleportation of a single qubit decoheres errors, and the average
infidelity grows at worst linearly with the number of teleportations, similar
to Pauli errors. We then analyze a physically motivated pure $Z$-coherent error
model for teleported CSS codes in which over-rotation errors accompany every
gate, and find that such an error model is equivalent to a Pauli error model.
Our result implies that the performance of a CSS code implemented via
teleportation-based error correction or measurement-based error correction with
such coherent noise can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer and
has an analytically provable threshold. The intrinsic noise-tailoring property
of teleportation may ultimately remove the need for randomized compiling in
teleportation-based quantum computing schemes.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of quantum information technology, quantum
networks have become essential for supporting diverse applications, which often
have stringent demands for key metrics such as fidelity and request completion
time. In this work, we propose a design for early-stage quantum networks that
is compatible with the three existing quantum repeater technologies. The design
aims to maximize the ability of the network to accommodate the diverse needs of
quantum applications, even under conditions of limited quantum resources and
suboptimal network performance. We have also described the required identifiers
in the quantum network and the specific process for implementing quantum
requests. To assess the feasibility of our design, we conduct simulations based
on discrete-event modeling of quantum networks. The simulations consider
various types of noise and imperfect parameters that might exist in early-stage
networks. We analyze the impact of these parameters on the fidelity of the
generated entangled states and the request completion time. Furthermore, we
investigated additional decisions that the central controller can make beyond
path selection, such as the choice of cutoff time and the allocation of network
resources to requests.

TL;DR: HyperBlossom是一个统一的量子纠错解码框架，通过将MLE解码转化为MWPF问题，并扩展blossom算法到超图，显著提升了解码效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速准确的量子纠错解码对可扩展的容错量子计算至关重要，但现有的MLE解码方法在通用qLDPC码上难以实现，通常依赖近似和启发式方法。

Method: 提出HyperBlossom框架，将MLE解码建模为MWPF问题，并通过超图上的blossom算法实现，结合了启发式和认证解码器的优势。

Result: HyperBlossom在表面码和双变量自行车码上分别实现了4.8倍和1.6倍的逻辑错误率降低，且运行时间几乎线性扩展。

Conclusion: HyperBlossom为量子纠错解码提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，统一了现有解码方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Fast and accurate quantum error correction (QEC) decoding is crucial for
scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation. Most-Likely-Error (MLE) decoding,
while being near-optimal, is intractable on general quantum Low-Density
Parity-Check (qLDPC) codes and typically relies on approximation and
heuristics. We propose HyperBlossom, a unified framework that formulates MLE
decoding as a Minimum-Weight Parity Factor (MWPF) problem and generalizes the
blossom algorithm to hypergraphs via a similar primal-dual linear programming
model with certifiable proximity bounds. HyperBlossom unifies all the existing
graph-based decoders like (Hypergraph) Union-Find decoders and Minimum-Weight
Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder, thus bridging the gap between heuristic and
certifying decoders.
  We implement HyperBlossom in software, namely Hyperion. Hyperion achieves a
4.8x lower logical error rate compared to the MWPM decoder on the distance-11
surface code and 1.6x lower logical error rate compared to a fine-tuned BPOSD
decoder on the $[[90, 8, 10]]$ bivariate bicycle code under code-capacity
noise. It also achieves an almost-linear average runtime scaling on both the
surface code and the color code, with numerical results up to sufficiently
large code distances of 99 and 31 for code-capacity noise and circuit-level
noise, respectively.

Result: QFOR在相对保真度性能上比启发式基线提高了29.5-84%，同时保持可比的量子执行时间。

Conclusion: QFOR是一种自适应且高效的量子任务编排框架，有助于量子计算资源的成本效益利用。

Abstract: Quantum cloud computing enables remote access to quantum processors, yet the
heterogeneity and noise of available quantum hardware create significant
challenges for efficient resource orchestration. These issues complicate the
optimization of quantum task allocation and scheduling, as existing heuristic
methods fall short in adapting to dynamic conditions or effectively balancing
execution fidelity and time. Here, we propose QFOR, a Quantum Fidelity-aware
Orchestration of tasks across heterogeneous quantum nodes in cloud-based
environments using Deep Reinforcement learning. We model the quantum task
orchestration as a Markov Decision Process and employ the Proximal Policy
Optimization algorithm to learn adaptive scheduling policies, using IBM quantum
processor calibration data for noise-aware performance estimation. Our
configurable framework balances overall quantum task execution fidelity and
time, enabling adaptation to different operational priorities. Extensive
evaluation demonstrates that QFOR is adaptive and achieves significant
performance with 29.5-84% improvements in relative fidelity performance over
heuristic baselines. Furthermore, it maintains comparable quantum execution
times, contributing to cost-efficient use of quantum computation resources.

Abstract: We study the entanglement indices such as logarithmic negativities (LNs) and
mutual informations (MIs) between two adjacent subsets in a isolated universal
set $U$ of harmonic oscillators arranged on a two dimensional lattice within a
sufficiently large square. First, we verify the values of the corner functions
of angle $\pi/2, \pi/4, 3\pi/4$ presented in the previous study which adopts
periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) for the $U$. The values of each corner
function obtained from LNs are nearly equal to those in the previous ones,
while those of $3\pi/4$ from MIs are not sufficiently consistent with those
computed from LNs. Next, for the case where the universal system $U$ satisfies
the fixed end boundary conditions(FBCs), we calculate LNs, MIs at several
locations in $U$, compare them, especially corner functions with the values
obtained in the PBCs case, and examine the effect of the fixed ends. In
addition, we examine Renyi entropies for sets of three dimensional lattice
sites, the corner functions and the edge terms with solid angles and dihedral
angles $\pi/2,\pi/4$, respectively.

Motivation: 在金融和能源系统等数据敏感领域，差分隐私（DP）虽能保护数据隐私，但传统方法（如DP-SGD）会因噪声注入损害模型性能。

Method: Q-DPTS结合变分量子电路（VQCs）、逐样本梯度裁剪和高斯噪声注入，实现严格的差分隐私保证。

Result: 在ETT数据集上，Q-DPTS在相同隐私预算下比经典和量子基线（如LSTM、QASA等）预测误差更低。

Conclusion: Q-DPTS为隐私关键场景下的时间序列建模提供了安全且准确的解决方案，是量子增强差分隐私预测的早期探索。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is vital in domains where data sensitivity is
paramount, such as finance and energy systems. While Differential Privacy (DP)
provides theoretical guarantees to protect individual data contributions, its
integration especially via DP-SGD often impairs model performance due to
injected noise. In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical
framework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS
combines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping
and Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables
improved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We
evaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a
standard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is
compared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,
QRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower
prediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable
privacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations
into quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising
directions for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical
scenarios.

Abstract: We consider multi-party quantum sequence discrimination under local
operations and classical communication(LOCC), and provide conditions under
which the optimal LOCC discrimination of a multi-party quantum sequence
ensemble can be factorized into that of each individual ensemble. In other
words, the optimal LOCC discrimination of a multi-party quantum sequence
ensemble can be achieved just by performing optimal LOCC discrimination
independently at each step of the quantum sequence. We also illustrate through
examples of multi-party quantum states that such factorizability of optimal
LOCC discrimination is possible. We further establish a necessary and
sufficient condition under which the optimal LOCC discrimination of a
multi-party quantum state ensemble can be realized just by guessing the state
with the largest probability. Our results can provide a useful application to

Abstract: Accurate measurements of alternating current (AC) and direct current(DC)
ratios are fundamental to electric power metrology. However, conventional
current comparators for AC and DC typically rely on distinct
technologies-electromagnetic induction for AC and superconducting quantum
interference devices for DC. This technological divide leads to a fragmented
and complex traceability system. Bridging this gap is critical for developing
unified current standards that meet the demands of emerging power technologies.
In this work, we present a compact, room-temperature AC/DC current comparator
that integrates a diamond-based magnetometer using nitrogen-vacancy centers.
The device achieves an accuracy of 10-8 for both AC and DC signals and supports
a system bandwidth up to 300 Hz, without the need for cryogenics. It surpasses
the performance of typical AC comparators, offering ten-fold higher accuracy,
and matches that of state-of-the-art DC comparators. This unified,
cryogenics-free solution not only enhances precision and versatility but also
expands the applicability of the system to DC resistance bridges in quantum
electrical standards.

observe promising performance in regressing discrete variables. While
hyperparameter selection remains a challenge, requiring careful optimisation to
unlock the full potential of these models, this work contributes significantly
to the development of QML for solving intricate problems in aeroelasticity. We
present an end-to-end trainable hybrid algorithm. We first encode time series
into tensor networks to then utilise trainable tensor networks for
dimensionality reduction, and convert the resulting tensor to a quantum circuit
in the encoding step. Then, a tensor network inspired trainable variational
quantum circuit is applied to solve either a classification or a multivariate

Abstract: Satellite Quantum Key Distribution creates a pathway for secure global
communication with a level of security that is peerless. However,
ground-to-satellite Quantum Key Distribution links are degraded due to the
atmospheric turbulence. This paper gives a numerical framework using angular
spectrum propagation, Hufnagel-Valley model of turbulence and Von Karman phase
screens and takes into account the static losses introduced due to the
absorption of the beam by the different elements and compounds in the
atmosphere like O2, CO2 and H2O. This simulation propagates a Gaussian beam
step by step through the atmosphere, where we incorporate the phase distortions
using phase screens based on standard Cn2 profiles which take into account
losses such as scintillation and beam wander. We simulate the BB84 protocol
with decoy states for added security. The results of the simulation quantify
the expected link budget and Secure key rates over a range of distances to
measure the viability of Free Space Optical Quantum Key Distribution links at
different distances.

Abstract: Quantum networks will rely on photons entangled to robust, local quantum
registers for computation and error correction. We demonstrate control of and
entanglement in a fully connected three-qubit $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ nuclear spin
register in diamond. The register is coupled to a quasi-free electron spin-1/2
of a silicon-vacancy center (SiV). High strain decouples the SiVs electron spin
from spin-orbit interaction reducing the susceptibility to phonons at liquid
helium temperature. As a result, the electron spin lifetime of hundreds of
milli seconds enables sensing of nuclear-nuclear couplings down to few hertz.
To detect and control the register we leverage continuous decoupling using
shaped, low-power microwave and direct radio frequency driving. Furthermore, we
implement a nuclear spin conditional phase-gate on the electron spin to mediate
bipartite entanglement. This approach presents an alternative to dynamically
decoupled nuclear spin entanglement, not limited by the electron spin's 1/2
nature, opening up new avenues to an optically-accessible, solid-state quantum
register.

Conclusion: 诱导相干方案在集成系统中表现更优，为OCT传感器的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: The development of practical sensors for optical coherence tomography (OCT)
with undetected photons requires miniaturization via integration. To be
practical, these sensors must exhibit a large spectral bandwidth and a high
brightness, which are linked to a high axial resolution and a sufficient signal
to noise ratio, respectively. Here, we combine these requirements in a scheme
for OCT-measurements with undetected photons based on nonlinear Ti:LiNbO$_3$
waveguides. We investigate the performance benchmarks of the commonly used
SU(1,1) scheme in comparison to an induced coherence scheme and find that the
latter is actually better suited when implementing measurements with undetected
photons in integrated systems. In both schemes, we perform pump gain
optimization and OCT measurements with undetected photons with an axial
resolution as low as 28 $\mathrm{\mu}$m.

Abstract: One of the most crucial steps in creating practical quantum computers is
designing scalable and efficient superconducting qubits. Coherence times,
connections between individual qubits, and reduction of environmental noise are
critical factors in the success of these qubits. Because they can be
lithographically fabricated and are less sensitive to charge noise,
superconducting qubits, especially those based on the Transmon architecture,
have emerged as top contenders for scalable platforms. In this work, we use a
combination of design iteration, material analysis, and simulation to tackle
the superconducting qubit optimization challenge. We created transmon-based
layouts for 4 qubits and 8 qubits using Qiskit Metal and conducted an
individual analysis for each qubit. We investigated anharmonicity and extracted
eigenfrequencies, computing participation ratios across several design passes,
and identifying the top five energy eigenstates using Ansys HFSS. We then
created a 2D cross section of a single qubit design in COMSOL Multiphysics to
evaluate how different materials affect performance. This enables us to assign
various superconducting materials and substrates and investigate their effects
on energy loss and electromagnetic properties. Qubit coherence and overall
device quality are significantly influenced by the materials chosen. This
integrated framework of material based simulation and circuit design offers a
workable way to create reliable superconducting qubit systems and supports
continued attempts to create scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Method: 采用三阶段方法：对称性保持的基态扰动、测量特定卷积和可观测量的最终解卷积，后两阶段使用Hopf纤维化将量子可观测量映射到涡管上。

Result: 使用27个量子比特生成了瞬时湍流场，重现了能量谱、涡旋结构和间歇性，且仅需O(log₂Re)量子比特。

Conclusion: 该方法在湍流场编码中实现了渐进最优，为多尺度系统的大规模量子模拟提供了可能。

Abstract: The chaotic structure of multiscale systems presents a formidable challenge
to their quantum encoding. We propose a three-stage hyperspherical encoding
method for turbulent fields. This method comprises a symmetry-preserving
perturbation of the ground state, a measurement-specific convolution, and a
final deconvolution of observables. The latter two stages employ the Hopf
fibration to map quantum observables onto vortex tubes, the building blocks of
fluid turbulence. Using 27 qubits, we generate an instantaneous turbulent field
at a Reynolds number of $\mathit{Re} = 13900$ that reproduces the energy
spectrum with Kolmogorov's five-thirds scaling, tangled vortex structures, and
strong intermittency. The method only requires $\mathcal{O}(\log_2\mathit{Re})$
qubits, which is asymptotically optimal for turbulent-field encoding. This
yields an exponential memory reduction over classical methods, and enables
state preparation for large-scale quantum simulation of multiscale systems.

Abstract: Digital signatures represent a crucial cryptographic asset that must be
protected against quantum adversaries. Quantum Digital Signatures (QDS) can
offer solutions that are information-theoretically (IT) secure and thus immune
to quantum attacks. In this work, we analyze three existing practical QDS
protocols based on preshared secure keys (e.g., established with quantum key
distribution) and universal hashing families. For each protocol, we make
amendments to close potential loopholes and prove their IT security while
accounting for the failure of IT-secure authenticated communication. We then
numerically optimize the protocol parameters to improve efficiency in terms of
preshared bit consumption and signature length, allowing us to identify the
most efficient protocol.

Abstract: Preparing a quantum circuit that implements a given sparse state is an
important building block that is necessary for many different quantum
algorithms. In the context of fault-tolerant quantum computing, the so-called
non-Clifford gates are much more expensive to perform than the Clifford ones.
We hence provide an algorithm for synthesizing sparse quantum states with a
special care for quantum resources. The circuit depth, ancilla count, and
crucially non-Clifford count of the circuit produced by the algorithm are all
linear in the sparsity. We conjecture that the non-Clifford count complexity is
tight, and show a weakened version of this claim. The first key component of
the algorithm is the synthesis of a generalized W-state. We provide a
tree-based circuit construction approach, and the relationship between the
tree's structure and the circuit's complexity. The second key component is a
classical reversible circuit implementing a permutation that maps the basis
states of the W-state to those of the sparse quantum state. We reduce this
problem to the diagonalization of a binary matrix, using a specific set of
elementary matrix operations corresponding to the classical reversible gates.
We then solve this problem using a new version of Gauss-Jordan elimination,
that minimizes the circuit complexities including circuit depth using parallel
elimination steps.

Abstract: The ability to prepare states for quantum chemistry is a promising feature of
quantum computers, and efficient techniques for chemical state preparation is
an active area of research. In this paper, we implement and investigate two
methods of quantum circuit preparation for multiconfigurational states for
quantum chemical applications. It has previously been shown that controlled
Givens rotations are universal for quantum chemistry. To prepare a selected
linear combination of Slater determinants (represented as occupation number
configurations) using Givens rotations, the gates that rotate between the
reference and excited determinants need to be controlled on qubits outside the
excitation (external controls), in general. We implement a method to
automatically find the external controls required for utilizing Givens
rotations to prepare multiconfigurational states on a quantum circuit. We
compare this approach to an alternative technique that exploits the sparsity of
the chemical state vector and find that the latter can outperform the method of
externally controlled Givens rotations; highly reduced circuits can be obtained
by taking advantage of the sparse nature (where the number of basis states is
significantly less than 2$^{n_q}$ for $n_q$ qubits) of chemical wavefunctions.
We demonstrate the benefits of these techniques in a range of applications,
including the ground states of a strongly correlated molecule, matrix elements
of the Q-SCEOM algorithm for excited states, as well as correlated initial
states for a quantum subspace method based on quantum computed moments and
quantum phase estimation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) exhibit broad utility but face limitations in
quantum sensor development, stemming from interdisciplinary knowledge barriers
and involving complex optimization processes. Here we present QCopilot, an
LLM-based multi-agent framework integrating external knowledge access, active
learning, and uncertainty quantification for quantum sensor design and
diagnosis. Comprising commercial LLMs with few-shot prompt engineering and
vector knowledge base, QCopilot employs specialized agents to adaptively select
optimization methods, automate modeling analysis, and independently perform
problem diagnosis. Applying QCopilot to atom cooling experiments, we generated
10${}^{\rm{8}}$ sub-$\rm{\mu}$K atoms without any human intervention within a
few hours, representing $\sim$100$\times$ speedup over manual experimentation.
Notably, by continuously accumulating prior knowledge and enabling dynamic
modeling, QCopilot can autonomously identify anomalous parameters in
multi-parameter experimental settings. Our work reduces barriers to large-scale
quantum sensor deployment and readily extends to other quantum information
systems.

Conclusion: 区域局域纠缠的上下界揭示了不同量子态的结构性纠缠特性差异。

Abstract: In quantum networks, eliminating connections between nodes is crucial to
mitigate the effects of decoherence, often achieved by performing measurements
on nodes that are idle, or vulnerable to noise. To characterize the
entanglement content of the resulting smaller network, we introduce the notion
of ``regionally localized entanglement", defined as the average entanglement
concentrated over a two-qubit region in a multi-qubit system. Hence, the total
regionally localized entanglement can be obtained by considering all two-qubit
regions sharing a common qubit, referred to as the ``hub". We prove that the
total regionally localized entanglement corresponding to a specific hub is
bounded above and below via the localizable block entanglement shared between
the hub and the rest of the multi-qubit system for a number of paradigmatic
pure quantum states, including permutation-symmetric states and arbitrary
superposition of states from a specific magnetization sector. Numerical
simulations confirm that the bounds for permutation-symmetric pure states
remain valid even for Haar-uniformly generated pure states, and when each of
the qubits is sent through local phase-flip channels of Markovian and
non-Markovian types, except when the system-size is small. On the other hand,
arbitrary states from a particular magnetization sector yield bounds on total
regionally localized entanglement that are distinct from the
permutation-symmetric states, highlighting the structurally unique entanglement
properties of the former.

Conclusion: 该框架高效且通用，适用于多种受限操作下的资源认证。

Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement (HDE) is a valuable resource in quantum
information processing, and efficient certification of HDE is crucial to many
applications. In this work, we propose a simple and general framework for
certifying HDE in general bipartite pure states under restricted operations,
such as local operations and classical communication (LOCC). On this basis we
show that HDE in general bipartite pure states can be certified efficiently.
Moreover, the sample cost for certifying a given degree of HDE even decreases
monotonically with the local dimensions. In addition, for a general two-qubit
pure state, we construct an optimal entanglement certification strategy based
on separable operations, which can be realized by LOCC when the target state
has sufficiently high entanglement. The core concept of our framework is
versatile and can be extended to certify a wide range of critical resources
under restricted operations.

Abstract: Typical multiparty semi-quantum secret sharing (MSQSS) protocols require the
dealer to possess full quantum capabilities, while the classical users usually
need to perform three operations. To address this practical limitation, this
paper introduces a new mediated MSQSS protocol that enables Alice, a classical
user, to share a secret with $M$ classical Bobs, with the assistance of an
untrusted third party (TP) who may attempt any possible attack to steal Alice's
secret. Furthermore, the classical participants require only two capabilities
instead of three, namely: (a) performing measurements in the $Z$ basis; and (b)
reordering qubits. The proposed scheme offers significant advantages over
existing mediated QSS protocols: (1) it is the first mediated SQSS protocol to
adopt single qubits, instead of entangled states, as the quantum resource,
which makes it more practical and easier to implement; (2) It achieves higher
qubit efficiency. Security analysis also demonstrates that the protocol is
secure against well-known attacks.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the single-photon scattering spectrum of a driven
$\Lambda$-type giant atom system chirally coupled to a one-dimensional (1D)
waveguide. By employing a real-space scattering approach, we obtain analytical
solutions for the scattering amplitudes that remain valid in both Markovian and
non-Markovian regimes. We observe that an external driving field induces a
splitting of the transmission spectrum's dip into double dips, with the
distance between the two dips increasing as the strength of the driving field
increases. The chiral nature of the coupling allows for controlled switching
between complete transmission and perfect reflection of incident photons. In
the Markovian limit, we predict robust perfect transmission at specific phase
values, independent of the driving field parameters.Moreover, in the
non-Markovian regime, as the size of the giant atom increases, the oscillatory
behavior of the scattering spectrum becomes more pronounced. Adjusting the
giant atom size enables control over the number of decoupling points as well as
the number of complete reflection points.

Abstract: As fault-tolerant quantum computers scale, certifying the accuracy of
computations performed with encoded logical qubits will soon become classically
intractable. This creates a critical need for scalable, device-independent
certification methods. In this work, we introduce logical accreditation, a
framework for efficiently certifying quantum computations performed on logical
qubits. Our protocol is robust against general noise models, far beyond those
typically considered in performance analyses of quantum error-correcting codes.
Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that logical accreditation can
scalably certify quantum advantage experiments and indicate the crossover point
where encoded computations begin to outperform physical computations. Logical
accreditation can also find application in evaluating whether logical circuit
error rates are sufficiently low that error mitigation can be efficiently
performed, extending the entropy benchmarking method to the regime of
fault-tolerant computation, and upper-bounding the infidelity of the logical
output state. Underpinning the framework is a novel randomised compiling scheme
that converts arbitrary logical circuit noise into stochastic Pauli noise. This
scheme includes a method for twirling non-transversal logical gates beyond the
standard T-gate, resolving an open problem posed by Piveteau et al. [Piveteau
et al. PRL 127, 200505 (2001)]. By bridging fault-tolerant computation and
computational certification, logical accreditation offers a practical tool to
assess the quality of computations performed on quantum hardware using encoded
logical qubits.

Abstract: High-quality quantum state generation is essential for advanced quantum
information processing, including quantum communication, quantum sensing, and
quantum computing. In practice, various error sources degrade the quality of
quantum states, and quantum state tomography (QST) is a standard diagnostic
tool. However, in QST, multiple error sources gather in a single density
matrix, making it difficult to identify individual error sources. To address
this problem, we propose an automated method for quantifying error sources by
combining simulation and parameter optimization to reproduce the experimental
density matrix. We focus on the experimental generation of time-bin entangled
photon pairs, for which we model the relevant error sources and simulate the
density matrix with adjustable model parameters, thereby optimizing the
parameters and minimizing the trace distance to the experimental data.
Optimization of the parameters reduced the trace distance from 0.177 to 0.024,
indicating that our modeled error sources explain 86% of the errors. Reducing
the predicted error sources improves the state quality, consistent with our
predictions and thus validating the proposed method. In addition, the modular
structure of this framework makes it applicable to other quantum platforms,
such as superconducting qubits, atoms, and solid-state spins.

loss in symbol efficiency. Moreover, the separation between the estimation and
reconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we
propose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter
estimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework. By
leveraging the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the proposed method
simultaneously estimates unknown parameters during decoding, eliminating the
need for separate ML estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid
multidimensional rotation scheme that removes the requirement for norm
feedback, significantly reducing classical channel overhead. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to unify multidimensional reconciliation and
channel parameter estimation in CV-QKD, providing a practical solution for
high-efficiency reconciliation with minimal pilots.

Conclusion: 研究为设计实用的脉冲QML模型提供了理论基础，平衡了表达性和可训练性。

Abstract: Pulse-based Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged as a novel paradigm in
quantum artificial intelligence due to its exceptional hardware efficiency. For
practical applications, pulse-based models must be both expressive and
trainable. Previous studies suggest that pulse-based models under dynamic
symmetry can be effectively trained, thanks to a favorable loss landscape that
has no barren plateaus. However, the resulting uncontrollability may compromise
expressivity when the model is inadequately designed. This paper investigates
the requirements for pulse-based QML models to be expressive while preserving
trainability. We present a necessary condition pertaining to the system's
initial state, the measurement observable, and the underlying dynamical
symmetry Lie algebra, supported by numerical simulations. Our findings
establish a framework for designing practical pulse-based QML models that
balance expressivity and trainability.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an emerging cryptographic method designed
for secure key sharing. Its security is theoretically guaranteed by fundamental
principles of quantum mechanics, making it a leading candidate for future
communication protocols. Quantum Random Walks (QRWs), on the other hand, are
quantum processes that exhibit intriguing phenomena such as interference and
superposition, enabling the generation of decentralized and asymmetric
probability distributions. Inspired by both fields of study, we propose a novel
QKD protocol based on two entangled quantum walkers. Our protocol exploits the
unique correlations between the walkers at extremal positions of the walk to
establish secret keys shared exclusively by the two parties. The security of
the protocol is augmented by analyzing the joint probability distributions of
the walkers' measured positions and their associated coin states.

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了基础理解，还为低损耗热电器件设计指明了方向。

Abstract: Organic semiconductors show complex phenomena due to their high energetic
disorder. A striking example is the possibility of an increased effective
temperature T_eff of the charge carrier distribution relative to the lattice
temperature, which results from the slow charge carrier relaxation after
excitation, either by high electric field or photon absorption. The increased
effective temperature has been linked to conductivity enhancements and
performance increases in actual devices, but a direct observation has been
lacking. Here, we utilize nanoscopic tree-terminal devices to measure the
Seebeck voltage arising in a doped organic polymer semiconductor due to a
field-driven enhancement of the effective electronic temperature, providing
direct proof of the existence of T_eff. The results agree quantitatively with
numerical predictions by a kinetic Monte Carlo model. The findings not only
provide fundamental understanding but also indicate an avenue towards low-loss
thermoelectric devices.

Conclusion: 无序在Rydberg系统中引发新现象，需谨慎处理量子模拟器中的无序效应。

Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays promise high-fidelity quantum simulations of critical
phenomena with flexible geometries. Yet experimental realizations inevitably
suffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to
departures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional
disorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an
infinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical
features in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder
in Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the
physics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially
short-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new
classes of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would
destroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a
novel pseudo-criticality emerges in mesoscopic Rydberg chains, and show that
the renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation. Our findings uncover new disorder-driven
phenomena and underscore the importance of carefully treating disorder effects
in quantum simulators.

Abstract: Cold atom systems in optical lattices have long been recognized as an ideal
platform for bridging condense matter physics and quantum optics. Here, we
investigate the 1D fermionic superradiance in an optical lattice, and observe
novel tricritical phenomena and multistability in finite-temperature cases. As
a starting point, which can be analytically calculated, we compare the 1D and
2D Fermi gases in zero-temperature limit. It turns out that the tricritical
point originates from the higher-order Fermi surface nesting (FSN), and the
infrared divergence in 1D systems is absent in 2D cases. When extending to
finite-temperature cases, our numerical results reveal that both quantum- and
classical-type trcritical phenomena can be observed simultaneously. Moreover,
there exists an optimal temperature for observing superradiance. This work
provides a new approach to understanding the relation between quantum and
classical phase transitions.

Abstract: The relationship between unstable fixed points and chaotic dynamics in
high-dimensional neural dynamics remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
the kinetic energy distribution of random recurrent neural networks by
combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We
find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a
positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain), with a
power-law behavior close to the critical point. The steady-state activity
distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations
on finite-size systems. This study provides a first step toward understanding
the landscape of kinetic energy, which may reflect the structure of phase space
for the non-equilibrium dynamics.

Result: 发现位移平方与时间的关系为t^(5/2)，揭示了不可压缩流体的有色噪声效应。

Conclusion: 这一结果为非平衡流体动力学的研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Brownian motion is a foundational problem in physics and is characterized by
a mean squared displacement that scales linearly in time in thermal
equilibrium, known as diffusion. At short times, the mean squared displacement
becomes ballistic, scaling as t^2. This effect was predicted by Einstein in
1907 and recently observed experimentally. We report that this picture is only
true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict
theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement
becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of t^(5/2). This new result
is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a non-zero
first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on non-zero initial
velocities. These results are a first step towards the unraveling of
nonequilibrium dynamics of fluids.

Conclusion: 熵产生率可作为非互易活性系统中集体行为和相变的量化指标。

Abstract: The out-of-equilibrium character of active systems is often twofold, arising
from both the activity itself and from non-reciprocal couplings between
constituents. A well-established measure to quantify the system's distance from
equilibrium is the informatic entropy production rate. Here, we ask the
question whether and how the informatic entropy production rate reflects
collective behaviors and transitions in an active mixture with non-reciprocal
polar couplings. In such systems, non-reciprocal orientational couplings can
induce chiral motion of particles. At the field-theoretical level, transitions
to these time-dependent chiral states are marked by so-called exceptional
points. Here, we show that at a particle level, the entropy production rate
within the chiral states increases with the degree of non-reciprocity, provided
it is sufficiently strong. Moreover, even at small degrees of non-reciprocity,
the transitions via exceptional points leave clear signatures in the entropy
production rate, which exhibits pronounced peaks at coupling strengths
corresponding to the field-theoretical exceptional points. Overall, the
increase and peaks of the entropy production rate mirror the susceptibility of
the polarization order parameter at the particle level. This correspondence is
supported by a field-theoretical analysis, which reveals that, in the
long-wavelength limit, the entropy production rate scales with the
susceptibilities of the polarization fields.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of simultaneous random walkers with resetting on
networks and derive exact analytical expressions for the mean first-encounter
times of Markovian random walkers. Specifically, we consider two cases for the
simultaneous dynamics of two random walkers on networks: when only one walker
resets to the initial node, and when both walkers return to their initial
positions. In both cases, the encounter times are expressed in terms of the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix of the normal random
walk, providing a spectral interpretation of the impact of resetting. We
validate our approach through examples on rings, Cayley trees, and random
networks generated using the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Watts-Strogatz, and
Barab\'asi-Albert algorithms, where resetting significantly reduces encounter
times. The proposed framework can be extended to other types of random walk
dynamics, transport processes, or multiple-walker scenarios, with potential
applications in human mobility, epidemic spreading, and search strategies in
complex systems.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms involved in the thermomigration of interstitial
hydrogen in metals. Using statistical thermodynamics, we develop a

through validation against published experimental data, our results demonstrate
that an electron-wind effect plays a significant role, particularly for
materials in which the thermomigration direction matches the heat flux. These
findings provide new insights into the factors that affect the localisation of
solutes in metals. Moreover, our results indicate that atomistic models may be
inadequate for detailed thermomigration studies due to the omission of
electronic effects.

Abstract: Stochastic hydrodynamics is a central tool in the study of first order phase
transitions at a fundamental level. Combined with sophisticated free energy
models, e.g. as developed in classical Density Functional Theory, complex
processes such as crystallization can be modeled and information such as free
energy barriers, nucleation pathways and the unstable eigenvector and
eigenvalues determined. The latter are particularly interesting as they play
key roles in defining the natural (unbiased) order parameter and the nucleation
rate respectively. As is often the case, computational realities restrict the
size of system that can be modeled and this makes it difficult to achieve
experimental conditions for which the volume is effectively infinite. In this
paper, the use of open boundary conditions is discussed. By using an open
system, the calculations become much closer to experimental conditions however,
the introduction of open boundary conditions raises a number of questions
concerning the stochastic model such as whether the fluctuation-dissipation
relation is preserved and whether stationary points on the free energy surface
remain stationary points of the dynamics.

Conclusion: 揭示了多体量子混沌与相干动力学结构共存的新机制，为广泛疤痕现象提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Highly frustrated magnets, with their macroscopically-degenerate classical
ground states and massively-entangled quantum spin liquid phases, have been
pivotal to the development of modern condensed matter concepts such as emergent
symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. The effects of
frustration and massive degeneracies at high energy, where the many-body
dynamics becomes chaotic, have hitherto been far less explored. Here, we
identify a high-energy dynamical analog of highly-frustrated magnetism, in the
form of an extensive manifold of classical ''interaction-suppressing''
configurations giving rise to unstable periodic orbits. These are in general
neither protected by symmetry nor integrability, and emerge from a set of
dynamical local constraints that effectively nullify the interactions while
allowing extensively many local degrees of freedom. The proliferation of
unstable periodic orbits corresponds in the quantum case to ''hyperscarring'',
that is, quantum scarring on exponentially many unstable periodic orbits. On
the product states associated to the latter, the amplitudes of the mid-spectrum
thermal eigenstates exhibit a power-law distribution, in stark contrast to the
expected exponential Porter-Thomas distribution that holds for generic product
states. Our results reveal a new constrained dynamical regime where many-body
quantum chaos coexists with structured manifolds of coherent dynamics, and
establishes a mechanism for hitherto elusive extensive scarring.

Abstract: We investigate quasiparticle interference on an altermagnetic Lieb-like
lattice and show how a non-spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy
measurement can yield effectively spin-resolved information. Within a four-site
tight-binding model, which can be tuned between an antiferromagnetic and a
Lieb-type altermagnetic state, we introduce on-site impurities at distinct
sublattice sites and compute the real space local density of states (LDOS) via
a Green's function approach. A Fourier transformation of the impurity-induced
LDOS yields the characteristic $d$-wave spin-split Fermi surface contours of
the altermagnetic phase. Notably, by choosing which sublattice the impurity is
placed upon, we show that the scattering amplitudes effectively encode
spin-dependent contrasts: Impurities on one of the magnetic sublattices
highlights predominantly spin-up contributions along one crystallographic
direction, while impurities on the other one favor the complementary spin-down
channel and orientation.

Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study the dimerized spin-1/2
Heisenberg model on a square lattice, focusing on the paramagnetic dimer phase
and its edge states, and associated surface criticality behavior. The model can
also be viewed as two-dimensional antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled usual
ladders with AF rungs. We demonstrate that the dimer phase of the model,
previously considered topologically trivial, is actually a
quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) Haldane phase belonging to a symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) state. This is established by measuring generalized strange
correlators introduced in this work and further confirmed by showing that the
nontrivial edge state on a zigzag cut in the dimer phase is ferromagnetically
ordered, resulting from effective ferromagnetic interactions between degenerate
spinons generated on each side of the zigzag cut. Furthermore, we show that the
ordered edge state gives rise to an extraordinary surface critical behavior at
the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) bulk critical points of the model, which contradicts
theoretical predictions based on classical-quantum mapping.

Abstract: We investigate the ground state phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the star lattice using infinite projected
entangled pair states (iPEPS) and high-order series expansions. The model
includes two distinct couplings: $J_d$ on the dimer bonds and $J_t$ on the
trimer bonds. While it is established that the system hosts a valence bond
solid (VBS) phase for $J_d \ge J_t$, the ground state phase diagram for $J_d <
J_t$ has remained unsettled. Our iPEPS simulations uncover a first-order phase
transition at $J_d/J_t \approx 0.18$, significantly lower than previously
reported estimates. Beyond this transition, we identify a close competition
between two valence bond crystal (VBC) states: a columnar VBC and a $\sqrt{3}
\times \sqrt{3}$ VBC, with the latter consistently exhibiting lower energy
across all finite bond dimensions. The high-order series expansion supports
this by finding that the $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ VBC state indeed becomes
energetically favorable, but only at sixth order in perturbation theory,
revealing the subtle nature of the competition between candidate states.

Abstract: Magnetic axial and polar (Dirac) nickel multipoles contribute to resonant
x-ray Bragg amplitudes in a symmetry informed analysis of monoclinic
Li2Ni3P4O14 presented for future diffraction experiments. Magnetic long-range
order below a temperature 14.5 K can be viewed as a two-dimensional trimerized
antiferromagnet with Ni ions in two Wyckoff positions in the centrosymmetric
magnetic space group P21/c. It permits the coupling to circular polarization in
the primary x-ray beam, unlike the corresponding diffraction by an
antiferromagnet characterized by anti-inversion and a linear magnetoelectric
effect, e.g., historically significant chromium sesquioxide (Cr2O3) and
Cu2(MoO4)(SeO3) (Lovesey & van der Laan, 2024). The space group is inferred
from neutron Bragg diffraction patterns, without an allowance for permitted
Dirac dipoles (anapoles) and quadrupoles (Chikara et al., 2025).

Abstract: We propose a new tensor network renormalization group (TNR) scheme based on

these two into a new algorithm called thermal tensor network renormalization

Abstract: Higher-spin quantum magnets with competing interactions offer a rich platform
for exploring quantum phases that transcend the paradigms of spin-1/2 systems,
owing to their enlarged local Hilbert spaces and the emergence of multipolar
correlations. We investigate a one-dimensional spin-1 chain where quadrupolar
order is promoted by two distinct mechanisms: conventional bilinear-biquadratic
exchange and bond-directional antiferromagnetic Kitaev frustration. Using
density matrix renormalization group calculations, we determine the complete
ground-state phase diagram and uncover two emergent phases induced by the
Kitaev interaction: a Kitaev nematic phase and a Kitaev-dimer phase. The Kitaev
nematic phase emerges from a fragile biquadratic dimer state via a continuous
quantum phase transition in the Ising universality class. The Kitaev dimer
phase spontaneously breaks a screw symmetry to favor either $x$- or $y$-spin
bonding, forming a gapped state that coexists with a crystalline order of
alternating $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes.

Result: 对偶性决定了QMBS态的稳定性，数值与微扰理论结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 非可逆对偶性不仅是生成新QMBS态的机制，也是其稳定性的诊断工具。

Abstract: Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained
renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with
a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that
this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a
nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding
conditions for scarring. This is supported by striking agreement between
first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics
despite chaotic spectra. Our results suggest that non-invertible dualities
provide both a generative mechanism for new QMBS and a diagnostic for their
stability.

Abstract: Symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy provides a powerful framework for
probing the internal structure of quantum many-body states by decomposing
entanglement into contributions from distinct symmetry sectors. In this work,
we apply matrix product state techniques to study the bosonic, non-Abelian
Moore-Read quantum Hall state, enabling precise numerical evaluation of both
the full counting statistics and symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our
results reveal an approximate equipartition of entanglement among symmetry
sectors, consistent with theoretical expectations and subject to finite-size
corrections. The results also show that these expectations for
symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy remain valid in the case of a
non-Abelian state where the topological sectors cannot be distinguished by the
Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry alone, and where neutral and charged modes
possess distinct velocities. We additionally perform a detailed comparison of
the entanglement spectrum with predictions from the Li-Haldane conjecture,
finding remarkable agreement, and enabling a more precise understanding of the
effects of the distinct neutral and charged velocities. This not only provides
a stringent test of the conjecture but also highlights its explanatory power in
understanding the origin and structure of finite-size effects across different
symmetry sectors.

Abstract: Quantum sensing with individual spin defects has emerged as a versatile
platform to probe microscopic properties of condensed matter systems. Here we
demonstrate that quantum relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in
diamond can reveal the anisotropic spin dynamics of altermagnetic insulators
together with their characteristic spin polarised bands. We show that the
distance and orientation dependent relaxation rate of a nearby quantum impurity
encodes signatures of momentum space anisotropy in the spin diffusion response,
a hallmark of altermagnetic order. This directional sensitivity is
unprecedented in the landscape of quantum materials sensing, and it enables the
distinction of altermagnets from conventional antiferromagnets via local,
noninvasive measurements. Our results could spark new NV-sensing experiments on
spin transport and symmetry breaking in altermagnets, and highlight the role of
NV orientation to probe anisotropic phenomena in condensed matter systems.

Abstract: Microcavity exciton-polariton condensates under additional transverse
confinement constitute a flexible optical platform to study the coupling
mechanism between confined nonequilibrium and nonlinear states of matter.
Driven far from equilibrium, polariton condensates can display spontaneous
synchronization and instabilities depending on excitation and material
parameters, showcasing emergent and intricate interference patterns based on
mode competition over mutual gain landscapes. Here, we explore this coupling
mechanism between polariton condensates populating the first excited ${\it
p}$-state manifold of coupled optically trapped condensates and show a rich
structure of patterns based on excitation parameters. The optical
reconfigurability of the laser excitation patterns enables the creation of an
annular-shaped beam to confine polaritons in a tailored trapping potential,
whilst the dissipative nature of the optical traps enables effective
interaction with neighboring condensates. Our results underpin the potential
role of polariton condensates in exploring and simulating $\sigma$ and $\pi$
molecular bonding mechanisms between artificial two-dimensional diatomic
orbitals and beyond.

Abstract: The tenfold classification provides a powerful framework for organizing
topological phases of matter based on symmetry and spatial dimension. However,
it does not offer a systematic method for transitioning between classes or
engineering materials to realize desired topological properties. In this work,
we introduce a general method for designing topological materials by embedding
defects or spatial textures, which alter symmetry or dimension. This enables
controlled navigation across the tenfold table, allowing one to induce
topological phase transitions on demand. We illustrate this approach through
several nontrivial examples, demonstrating how local defects can generate
phases with different symmetries and topological invariants.

Abstract: Expanding the moir\'e material library continues to unlock novel quantum
phases and emergent electronic behaviors. In this work, we introduce PbI2 into
the moir\'e family and investigate the magnetotransport properties of moir\'e
superlattice in a hexagonal boron nitride/graphene/PbI2 heterostructures. In
high-field quantum Hall regime, we observe a robust dissipationless transport
at charge neutrality point, indicative of incompressible states stabilized at
the filling factor vh = 0. Additionally, a fractional conductance plateau at
2/3 e2/h emerges, which we attribute to a Chern junction between domains with
distinct Chern numbers originating from moir\'e-modulated and conventional
integer quantum Hall states. The moir\'e Hofstadter spectrum displays an
unconventional flavor sequence, likely influenced by proximity-induced
spin-orbit coupling from the PbI2 layer. We also see coherent electronic
interference along lines with Chern number vm = -2. These findings position
PbI2-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for realizing
spin-orbit-enhanced moir\'e phenomena and engineering coherent edge transport
in two-dimensional quantum materials.

Abstract: We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum
carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs).
Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a
viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when
the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation
length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing
ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the
magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures
such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for
both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing
magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between
antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like
effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions
for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying
intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic
insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and
exploring collective spin transport phenomena.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that topological quantum spin Hall (QSH) state exist
in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. However, a
comprehensive theoretical characterization of the topological edge states
remains a topic of interest and an unresolved issue. Here, the topological
transport properties of the twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers are investigated. Beyond
the conventional single QSH, we identify emergent double and quartuple quantum
spin Hall states, hosting two and four pairs of counter-propagating helical
edge channels respectively. Furthermore, the charge carriers in these edge
states are not localized at edge but rather the high potential point of the
moire superlattice boundary, undergoing interlayer transitions and propagating
forward continuously. We term these edge states as moire edge states. These
edge states can survive in non-magnetic disorder, with the robustness of double
QSH states surpassing that of single QSH states. At a twisting angle of
2.45$^\circ$, the transition between the single and double QSH states can be
achieved by adjusting the gate on the surface. Based on this, we propose a
five-terminal device to as a topological current devider. Our findings provide
support for the development of dissipationless spintronics.

Abstract: Multiexcitons (MXs) in quantum dots (QDs) manifest many body interactions
under quantum confinement. Beyond this fundamental interest, MXs are of
importance in numerous optoelectronic applications including QD lasing, light
emitting diodes and photocatalysis. Yet, the strong interactions between MXs
leading to rapid non-radiative decay introduce challenges for their
characterization. While so far, the measurement techniques rely either on
indirect methods or on single particle studies, herein we introduce a new
method to study MXs in QD ensembles utilizing spectrally resolved time-gated
heralded spectroscopy. With this approach we extract the biexciton binding
energies in a series of CdSe/CdS QD ensembles of several core/shell sizes,
manifesting a transition between attractive and repulsive exciton-exciton
interactions. Additionally, for triexcitons, which involve occupation of two
excitons in the 1s energy levels, as well as one exciton in the 1p energy
levels, we address the open issues of isolating the spectra of the two
triexciton pathways from one another and from high-order MXs, and extract the
MX lifetimes. The measurements on ensembles provide high photon counts and low
noise levels, and alongside the time-gated heralded approach thus enable the
observation of MX characteristics that are difficult to resolve in single
particle studies. The approach can be further implemented in the
characterization of the energies and lifetimes of MXs in other QD systems to
enable rapid characterization and understanding of the MX properties. Such
insight bears relevance to optoelectronic applications ranging from lasing to
electroluminescent devices to quantum light sources.

Abstract: Generally, stacking two monolayer type-I quantum spin Hall insulators gives
rise to a trivial insulator. However, whether or not stacking two type-II
quantum spin Hall insulators results in a trivial insulator has not yet been
explored. In this letter, based on the calculations of lattice model, we
demonstrate that stacking two type-II quantum spin Hall insulators does not
yield a trivial insulator, but instead forms a quantum spin Hall insulator with
high spin Chern number. In this phase, there are two pairs of topological edge
states with opposite chirality and polarization coexisting in the boundary. Our
calculations further reveal that the quantized spin Hall conductance of the
bilayer is twice that of the monolayer. When U(1) symmetry is present, the high
spin Chern number phase remains stable; when U(1) symmetry is broken, it
persists over a broad parameter range. Furthermore, based on the
first-principles electronic structure calculations, we propose that bilayer
Nb$_2$SeTeO is a type-II quantum spin Hall insulator with high spin Chern
number. Finally, extending this strategy to multilayer stacks naturally leads
to quantum spin Hall insulator with larger spin Chern number. Our work not only
deepens the distinction between type-I and type-II quantum spin Hall
insulators, but also offers a route toward realizing highly quantized spin Hall
conductance.

Abstract: We develop a unified theory of weakly probed differential observables for

this theory to various quantum dot systems, including multichannel Kondo,

the microscopic theories is characterized by a set of universal relations
connecting conductance and thermoelectrics with noise. Violations of these
relations indicate additional energy scales emerging in a system.

Abstract: We report the creation and characterization of a molecular-scale negative
differential conductance (NDC) device by assembling a triangular trimer of
4,5,9,10-tetrabromo-1,3,6,8-tetraazapyrene (TBTAP) molecules on a
superconducting Pb(111) substrate. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling
spectroscopy, we observe robust NDC behavior manifesting as a decrease in
current with increasing voltage between 0.7-0.9 V arising from the interplay of
Coulomb blockade and strong inter-molecular capacitive coupling within the
molecular cluster. Gate-controlled charging and discharging processes are
directly visualized via two-dimensional differential conductance mapping, which
reveals the emergence of Coulomb rings and spatial regions of NDC. Theoretical
modeling using a three-impurity Anderson model and master equation approach
quantitatively reproduces the experimental observations and demonstrates that
the NDC emerges purely from electron correlations, independent of the
underlying superconductivity. By tuning the geometry to a hexamer structure, we
further show that cluster topology provides versatile control over electronic
properties at the molecular scale. These results establish a functional
platform for implementing multifunctional molecular devices and highlight a
strategy toward programmable and scalable nanoelectronics.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for inertial spin-wave dynamics in
three-dimensional twisted soft-magnetic nanostrips, where curvature and torsion
couple with magnetic inertia to generate terahertz (THz) magnetic oscillations.
The resulting spin-wave spectra exhibit pronounced nonreciprocity due to
effective symmetry breaking arising from geometric chirality and inertial
effects. We show that this behavior is governed by a curvature-induced
geometric (Berry) phase, which we analytically capture through compact
expressions for dispersion relations and spectral linewidths in both nutational
(THz) and precessional (GHz) regimes. Topological variations, including
M\"obius and helical geometries, impose distinct wavenumber quantization rules,
elucidating the role of topology in spin-wave transport. These results position
twisted magnetic strips as a viable platform for curvilinear THz magnonics and
nonreciprocal spintronic applications.
