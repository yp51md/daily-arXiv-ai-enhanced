Our approach uses Stern-Gerlach interferometers (SGIs)\nequipped with a novel dual sensing technique, combining non-destructive\ntransparent sensors (TSs) and projective opaque detectors (ODs), to test\nfoundational principles in a closed system. The first stage employs a single\nSGI with dual sensors to search for anomalous \"delayed-choice\" events that\nchallenge the instantaneous collapse of CI and the global branching of MWI. The\nsecond stage involves a full-loop SGI with two TSs and one OD to investigate\nrecoherence phenomena, which would violate both CI and MWI if observed.\nFinally, the third stage introduces a second full-loop SGI with a test ion to\ngenerate an electromagnetic phase shift, enabling discrimination between\nretrocausal and unitary recoherence mechanisms. Successfully observing these\nrare anomalies, while without breaking any conservation laws, would offer\nstrong evidence for the local branching framework of BHSI, showing a fuzzy\nquantum-classical boundary within dual sensing.
