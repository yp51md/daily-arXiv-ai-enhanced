Although chemical functionalization can significantly enhance graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance, it often degrades graphene's intrinsic in-plane phonon transport. In this work, we perform a systematic deep neural network molecular dynamics study comparing edge-functionalized graphene nanoribbons with surface-functionalized graphene in aqueous environments. We demonstrate that functionalizing only 10% of the ribbon edges with hydroxyl groups increases the graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance by more than eightfold, primarily due to strengthened interfacial interactions and improved wettability at the edges. In contrast to basal-plane oxidation, edge functionalization largely preserves in-plane thermal conductivity. Importantly, hydroxyl edge groups exert competing effects on phonon transport: they introduce additional boundary scattering that suppresses heat conduction, while simultaneously passivating dangling bonds at bare edges, thereby reducing phonon localization and edge-induced scattering. This competition leads to a non-monotonic dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity on edge functionalization ratio. These results establish edge functionalization as an effective strategy for enhancing graphene-water interfacial thermal transport without sacrificing intrinsic phonon transport properties."}

During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions."}

Here, we introduce an artificial Kagome superlattice in bilayer graphene, engineered via nanopatterning of the dielectric substrate to create a precisely defined and electrostatically tunable periodic potential. Magnetotransport measurements reveal the emergence of a stack of correlated insulating states at moderate superlattice potentials, characteristic of strong electron-electron interactions within Kagome-induced flat bands. As temperature increases, these correlated gaps collapse, signaling the thermal suppression of interaction-driven states.

It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface."}

Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust. Finally, we show how the gaps arise from hybridization of edge states due to the finite width."}

We analyze how such non-reversible control reshapes the macroscopic dynamical regimes of the phase transitions recently identified in generative diffusion models. We derive a general criterion for the speciation time and show that suitable non-reversible perturbations can accelerate speciation. In contrast, the collapse transition is governed by a trace-controlled phase-space contraction mechanism that is fixed by the symmetric component, and the corresponding collapse time remains unchanged under anti-symmetric perturbations. Numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models support these findings."}

Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges."}

While the triangular Sn(1x1) interface exhibits a robust metallic band structure, the decoupled QFMLG maintains charge neutrality, confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy. Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, we distinguish between direct intercalation and diffusion-driven expansion, identifying the latter as the critical pathway to superior QFMLG crystalline quality. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals dynamical structural coupling between the decoupled QFMLG and the Sn interface, providing a novel degree of freedom for strain engineering.

This instability implies that local perturbations can lead to macroscopic correlation profiles, a breaking of clustering properties and even macroscopic quantum superpositions. In this work, we investigate the effect of interaction on this phenomenology by considering an interacting model with conserved domain wall number, that possesses a ferromagnetic ground state breaking the Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We first show that a local quench in this system amplifies quantum interferences, producing a macroscopic magnetisation profile that directly reflects the scattering phase of the model. Then, we use two asymmetry measures, namely the Entanglement Asymmetry (EA) and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), to characterise the quantum coherence associated with the fluctuations of the magnetisation. By focusing on subsystems comparable in size to the light-cone of the perturbation, we confirm the emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence throughout the whole perturbed region. Finally, we discuss the link between EA and QFI and show that the variance/EA inequality for pure state can be generalised to a QFI/EA inequality for mixed states."}

Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 < α< \\infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \\sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges.

Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an \"exceptional horn\" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta.

In this work, we present a fully quantum methodology to compute thermal conductivity based on Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations combined with the Green-Kubo linear response theory. The method is applied to crystalline argon modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential, a paradigmatic system where quantum effects strongly affect both thermodynamic and transport properties. From PIMC simulations, we obtain the temperature-dependent phonon frequencies, lifetimes, and specific heat. From the imaginary time correlations of the energy current, we extract the thermal transport coefficients based on a physically motivated prior. We show that the experimentally observed increase of the thermal conductivity at low temperatures cannot be explained within a standard Peierls-Boltzmann framework or quasi-harmonic approximation using phonon lifetimes alone. Instead, a distinct transport lifetime emerges from the analysis of heat-current correlations. Our results demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo methods provide a robust, non-perturbative framework to investigate heat transport in insulating solids, beyond the limits of classical molecular dynamics and quasi-harmonic approximations."}

This transition signals the emergence of topological complexity in the model, where higher-order structures develop self-similarly across scales. Beyond this transition, the network exhibits self-similar topological growth, evidenced by a power-law decay in the increments of $Δ$-simplices with $m$-dependent exponents. An analogous transition occurs in the Betti numbers, which display self-similar behavior near the TT and an arctangent dependence farther from it. Based on simulation data, we propose explicit scaling relations describing the behavior of both $Δ$-simplices and Betti numbers near the TT.

In this work, we study the influence of a Silicon capping layer on film properties and on the performance of SNSPDs. A Silicon capping layer effectively suppresses oxidation and increases the superconducting transition temperature. This enables superconductivity in films as thin as 3 nm at 3 K, increases critical current in patterned nanowires and significantly extends the saturation plateau from the visible to the near infrared (up to 2050 nm): These detectors maintain sub-50 ps timing jitter, even for nanowires as wide as 250 nm and with detection areas of 20x20μm2.

While there exists an extensive framework to study contractivity for time-independent Lindbladians, their time-dependent counterparts are far less well understood. In this paper, we study the contractivity of Lindbladians, which have a fixed dissipator (describing the interaction with an environment), but with a time-dependent driving Hamiltonian.

Focusing on the MaxCut problem with global bit-flip symmetry, we analyze reduced QAOA instances obtained by fixing a single variable and study how this choice affects the associated DLAs. We show that the structure of the DLAs can change dramatically depending on which variable is held fixed. In particular, we construct explicit examples where the dimension collapses from exponential to quadratic, uncovering phenomena that do not appear in the original formulation.\n  Numerical experiments on asymmetric graphs indicate that such reductions often produce DLAs of much smaller dimension, suggesting improved trainability. We also prove that any graph can be embedded into a slightly larger one (requiring only quadratic overhead) such that the standard reduced DLA coincides with the free reduced DLA, in most cases implying exponential dimension and irreducibility on the Hilbert space for reduced QAOA instances. These results establish symmetry-aware reduction as a principled tool for designing expressive and potentially trainable QAOA circuits."}

In this paper, we explore how reinforcement learning can be used to compute a class of Euclidean path integrals that yield the thermal density matrix of a quantum system, thereby enabling the computation of the free energy or other thermal expectation values. In particular, we propose a two-step approach with the unique feature that after a variational approximation for a quantity is obtained in a first step, it can then be used to efficiently compute the exact result in a second step. We benchmark this method on several simple systems and then apply it to the quantum rotor chain."}

TNQE first represents each classical input via a TN decomposition and then compiles the resulting tensor cores into an encoding circuit through two complementary core-to-circuit strategies. To make this compilation trainable while respecting the unitary nature of quantum operations, we introduce a unitary-aware constraint that parameterizes TN cores as learnable block unitaries, enabling them to be directly optimized and directly encoded as quantum operators. The proposed TNQE framework enables explicit control over circuit depth and qubit resources, allowing the construction of shallow, resource-efficient circuits. Across a range of benchmarks, TNQE achieves encoding circuits as shallow as $0.04\\times$ the depth of amplitude encoding, while naturally scaling to high-resolution images ($256 \\times 256$) and demonstrating practical feasibility on real quantum hardware."}

Such constraints can give rise to striking and counter-intuitive phenomena, including local broadcasting of entangled states and failures of entanglement monogamy. These effects naturally arise in tomographically nonlocal theories (like real quantum theory, twirled worlds, or fermionic quantum theory), where composite systems possess holistic degrees of freedom that are inaccessible to local measurements. In this work, we study entanglement in such theories within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We show that the failure of tomographic locality leads to two qualitatively distinct forms of entanglement, which we term $\\textit{tomographically-local}$ entanglement and $\\textit{tomographically-nonlocal}$ entanglement. We analyze the operational consequences of this distinction, proving that tomographically-nonlocal entanglement is useless for Bell nonlocality, steering, and teleportation, but sufficient for dense coding and perfectly secure data hiding. This framework clarifies the origin of several previously puzzling features of entanglement that arise when tomographic locality fails, as can happen even in quantum theory when one considers fermions or fundamental superselection rules."}

Categorical quantum mechanics (CQM) makes precise why ``copy'' and ``delete'' are not generic quantum operations: they exist only for a realized \\emph{classical data} sector (a preferred basis/observable; a commutative structure). Decoherence explains how a pointer basis can be selected dynamically, but it does not by itself select a unique outcome. This motivates a neutral presentation of the main ontological options (unique-history, decohered multiplicity, agent-relative facticity, and a stochastic foundation with variable diffusion). We also note the relevance of the ``agency constraint'' argued by Adlam-McQueen-Waegell: in a strictly coherent, basis-unselected ``purely quantum'' regime, minimal agency fails due to no-cloning and linearity, which sharpens the role of classical resources for record-based processes. Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios then serve as a stress test, since they treat ``friends'' simultaneously as coherent quantum systems and as agents possessing stable records. Finally, a stochastic-mechanics foundation (with variable diffusion) offers a continuous bridge between quantum and classical regimes, and suggests a principled way to implement measurement update as conditioning plus a time-symmetric minimal-change rule."}

Physically relevant quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise are generically non-Markovian and analytically intractable. Further, their Markovian limits are generically inequivalent when using either the Ito or Stratonovich conventions for the same quantum stochastic processes. We introduce a quantum noise homogenization scheme that temporally coarse-grains non-Markovian, colored-noise driven quantum stochastic processes and connects them to their effective white-noise (Markovian) limits. Our approach uses a novel phase-space augmentation that maps the non-Markovian dynamics into a higher dimensional Markovian system and then applies a controlled perturbative coarse-graining scheme in the characteristic time scales of the noise. This allows an explicit analytical algorithm to derive effective Markovian generators with renormalized coefficients and enables imposing various physical constraints on them. We thus resolve the Ito-Stratonovich ambiguity for multiplicative colored noise driven quantum stochastic processes, wherein we show that their consistent Markovian limit corresponds to the Stratonovich convention with renormalized coefficients as well as Ito correction terms. By assuming their Markovian limit unravels completely positive, trace-preserving maps, we further characterize a physically relevant family of non-Markovian quantum stochastic processes driven by multiplicative colored noise."}

This enhancement persists in the sub-shot-noise regime, where the classical signal becomes buried in the spectral background while the two-photon contribution remains resolvable.

For this purpose, the contributions of the electromagnetic waves with the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations to the Casimir force are computed using the Lifshitz theory expressed in terms of the pure imaginary Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions are found using an equivalent formulation of the Lifshitz theory along the real frequency axis. All computations are performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plates using the Drude model and the experimentally consistent plasma model over the separation region from 0.5 to 6~mum, where the total force value is determined by conduction electrons. It is shown that the transverse magnetic contribution to the Casimir force does not depend on the used model of the dielectric permittivity, so that the total difference between the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the measurement data is determined by the transverse electric contribution. In doing so, as opposed to the case of nonmagnetic metals, both fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in this contribution depend on the model of the dielectric permittivity used in computations, whereas the magnetic properties of the plate metal influence the Casimir force solely through the fraction of propagating waves in the transverse electric contribution. The issue of a more adequate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of magnetic metals is discussed."}

It is concluded that the reason for this mystery, and thereby the related mysteries of complementarity, non-commutativity of observables, the uncertainty principle and violation of Bell's equality, is that the axioms of QM depend vitally on the continuum nature of Hilbert Space, deemed unphysical. We develop a theory of quantum physics - Rational Quantum Mechanics (RaQM) - in which Hilbert Space is gravitationally discretised. The key to solving the mysteries of QM in RaQM is a number-theoretic property of the cosine function, concealed in QM when angles range over the continuum. This number-theoretic property describes mathematically the utter indivisibility of the quantum world and implies that the laws of physics are profoundly holistic. We contrast holism with nonlocality. In theories which embrace the continuum, the violation of Bell's inequality requires the laws of physics to be either nonlocal or not realistic; both incomprehensible concepts. By contrast, holism, as embodied in Mach's Principle or in the fractal geometry of a chaotic attractor, is neither incomprehensible nor unphysical. As part of this, we solve the deepest mystery of all; why nature makes use of complex numbers."}

The asymmetry results from asymmetric coin operations, asymmetric initial states, and asymmetric polarization-dependent losses. By varying these asymmetry factors, the inverse participation ratio and entanglement entropy of the walker are numerically calculated for different coin and loss parameters, both for symmetric and asymmetric initial states. We then experimentally implement a 16-step asymmetric DTQW using a time-multiplexing fiber loop structure. By choosing an asymmetric initial state, both coin-position entanglement and delocalization are simultaneously enhanced under specific coin parameters. Moreover, we observe that with finite asymmetric polarization-dependent loss, the photon probability on the left side decreases significantly, while that on the right side increases and becomes more localized. Interestingly, under specific coin parameters, the entanglement and delocalization exhibit improved robustness against polarization-dependent loss. These results demonstrate that the DTQWs constitute an ideal platform for investigating photonic delocalization and hybrid entanglement."}

The local bound on nonlocal predictability is defined as the maximum probability with which one observer can correctly predict the other's measurement outcome prior to measurement. We show that product states always meet this bound, while all pure entangled states and some classically correlated states can exceed it. This demonstrates a nonlocal phenomenon since the predictability of measurement outcomes increases after the measurement. Perfect nonlocal predictability for arbitrary projective measurements occurs only for maximally entangled states among all pure states, underscoring their special role. Comparing pure entangled states with their dephased versions, we find that dephasing on one subsystem can enhance nonlocal predictability for a broad class of states and measurements - a counterintuitive, noise-induced advantage that vanishes for maximally entangled states under any projective measurement."}

Here, we aim to address this gap in current knowledge and consider the quantum optical HHG response from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, a finite chain of atoms with both a topologically trivial and nontrivial insulating phase, the latter supporting edge states. We find that HHG from both topological phases is squeezed at the band-gap frequency. Interestingly, while the harmonic spectrum discriminates the two topological phases of the system, the degree of squeezing only discriminates the phases for smaller chain lengths. We attribute this difference to a relative increase in overlap between bulk and edge states in the topological nontrivial phase for smaller systems. Our findings reveal how the strength of dipole couplings governs the nonclassical HHG response and define new research questions on topologically protected generation of quantum light in strong-field physics."}

Although demonstrated over short-range free-space links, long-distance implementations of intermodal quantum key distribution remain challenging, due to turbulence-induced wavefront aberrations which limit efficient single-mode fiber coupling at the optical receiver. Here, we demonstrate a real-time intermodal quantum key distribution field trial over an 18 km free-space link, connecting a remote terminal to an urban optical ground station equipped with a 40 cm-class telescope. An adaptive optics system, implementing direct wavefront sensing and high-order aberration correction, enables efficient single-mode fiber coupling and allows secure key generation of 200 bit/s using a compact state analyzer equipped with room-temperature detectors. We further validate through experimental data a turbulence-based model for predicting fiber coupling efficiency, providing practical design guidelines for future intermodal quantum networks."}

The dynamics is described by the Schrödinger equation on a curved spatial background and, when included, by minimal coupling to a magnetic vector potential incorporating an Aharonov--Bohm flux. After separation of variables, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional radial eigenvalue equation governed by an effective potential that combines torsion-induced Coulomb-like and centrifugal-like structures with magnetic/flux-dependent terms and optional model interactions. Because closed-form analytic solutions are not reliable over the parameter ranges required for systematic scans, we compute spectra and eigenfunctions numerically by formulating the radial equation as a self-adjoint Sturm--Liouville problem and solving it with a finite-difference discretization on a truncated radial domain, with explicit convergence control. We analyze four representative scenarios: (i) no external potential, (ii) Cornell-type confinement, (iii) Kratzer-type interaction, and (iv) the small-oscillation regime around the minimum of a Morse potential. We present systematic trends of the low-lying levels as functions of the torsion parameter, magnetic field, and azimuthal sector, and we show that geometric couplings alone can produce effective confinement even in the absence of an external interaction."}

For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part."}
