With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a\nstarting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden\nquenches. Using finite time path field theory perturbative methods, we show\nthat the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with\nnon-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time,\napart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for.\nAs the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing\nthe discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation\nexpansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements\non functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time\nt=0 are: (1) their Fourier transform f(p) is a function that is analytic\neverywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at p=0 and\npossibly others with Im (p) < 0, and (2) that f(p)/p converges to zero at\ninfinity in the lower complex semiplane. Prototypical function of this class is\ntanh(eta t), to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the\nswitching on time t=0. In the limit of large eta, such a perturbation\napproaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new\ntype of universal behaviour of Loschmidt echo that emerges in exponentially\nshort time scale, our previous results (Kui\\'c, D. et al. Universe 2024, 10,\n384) for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains,\nobtained by resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long time\nlimit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial\nmodifications systematically taken into account.

The interpretation goes\nfurther and proposes a set of axioms. In standard non relational language, one\nof them states that an observer can only retrieve finite amount information\nfrom a system by means of measurement. Our contribution starts with the\nobservation that quantum mechanics, i.e. quantum field theory (QFT) in\ndimension 1, radically differs from QFT in higher dimensions. In higher\ndimensions boundary data (or initial data) cannot be specified by means of\nfinitely many measurements. This calls for a notion of measuring scale, which\nwe provide. At a given measuring scale the observer has partial information\nabout the system. Our notion of measuring scale generalizes the one implicitly\nused in Wilsonian QFT, where at each measuring scale there are effective\ntheories, which may be corrected, and if the theory turns out to be\nrenormalizable the mentioned corrections converge to determine a completely\ncorrected (or renormalized) theory at the given measuring scale. The notion of\na measuring scale is the cornerstone of Wilsonian QFT. This notion tells us\nthat we are not describing a system from an absolute perspective. An effective\ntheory at that scale describes the system with respect to the observer, which\nmay retrieve information from the system by means of measurement in a specific\nway determined by our notion of measuring scale.

We apply our framework to a specific\nill-posed problem in quantum information science: recovering the locations and\nhyperfine couplings of nuclear spins surrounding a spin-defect in a\nsemiconductor from sparse, noisy coherence data. We show that a hybridized MCMC\nmethod can recover meaningful posterior distributions over physical parameters\nusing an order of magnitude less data than existing approaches, and we validate\nour results on experimental measurements. More generally, our work provides a\nflexible, extensible strategy for solving a broad class of ill-posed inverse\nproblems under realistic experimental constraints."}

At its core, the framework automates the construction of\nmin-tradeoff functions via semi-definite programming and integrates them into a\nfull entropy analysis pipeline. Users can specify device configurations,\nBell-type inequalities or probability constraints, and select entropy measures\nsuch as min-entropy or von Neumann entropy. The package further provides tools\nfor setting test parameters, computing secure randomness rates, and exploring\ntradeoffs between statistical confidence, protocol duration, and randomness\noutput. We demonstrate the framework showing how users can move from\ntheoretical constraints to practical security bounds with minimal overhead.\nThis work contributes a reproducible, modular, and extensible platform for\ncertifying quantum protocols under finite-size effects, significantly lowering\nthe skill barrier to rigorous quantum cryptographic analysis."}

In a particular realization,\nwhile the junction is completely transparent to the electric charge, magnetic\ncharge transmission is allowed only after a critical field strength. In the\nsecond class of junctions we stitch two toric codes with operators which do not\ncommute at the junction.

With a sudden local magnetic field quench as a\nstarting point, we generalize our approach to a large class of local non-sudden\nquenches. Using finite time path field theory perturbative methods, we show\nthat the difference between the sudden quench and a class of quenches with\nnon-sudden switching on the perturbation vanishes exponentially with time,\napart from non-substantial modifications that are systematically accounted for.\nAs the consequence of causality and analytic properties of functions describing\nthe discussed class of quenches, this is true at any order of perturbation\nexpansion and thus for the resummed perturbation series. The only requirements\non functions describing the perturbation strength switched on at a finite time\nt=0 are: (1) their Fourier transform f(p) is a function that is analytic\neverywhere in the lower complex semiplane, except at the simple pole at p=0 and\npossibly others with Im (p) < 0, and (2) that f(p)/p converges to zero at\ninfinity in the lower complex semiplane. Prototypical function of this class is\ntanh(eta t), to which the perturbation strength is proportional after the\nswitching on time t=0. In the limit of large eta, such a perturbation\napproaches the case of a sudden quench. It is shown that, because of this new\ntype of universal behaviour of Loschmidt echo that emerges in exponentially\nshort time scale, our previous results (Kui\\'c, D. et al. Universe 2024, 10,\n384) for the sudden local magnetic field quench of Ising and XY chains,\nobtained by resummation of the perturbative expansion, extend in the long time\nlimit to all non-sudden quench protocols in this class, with non-substantial\nmodifications systematically taken into account. We also show that analogous\nuniversal behaviour exists in disorder quenches, and ultimately global ones."}
