Reducing the problem to the Ising\nform allows the use of available quantum and quantum-inspired optimization\ntools. We demonstrate the application of a quantum-inspired optimization\nalgorithm to this problem. Our study paves the way for exploring the full\npotential of quantum and quantum-inspired optimization tools in biological\napplications."}

We study the dynamical properties of the $\\beta$-ensemble\nwhere the critical energy controls the characteristic timescales. In\nparticular, the spectral form factor equilibrates at a relaxation time,\n$t_\\mathrm{R} \\equiv E_c^{-1}$, which is parametrically smaller than the\nHeisenberg time, $t_\\mathrm{H}$, given by the inverse of the mean level\nspacing. Incidentally, the dimensionless relaxation time, $\\tau_\\mathrm{R}\n\\equiv t_\\mathrm{R}/t_\\mathrm{H} \\ll 1$ is equal to the Dyson index, $\\beta$.\nWe show that the energy correlations are absent within a temporal window\n$t_\\mathrm{R} < t < t_\\mathrm{H}$, which we term as the correlation void. This\nis in contrast to the mechanism of equilibration in a typical many-body system.\nWe analytically explain the qualitative behavior of the number variance and the\nspectral form factor of the $\\beta$-ensemble by a spatially local mapping to\nthe Anderson model."}
