We show that classical dynamical behavior, as\nquantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics\nof the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with\nregular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising\nfrom chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries\nconstrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and\nenforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of\nthe phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize\nphase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation\nratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's\nsupport.

This localization arises from long-range phase\ncorrelations introduced by a spatially varying dissipation phase parameter,\nwhich enables nontrivial interference in the steady-state.

However,\nrecent insights into engineered dissipation reveal that it can be tuned to\nfacilitate various quantum effects, from state stabilization to phase\ntransitions. In this work, we identify aperiodic dissipation as a mechanism for\ninducing steady-state localization, independent of disorder or a quasiperiodic\npotential in the Hamiltonian. This localization arises from long-range phase\ncorrelations introduced by a spatially varying dissipation phase parameter,\nwhich enables nontrivial interference in the steady-state.

A range of randomised algorithms,\nincluding eigenstate property estimation by spectral filters, Hamiltonian\nsimulation, and perturbative quantum simulation, though motivated and designed\nfor different applications, share common features in the use of unitary\ndecomposition and Hadamard-test-based implementation. In this work, we start by\nanalysing the role of randomised linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU) in\nquantum simulations, and present several quantum circuits that realise the\nrandomised composite LCU. A caveat of randomisation, however, is that the\nresulting state cannot be deterministically prepared, which often takes an\nunphysical form $U \\rho V^\\dagger$ with unitaries $U$ and $V$. Therefore,\nrandomised LCU algorithms are typically restricted to only estimating the\nexpectation value of a single Pauli operator. To address this, we introduce a\nquantum instrument that can realise a non-completely-positive map, whose\nfeature of frequent measurement and reset on the ancilla makes it particularly\nsuitable in the fault-tolerant regime. We then show how to construct an\nunbiased estimator of the effective (unphysical) state $U \\rho V^\\dagger$ and\nits generalisation. Moreover, we demonstrate how to effectively realise the\nstate prepared by applying an operator that admits a composite LCU form. Our\nresults reveal a natural connection between randomised LCU algorithms and\nshadow tomography, thereby allowing simultaneous estimation of many observables\nefficiently. As a concrete example, we construct the estimators and present the\nsimulation complexity for three use cases of randomised LCU in Hamiltonian\nsimulation and eigenstate preparation tasks."}
