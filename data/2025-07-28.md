### [1] [Analysis of RF Surface Loss in a Planar 2D Qubit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18672)
*Andrei Lunin,Mustafa Bal,Akshay Murthy,Shaojiang Zhu,Anna Grassellino,Alexander Romanenko*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文研究了超导量子比特中的微波表面损耗，提出了估算纳米级超薄膜能量参与比的渐近方法，并评估了最小射频损耗的极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提升量子比特的相干时间（T1），需要理解并减少超导量子比特中的主要退相干源——表面氧化层的介电损耗。

Method: 采用数值研究的方法，分析不同设计的超导量子比特中微波表面损耗，并提出估算纳米级超薄膜能量参与比的渐近方法。

Result: 给出了最小射频损耗的极限，这些极限取决于表面氧化层和衬底材料的电学特性。

Conclusion: 通过优化表面氧化层和衬底界面，可以显著减少超导量子比特的微波表面损耗，从而延长相干时间。

Abstract: The Josephson junction and shunt capacitor form a transmon qubit, which is
the cornerstone of modern quantum computing platforms. For reliable quantum
computing, it is important how long a qubit can remain in a superposition of
quantum states, which is determined by the coherence time (T1). The coherence
time of a qubit effectively sets the "lifetime" of usable quantum information,
determining how long quantum computations can be performed before errors occur
and information is lost. There are several sources of decoherence in transmon
qubits, but the predominant one is generally considered to be dielectric losses
in the natural oxide layer formed on the surface of the superconductor. In this
paper, we present a numerical study of microwave surface losses in planar
superconducting antennas of different transmon qubit designs. An asymptotic
method for estimating the energy participation ratio in ultrathin films of
nanometer scales is proposed, and estimates are given for the limits of
achievable minimum RF losses depending on the electrical properties of the
surface oxide and the interface of the qubit with the substrate material.

### [2] [Correspondence principle, dissipation, and Ginibre ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18704)
*David Villaseñor,Hua Yan,Matic Orel,Marko Robnik*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了量子与经典行为对应关系在耗散量子混沌中的局限性，发现Ginibre谱关联并非耗散量子混沌的普适诊断工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子混沌与经典混沌的对应关系，特别是在耗散系统中，以验证Ginibre谱关联的普适性。

Method: 重新研究周期性受击阻尼系统，通过系统探索广泛参数空间，达到半经典极限。

Result: 发现即使在原型系统中，基于谱关联的对应原则也失效。

Conclusion: Ginibre谱关联既非稳健也非耗散量子混沌的普适诊断工具。

Abstract: The correspondence between quantum and classical behavior has been essential
since the advent of quantum mechanics. This principle serves as a cornerstone
for understanding quantum chaos, which has garnered increased attention due to
its strong impact in various theoretical and experimental fields. When
dissipation is considered, quantum chaos takes concepts from isolated quantum
chaos to link classical chaotic motion with spectral correlations of Ginibre
ensembles. This correspondence was first identified in periodically kicked
systems with damping, but it has been shown to break down in dissipative
atom-photon systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240404 (2024)]. In this
contribution, we revisit the original kicked model and perform a systematic
exploration across a broad parameter space, reaching a genuine semiclassical
limit. Our results demonstrate that the correspondence principle, as defined
through this spectral connection, fails even in this prototypical system. These
findings provide conclusive evidence that Ginibre spectral correlations are
neither a robust nor a universal diagnostic of dissipative quantum chaos.

### [3] [Photon condensation from thermal sources and the limits of heat engines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19128)
*Luisa Toledo Tude,Emily Haughton,Paul R. Eastham*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了染料填充微腔中光子气体的玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚条件，发现阈值泵浦温度由热力学第二定律决定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在染料填充微腔中实现光子气体凝聚的条件，特别是通过染料驱动或外部热光子库（如阳光）实现凝聚的可能性。

Method: 分析了染料驱动和外部热库耦合两种情况下的凝聚条件，并比较了不同能级腔体的阈值温度。

Result: 发现可逆三能级热机的阈值温度最低，染料驱动和两能级腔体外部泵浦可实现这一阈值；多能级腔体的阈值温度更高，归因于不可逆热传递和熵增。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了光子气体凝聚的热力学限制，为高效光热转换提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The trapping and cooling of photon gases in microcavities has been used to
create Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the conditions required for
condensation in dye-filled microcavities, with photon populations created
either by driving a transition of the dye or by coupling to an external thermal
photon reservoir such as sunlight. We show that the threshold pump temperature,
above which condensation appears, is determined by the second law of
thermodynamics. The minimum achievable threshold is that of a reversible
three-level heat engine, which we show arises in the dye-pumped case, and for
the external pumping of a two-level cavity. For a many-level cavity
condensation occurs at a similar but higher temperature. The increase is
attributed to irreversible heat transfers and the associated entropy
production.

### [4] [Average-computation benchmarking for local expectation values in digital quantum devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18708)
*Flavio Baccari,Pavel Kos,Georgios Styliaris*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过结合目标计算及其变体来评估量子计算质量的方法，保留了电路架构和深度，同时通过空间-时间通道检测噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子设备的发展，评估整体计算质量变得更具挑战性，需要超越单操作性能测试的方法。

Method: 通过将每个门替换为类似门的集合，形成空间-时间通道，保留电路架构和深度，并通过半定规划找到新的集合。

Result: 该方法能够检测超出Clifford基准测试范围的噪声，且只需运行有限数量的电路实现即可估计期望值。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估量子计算质量提供了新途径，适用于任意砖块电路，并具有实际可行性。

Abstract: As quantum devices progress towards a quantum advantage regime, they become
harder to benchmark. A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality
of the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single
operation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target
computation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically
solvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the
circuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a
classically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an
ensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time
channels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce
explicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to
arbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones
through semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains
important information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise
beyond a Clifford benchmarking regime. Moreover, we provide evidence that
estimating average-computation expectation values requires running only a
limited number of different circuit realizations.

### [5] [Pulse-based optimization of quantum many-body states with Rydberg atoms in optical tweezer arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19153)

Result: 在10量子比特系统内，成功制备了一维反铁磁海森堡模型和混合场伊辛模型的基态。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方案能高效测量目标多体哈密顿量的成本函数，为量子模拟提供了新途径。

Abstract: We explore a pulse-based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for
Rydberg atoms in optical tweezer arrays and evaluate its performance on
prototypical quantum spin models. We numerically demonstrate that the ground
states of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model and the
mixed-field Ising model can be accurately prepared using an adaptive update
algorithm that randomly segments pulse sequences, for systems of up to ten
qubits. Furthermore, we propose and validate a hybrid scheme that integrates
this pulse-level analog quantum algorithm with a variational quantum gate
approach, where digital quantum gates are approximated by optimized analog
pulses. This enables efficient measurement of the cost function for target
many-body Hamiltonians.

### [6] [Non-perturbative switching rates in bistable open quantum systems: from driven Kerr oscillators to dissipative cat qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18714)
*Léon Carde,Ronan Gautier,Nicolas Didier,Alexandru Petrescu,Joachim Cohen,Alexander McDonald*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 使用路径积分技术预测单模双稳态开放量子系统的切换速率，推广到满足隐藏时间反转对称性的量子系统，为猫量子比特架构提供精确的比特翻转错误率估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅适用于高斯噪声和经典详细平衡系统，需推广到更广泛的量子系统，尤其是满足隐藏时间反转对称性的系统。

Method: 采用路径积分技术，结合隐藏时间反转对称性，推导切换速率的解析表达式。

Result: 为猫量子比特架构提供了精确的比特翻转错误率估计，避免了昂贵的数值模拟。

Conclusion: 该方法为探索多稳态单体和多体开放量子系统的切换现象开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In this work, we use path integral techniques to predict the switching rate
in a single-mode bistable open quantum system. While analytical expressions are
well-known to be accessible for systems subject to Gaussian noise obeying
classical detailed balance, we generalize this approach to a class of quantum
systems, those which satisfy the recently-introduced hidden time-reversal
symmetry [1]. In particular, in the context of quantum computing, we deliver
precise estimates of bit-flip error rates in cat-qubit architectures,
circumventing the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results open new
avenues for exploring switching phenomena in multistable single- and many-body
open quantum systems.

### [7] [Secure One-Sided Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution Under Collective Attacks with Enhanced Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18744)
*Pritam Roy,Subhankar Bera,A. S. Majumdar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了在单侧设备独立（1sDI）设置下的量子密钥分发（QKD）协议安全性，平衡了实验可行性与最小信任假设。通过分析推导了渐近密钥率的下界，并展示了其在检测效率较低时的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种介于设备依赖（DD-QKD）和设备独立（DI-QKD）之间的量子密钥分发协议，以平衡实验可行性与安全性。

Method: 利用线性量子导向不等式（CJWR不等式）分析安全性，推导渐近密钥率下界，并通过对称性简化分析。

Result: 协议在去极化噪声下容忍更高的量子比特错误率（QBER），且在非信任侧检测效率较低时仍能生成安全密钥。

Conclusion: 1sDI-QKD在当前技术下具有可行性，并作为基于导向的安全量子通信替代方案具有优势。

Abstract: We study the security of a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol under the
one-sided device-independent (1sDI) setting, which assumes trust in only one
party's measurement device. This approach effectively provides a balance
between the experimental viability of device-dependent (DD-QKD) and the minimal
trust assumptions of device-independent (DI-QKD). An analytical lower bound on
the asymptotic key rate is derived to provide security against collective
attacks, in which the eavesdropper's information is limited only by the
function of observed violation of a linear quantum steering inequality,
specifically the three-setting Cavalcanti--Jones--Wiseman--Reid (CJWR)
inequality. We provide a closed-form key rate formula by reducing the security
analysis to mixtures of Bell-diagonal states by utilizing symmetries of the
steering functional. We show that the protocol tolerates higher quantum bit
error rates (QBER) than present DI-QKD protocols by benchmarking its
performance under depolarizing noise. Furthermore, we explore the impact of
detection inefficiencies and show that, in contrast to DI-QKD, which requires
near-perfect detection, secure key generation can be achieved even with lower
detection efficiency on the untrusted side. These findings demonstrate the
viability of using 1sDI-QKD with current technology and highlight its
advantages as a steering-based substitute for secure quantum communication.

### [8] [Fully quantum description of the four-wave mixing contribution to correlated Stokes-anti-Stokes scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18751)
*Raul Corrêa,Marcelo F. Santos,Carlos H. Monken,Ado Jorio*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个完全量子化的理论模型，用于描述拉曼散射中的斯托克斯-反斯托克斯（SaS）散射过程，并证明了其可用于产生纠缠光子对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于SaS散射能产生纠缠光子对，但其量子理论描述尚不完善，因此需要建立一个完整的量子理论框架。

Method: 采用量子微扰理论对海森堡算子进行求解，推导出材料电极化的量子表达式，并分析SaS散射的四波混频现象。

Result: 研究发现SaS散射在一阶微扰中出现，且量子形式推导的三阶非线性光学极化率与经典场中的结果一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为SaS散射提供了完整的量子理论描述，支持其在量子光学技术中的应用。

Abstract: The process in which Raman scattering produces correlated Stokes and
anti-Stokes radiation is known as Stokes-anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering. It has
been shown recently that this process can generate entangled photon pairs,
making it a promising tool for quantum optical technologies, but a proper
quantum theoretical description was lacking. In this paper, a fully quantum
derivation of the electric polarization in a medium with vibrational Raman
response, with quantized electromagnetic fields, is developed. Using quantum
perturbation theory for Heisenberg operators, we find the solution for the
material electric polarization and show that the correlated SaS scattering
appears in the first order of perturbation, corresponding to a four-wave mixing
phenomenon. We also discuss how to construct the third-order non-linear optical
susceptibility for the SaS scattering from the quantum formalism, and show that
it coincides with the one derived for classical fields in stimulated Raman.

### [9] [Digital Twin Simulations Toolbox of the Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18759)
*Lucas Tsunaki,Anmol Singh,Sergei Trofimov,Boris Naydenov*

Main category: quant-ph

Conclusion: 该数字孪生模型为NV自旋动力学提供了详细且易用的数值模拟工具，适用范围广泛。

Abstract: Color centers defects in solids, and particularly the nitrogen-vacancy (NV)
center in diamond, are crucial physical platforms for quantum technology
applications. Therefore, a precise and rigorous numerical modeling of the NV
system is indispensable for the continued advancement of the field. Within this
context, this work develops a Python software for simulating the NV spin
dynamics in pulsed sequences under general experimental conditions, i.e. a
digital twin. The library accounts for electromagnetic pulses and other
environmental inputs, which are used to solve the system's time-evolution
dynamics, resulting in a physical output in the form of a quantum mechanical
observable given by the fluorescence. The simulations framework is based on a
non-perturbative time-dependent Hamiltonian model, solved in the laboratory
frame. Whereby eliminating oversimplifications such as the assumption of
instantaneous $\delta$-pulses and rotating wave approximations, our simulations
reveal subtle dynamics from the realistic pulse constraints that impact quantum
systems. Three use-case examples illustrate the use of the software and
validate it by comparing the simulation results with well-established
experimental works, relevant to the fields of quantum computing (two-qubit
conditional logic gates), sensing (noise resilient dynamical decoupling
sequences between NV and couples spins) and networks (teleportation of a
quantum state between entangled NVs). Overall, this digital twin delivers a
robust and detailed numerical modeling of the NV spin dynamics, with simple and
accessible usability, for an extensive application range.

Abstract: The existence of infinite families of $N \times N$ Jacobi matrices
representing the Hamiltonians of quantum spin chains with and without early
state exclusion (ESE) has been shown to exist for any even $N \geq 4$. However,
their existence for odd $N \geq 7$ has remained an open problem. In Section 3,
we consider a chain of qubits experiencing nearest-neighbor interactions with
environmental effects and present infinite families of $7 \times 7$ Jacobi
matrices with and without ESE.

### [11] [Unconditional Pseudorandomness against Shallow Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18796)
*Soumik Ghosh,Sathyawageeswar Subramanian,Wei Zhan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文首次提出了无条件安全的量子伪随机构造，适用于浅层量子电路类，并证明了量子态2-design和随机相位子空间态的伪随机性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 研究展示了在受限敌手类中无条件实现量子伪随机性的可能性，为量子复杂性理论开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Quantum computational pseudorandomness has emerged as a fundamental notion
that spans connections to complexity theory, cryptography and fundamental
physics. However, all known constructions of efficient quantum-secure
pseudorandom objects rely on complexity theoretic assumptions.
  In this work, we establish the first unconditionally secure efficient
pseudorandom constructions against shallow-depth quantum circuit classes. We
prove that:
  $\bullet$ Any quantum state 2-design yields unconditional pseudorandomness
against both $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with arbitrarily many ancillae and
$\mathsf{AC}^0\circ\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with nearly linear ancillae.
  $\bullet$ Random phased subspace states, where the phases are picked using a
4-wise independent function, are unconditionally pseudoentangled against the
above circuit classes.
  $\bullet$ Any unitary 2-design yields unconditionally secure parallel-query
pseudorandom unitaries against geometrically local $\mathsf{QNC}^0$
adversaries, even with limited $\mathsf{AC}^0$ postprocessing.
  Our indistinguishability results for 2-designs stand in stark contrast to the
standard setting of quantum pseudorandomness against $\mathsf{BQP}$ circuits,
wherein they can be distinguishable from Haar random ensembles using more than
two copies or queries. Our work demonstrates that quantum computational
pseudorandomness can be achieved unconditionally for natural classes of
restricted adversaries, opening new directions in quantum complexity theory.

### [12] [Co-optimization of codon usage and mRNA secondary structure using quantum computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18817)
*Dimitris Alevras,Mihir Metkar,Triet Friedhoff,Jae-Eun Park,Mariana LaDue,Vaibhaw Kumar,Wade Davis,Alexey Galda*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种同时优化mRNA序列的密码子使用和二级结构的新方法，采用混合量子-经典计算策略，并在IBM量子处理器上验证了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mRNA序列的密码子优化和二级结构优化对稳定性和疗效至关重要，但两者相互影响，需要一种同时优化的方法。

Method: 引入了一种变分框架，通过双目标函数平衡密码子适应指数（CAI）和最小自由能（MFE），并采用混合量子-经典计算策略。

Result: 在IBM的127量子比特Eagle处理器上验证了方法的可行性，并在30个核苷酸的序列上进行了实验验证。

Conclusion: 该框架有望加速mRNA治疗和研究应用的优化设计。

Abstract: Co-optimizing mRNA sequences for both codon optimality and secondary
structure is crucial for producing stable and efficacious mRNA therapeutics.
Codon optimization, which adjusts nucleotide sequences to enhance translational
efficiency, inherently influences mRNA secondary structure - a key determinant
of molecular stability both in-vial and in-cell. Because both properties are
governed by the same underlying sequence, optimizing one directly impacts the
other. To address this interdependence, we introduce a novel variational
framework that simultaneously optimizes codon usage and secondary structure.
Our method employs a dual-objective function that balances the codon adaptation
index (CAI) and minimum free energy (MFE), incorporating variational parameters
for codon selection. Leveraging a hybrid quantum-classical computational
strategy and building on prior advancements in quantum algorithms for secondary
structure prediction, we effectively navigate this complex optimization space.
We demonstrate the feasibility of executing this end-to-end workflow on real
quantum hardware, using IBM's 127-qubit Eagle processor. We validate our
approach through both simulations and quantum hardware experiments on sequences
of up to 30 nucleotides. These results highlight the potential of our framework
to accelerate the design of optimal mRNA constructs for therapeutic and
research applications.

Conclusion: 该框架为实验与量子硬件之间的反馈循环提供了支持，为设计可调谐磁性态提供了新途径。

Abstract: We investigate a hybrid modeling framework in which a quantum annealer is
used to simulate magnetic interactions in molecular qubit lattices inspired by
experimentally realizable systems. Using phthalocyanine assemblies as a
structurally constrained prototype, we model a continuous deformation from a
Lieb to a kagome lattice, revealing frustration-driven disorder and magnetic
field-induced reordering in the spin structure. The annealer provides access to
observables such as the static structure factor and magnetization over a wide
parameter space, enabling the characterization of magnetic arrangements beyond
the reach of current molecular architectures. This surrogate modeling approach
supports a feedback loop between experiment and programmable quantum hardware,
offering a pathway to explore and iteratively design tunable magnetic states in
synthetic quantum materials. The synthetic design, structural characterization,
and quantum simulation framework established here defines a modular and
scalable paradigm for probing the limits of engineered quantum matter across
chemistry, condensed matter, and quantum information science.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 文章指出对量子粒子在经典禁区的速度测量实验的解读是错误的，正确的分析表明其与量子理论预测一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 澄清对量子粒子速度测量实验的错误解读，并证明其与波姆力学和量子理论的一致性。

Method: 从导波理论的角度对实验系统进行正确分析。

Result: 实验测得的速度是虚构的，实际分布与量子理论一致。

Conclusion: 实验并未挑战波姆力学，其解读需基于正确的理论框架。

Abstract: A recent article claims to measure the speed of quantum particles in the
classically forbidden regime where the energy of the particles is lower than
the local potential, and further claims that the results of this experiment
challenge Bohmian mechanics. But this interpretation of the experiment is
incorrect (and dubious even in the context of ordinary quantum mechanics). A
proper analysis of the system from a pilot-wave perspective shows that it
predicts the same distribution of particle positions (and so the same
experimental results) as ordinary quantum theory. The speed measured by the
experiment in this regime is fictitious.

### [15] [Exploring Entanglement and Parameter Sensitivity in QAOA through Quantum Fisher Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18844)
*Brian García Sarmina,Jorge Saavedra Benavides,Guo-Hua Sun,Shi-Hai Dong*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文通过量子Fisher信息（QFI）分析量子近似优化算法（QAOA）在Max-Cut问题中的表现，提出了一种基于QFI的启发式方法QIm，提高了算法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究QFI如何量化量子态对参数变化的敏感性，并探索其在QAOA中的应用潜力。

Method: 对4-10个量子比特的环状和完全图进行QFI分析，比较两种混频器家族（RX-only和RX-RY）以及不同纠缠模式的效果。

Result: 完全图的QFI特征值高于环状图，但未达到海森堡极限；纠缠层主要重新分配QFI，增加参数间相关性。提出的QIm方法在实验中表现优于基线。

Conclusion: QFI可作为QAOA等变分量子算法的轻量级、问题感知预处理器，QIm方法展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) can be used to quantify how sensitive a
quantum state reacts to changes in its variational parameters, making it a
natural diagnostic for algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA). We perform a systematic QFI analysis of QAOA for Max-Cut on
cyclic and complete graphs with $N = 4 - 10$ qubits. Two mixer families are
studied, RX-only and hybrid RX-RY, with depths $p = 2, 4, 6$ and $p = 3, 6, 9$,
respectively, and with up to three entanglement stages implemented through
cyclic- or complete-entangling patterns. Complete graphs consistently yield
larger QFI eigenvalues than cyclic graphs; none of the settings reaches the
Heisenberg limit ($4N^2$), but several exceed the linear bound ($4N$).
Introducing entanglement primarily redistributes QFI from diagonal to
off-diagonal entries: non-entangled circuits maximize per-parameter (diagonal)
sensitivity, whereas entangling layers increase the covariance fraction and
thus cross-parameter correlations, with diminishing returns beyond the first
stage. Leveraging these observations, we propose, as a proof of concept, a
QFI-Informed Mutation (QIm) heuristic that sets mutation probabilities and step
sizes from the normalized diagonal QFI. On 7- and 10-qubit instances, QIm
attains higher mean energies and lower variance than equal-probability and
random-restart baselines over 100 runs, underscoring QFI as a lightweight,
problem-aware preconditioner for QAOA and other variational quantum algorithms.

Conclusion: 优化后的自旋链显著降低了对传输时间的敏感性，为量子态传输和叠加态生成提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: When studying the perfect transfer of a quantum state from one site to
another, it is typically assumed that one can receive the arriving state at a
specific instant in time, with perfect accuracy. Here, we study how sensitive
perfect state transfer is to that timing. We design engineered spin chains
which reduce their sensitivity, proving that this construction is
asymptotically optimal. The same construction is applied to the task of
creating superpositions, also known as fractional revival.

*Haiyue Kang,Younghun Kim,Eromanga Adermann,Martin Sevior,Muhammad Usman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出部分量子纠错（QEC）方法，用于量子机器学习（QML），以减少资源开销并保持模型可训练性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子处理器中的错误导致量子机器学习模型在噪声环境中难以训练且性能下降，而完全量子纠错的高开销使其在近期难以实现。

Method: 通过假设纠错的双量子比特CNOT门（Clifford操作），省略部分蒸馏步骤以减少开销，分析不同噪声模型下的模型表现。

Result: 在单量子比特门噪声约为0.2%时，QML模型仍可训练；某些噪声模型（如热阻尼）甚至能提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 部分QEC为噪声环境中的QML提供了一种资源高效且可训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Errors in the current generation of quantum processors pose a significant
challenge towards practical-scale implementations of quantum machine learning
(QML) as they lead to trainability issues arising from noise-induced barren
plateaus, as well as performance degradations due to the noise accumulation in
deep circuits even when QML models are free from barren plateaus. Quantum error
correction (QEC) protocols are being developed to overcome hardware noise, but
their extremely high spacetime overheads, mainly due to magic state
distillation, make them infeasible for near-term practical implementation. This
work proposes the idea of partial quantum error correction (QEC) for quantum
machine learning (QML) models and identifies a sweet spot where distillations
are omitted to significantly reduce overhead. By assuming error-corrected
two-qubit CNOTs (Clifford operations), we demonstrate that the QML models
remain trainable even when single-qubit gates are subjected to $\approx0.2\%$
depolarizing noise, corresponding to a gate error rate of $\approx0.13\%$ under
randomized benchmarking. Further analysis based on various noise models, such
as phase-damping and thermal-dissipation channels at low temperature, indicates
that the QML models are trainable independent of the mean angle of
over-rotation, or can even be improved by thermal damping that purifies a
quantum state away from depolarizations. While it may take several years to
build quantum processors capable of fully fault-tolerant QML, our work proposes
a resource-efficient solution for trainable and high-accuracy QML
implementations in noisy environments.

Motivation: 解决多尺度线性输运方程的模拟问题，结合Schrödingerization方法和指数积分器，以高效处理含刚性项的多尺度问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we present two Hamiltonian simulation algorithms for
multiscale linear transport equations, combining the Schr\"odingerization
method [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett, 133 (2024), 230602][S. Jin,
N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603] and exponential integrator
while incorporating incoming boundary conditions. These two algorithms each
have advantages in terms of design easiness and scalability, and the query
complexity of both algorithms, $\mathcal{O}(N_vN_x^2\log N_x)$, outperforms
existing quantum and classical algorithms for solving this equation. In terms
of the theoretical framework, these are the first quantum Hamiltonian
simulation algorithms for multiscale linear transport equation to combine the
Schr\"odingerization method with an effective asymptotic-preserving schemes,
which are efficient for handling multiscale problems with stiff terms.

*Peng Zhao,Peng Xu,Zheng-Yuan Xue*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Fluxonium架构通过可调谐等离子体相互作用实现可扩展的多量子比特门，展示了其在量子计算中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluxonium因其强非谐性和高相干性成为有前景的量子比特候选，但实现高保真度可扩展纠缠门仍具挑战。

Method: 通过驱动量子比特状态选择性跃迁到非计算流形，实现$(C^{\otimes N})Z$门（$N\geq 2$）。

Result: 案例研究表明，CCZ、CCCZ和CCCCZ门的误差约为0.01（0.001），门长分别为50（100）ns、100（250）ns和150（300）ns。

Conclusion: Fluxonium架构通过快速、高保真度的原生多量子比特门，展示了其在可扩展量子计算中的潜力。

Abstract: Fluxoniums have emerged as a compelling qubit modality for superconducting
quantum computing, owing to their strong anharmonicity and high coherence.
However, it remains to be seen whether the implementation of high-fidelity
entangling gates in a scalable manner will be achieved or not for fluxoniums.
Here, we show that fluxonium architectures with tunable plasmon interactions
have the capability to implement scalable multi-qubit gates natively while
remaining compatible with existing single- and two-qubit gate realizations.
Within the architecture, even though qubit states are decoupled, engineered
interactions in noncomputational manifolds can facilitate the realization of
$(C^{\otimes N})Z$ gates (for $N\geq 2$). This is accomplished by driving
qubit-state selective transitions into noncomputational manifolds. Our case
studies show that CCZ, CCCZ, and CCCCZ gates with errors of approximately 0.01
(0.001) are achievable, with gate lengths of $50\,(100)\,\text{ns}$,
$100\,(250)\,\text{ns}$, and $150\,(300)\,\text{ns}$, respectively. These
results underscore the potential of the fluxonium architecture for scalable
quantum computation through fast, high-fidelity native multi-qubit gates.

Motivation: 由于理论和实验的限制，精确$k$-均匀态在实际中不可行，因此研究近似态具有重要意义。

Method: 利用Haar随机系综和浅层随机量子电路构造近似$k$-均匀态，并分析其与近似量子纠错码的关系。

Result: 近似$k$-均匀态可通过随机方法高效构造，且与高性能量子纠错码相关。

Conclusion: 研究为$k$-均匀态的实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: $k$-Uniform states are fundamental to quantum information and computing, with
applications in multipartite entanglement and quantum error-correcting codes
(QECCs). Prior work has primarily focused on constructing exact $k$-uniform
states or proving their nonexistence. However, due to inevitable theoretical
approximations and experimental imperfections, generating exact $k$-uniform
states is neither feasible nor necessary in practice. In this work, we initiate
the study of approximate $k$-uniform states, demonstrating that they are
locally indistinguishable from their exact counterparts unless massive
measurements are performed. We prove that such states can be constructed with
high probability from the Haar-random ensemble and, more efficiently, via
shallow random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we establish a connection between
approximate $k$-uniform states and approximate QECCs, showing that Haar random
constructions yield high-performance codes with linear rates, vanishing
proximity, and exponentially small failure probability while random circuits
can't construct codes with linear code rate in shallow depth. Finally, we
investigate the relationship between approximate QECCs and approximate quantum
information masking. Our work lays the foundation for the practical application
of $k$-uniform states.

Motivation: 量子硬件技术的多样性导致选择最佳执行平台变得复杂且计算成本高昂，需要一种更高效的方法。

Result: 在498个量子电路上的实验显示，模型预测准确率达94.4%，少数类F1分数为85.5%。

Conclusion: GNN方法显著加速了硬件选择过程，并保持了高准确性，为量子计算提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The growing variety of quantum hardware technologies, each with unique
peculiarities such as connectivity and native gate sets, creates challenges
when selecting the best platform for executing a specific quantum circuit. This
selection process usually involves a brute-force approach: compiling the
circuit on various devices and evaluating performance based on factors such as
circuit depth and gate fidelity. However, this method is computationally
expensive and does not scale well as the number of available quantum processors
increases. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
predictor that automates hardware selection by analyzing the Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) representation of a quantum circuit. Our study evaluates 498
quantum circuits (up to 27 qubits) from the MQT Bench dataset, compiled using
Qiskit on four devices: three superconducting quantum processors (IBM-Kyiv,
IBM-Brisbane, IBM-Sherbrooke) and one trapped-ion processor (IONQ-Forte).
Performance is estimated using a metric that integrates circuit depth and gate
fidelity, resulting in a dataset where 93 circuits are optimally compiled on
the trapped-ion device, while the remaining circuits prefer superconducting
platforms. By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids
extracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it
as a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making
process and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4%
accuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting
the best compilation target. The developed code is publicly available on GitHub
(https://github.com/antotu/GNN-Model-Quantum-Predictor).

Motivation: 解决量子力学中隧穿时间定义的争议，传统方法无法明确粒子在空间区域内的停留时间。

Method: 使用可调马赫-曾德尔干涉仪（MZI）替代传统势垒，通过干涉仪模拟隧穿现象，分析波包的传输时间。

Result: 不确定性原理限制了时间组合的定义，无法通过干涉仪两臂的时间组合得到有意义的结果；否定了超光速或负时间的假设。

Conclusion: 隧穿现象中的传输波包源于自由态的多重延迟干涉，无需引入超光速或负时间的概念。

Abstract: Controversy surrounding the "tunnelling time problem" stems from the seeming
inability of quantum mechanics to provide, in the usual way, a definition of
the duration a particle is supposed to spend in a given region of space. For
this reason, the problem is often approached from an "operational" angle. One
such approach uses the position of the transmitted wave packet in order to
infer the duration the particle spends in the barrier. Here we replace the
barrier with a tuneable Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). With this analogy
one is able, at least in principle, to achieve any advance or delay of the wave
packet sent to the chosen outgoing port. The Uncertainty Principle prevents one
from combining the durations spent in each arm the MZI into a meaningful
duration when both arms are engaged. There is no justification for invoking
"superluminal" or "negative" times, since the particle is able to arrive at the
same position (and with a higher probability) if the same initial state
propagates through only one arm of the MZI. The same is true, we argue, in the
case of tunnelling,
  where the transmitted wave packet results from destructive interference
between multiple copies of the free state, delayed relative to the free
propagation

Motivation: 当前NISQ硬件的量子比特连接性有限，需要探索高效生成GHZ态的方法。

Method: 提出基于测量的协议，并与基于酉操作的协议进行对比，实验在IBM Eagle r3芯片上实现。

Result: 基于酉操作的协议在当前NISQ架构中表现更好，而基于测量的协议在未来可能更具优势。

Conclusion: 两种方法都能有效利用设备拓扑结构，未来随着设备改进，基于测量的协议可能更优。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on GHZ state generation under the practical constraint
of limited qubit connectivity, a hallmark of current NISQ hardware. We study
the GHZ state preparation across different connectivity graphs inspired by IBM
and Google chip architectures, as well as random graphs that reflect
distributed quantum systems. Our approach is a measurement-based protocol
designed to utilize qubit connectivity constraints for the generation of GHZ
states on NISQ devices. We benchmark this against a tailored version of
state-of-the-art unitary-based protocols, also incorporating physical
connectivity limitations. To evaluate the performance of the protocols under
realistic conditions, we conducted implementations on the IBM Eagle r3 chip.
Additionally, to explore near-term scalability, we performed simulations across
a range of graph sizes and connectivity configurations, assessing performance
based on circuit depth, the number of two-qubit gates, and measurement
overhead. We observe a trade-off between the two protocols across different
figures of merit. For current state-of-the-art NISQ architectures, the
unitary-based protocol is more suitable, as it avoids mid-circuit measurements
and classical feedforward. However, the measurement-based protocol is expected
to become more advantageous in the future with more error-resilient quantum
devices, owing to its reduced circuit depth and consequently shorter execution
times. In both settings, our proposed method provides an efficient means of
leveraging the topology of qubit connections available on a given device.

Conclusion: 推广的QED-CC方法能有效描述非偏振腔中的光-物质强耦合系统，揭示了复杂的激发态行为。

Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the quantum electrodynamic coupled cluster
(QED-CC)wave function ansatz, to describe the strongly coupled light-matter
system in an unpolarized optical Fabry-P\'erot cavity. This is achieved by
explicitly treating two cavity modes in our calculation with perpendicular
polarizations and demonstrate that this ansatz preserves the symmetry of an
unpolarized cavity. Furthermore, exploiting point-group symmetry enables the
assignment of polaritonic excited states as well as their targeted calculation.
Using our implementation, the aromatic species benzene, fluorobenzene and
azulene are investigated. We demonstrate that molecules in unpolarized cavities
have a complicated excited-state landscapes with a plethora of
avoided-crossings. We compare the results for a cavity with a single
polarization to those of an unpolarized cavity described by two perpendicular
polarization vectors using the excited states of the H$_2$ molecule as an
example.

Conclusion: VQE是研究Z2 LGT的有前景工具，可能推广到其他规范群，同时避免了贫瘠高原问题。

Abstract: In this work, we design a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) suitable for
investigating ground states and static string breaking in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
lattice gauge theory (LGT). We consider a two-leg ladder lattice coupled to
Kogut-Susskind staggered fermions and verify the results of the VQE simulations
using tensor network methods. We find that for varying Hamiltonian parameter
regimes and in the presence of external charges, the VQE is able to arrive at
the gauge-invariant ground state without explicitly enforcing gauge invariance
through penalty terms. Additionally, experiments showing string breaking are
performed on IBM's quantum platform. Thus, VQEs are seen to be a promising tool
for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs, and could pave the way for studies of other gauge
groups. We find that the scaling of gradients with the number of qubits is
favorable for avoiding barren plateaus. At the same time, it is not clear how
to efficiently simulate the LGT using classical methods. Furthermore,
strategies that avoid barren plateaus arise naturally as features of LGTs, such
as choosing the initialization by setting the Gauss law sector and restricting
the Hilbert space to the gauge-invariant subspace.

Abstract: The analysis of credit risk is crucial for the efficient operation of
financial institutions. Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers the potential
for a quadratic speed-up over classical methods used to estimate metrics such
as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). However, numerous
limitations remain in efficiently scaling the implementation of quantum
circuits that solve these estimation problems. One of the main challenges is
the use of costly and restrictive arithmetic that must be implemented within
the quantum circuit. In this paper, we propose using Quantum Singular Value
Transformation (QSVT) to significantly reduce the cost of implementing the
state preparation operator, which underlies QAE for credit risk analysis. We
also present an end-to-end code implementation and the results of a simulation
study to validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its benefits.

Abstract: Quantum computers are often treated as experimental add-ons that are loosely
coupled to classical infrastructure through high-level interpreted languages
and cloud-like orchestration. However, future deployments in both,
high-performance computing (HPC) and embedded environments, will demand tighter
integration for lower latencies, stronger determinism, and architectural
consistency, as well as to implement error correction and other tasks that
require tight quantum-classical interaction as generically as possible.
  We propose a vertically integrated quantum systems architecture that treats
quantum accelerators and processing units as peripheral system components. A
central element is the Quantum Abstraction Layer (QAL) at operating system
kernel level. It aims at real-time, low-latency, and high-throughput
interaction between quantum and classical resources, as well as robust
low-level quantum operations scheduling and generic resource management. It can
serve as blueprint for orchestration of low-level computational components
"around" a QPU (and inside a quantum computer), and across different
modalities.
  We present first results towards such an integrated architecture, including a
virtual QPU model based on QEMU. The architecture is validated through
functional emulation on three base architectures (x86_64, ARM64, and RISC-V),
and timing-accurate FPGA-based simulations. This allows for a realistic
evaluation of hybrid system performance and quantum advantage scenarios. Our
work lays the ground for a system-level co-design methodology tailored for the
next generation of quantum-classical computing.

Abstract: Resource-efficient, low-depth implementations of quantum circuits remain a
promising strategy for achieving reliable and scalable computation on quantum
hardware, as they reduce gate resources and limit the accumulation of noisy
operations. Here, we propose a low-depth implementation of a class of Hadamard
test circuits, complemented by the development of a parameterized quantum
ansatz specifically tailored for variational algorithms that exploit the
underlying Hadamard test framework. Our findings demonstrate a significant
reduction in single- and two-qubit gate counts, suggesting a reliable circuit
architecture for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Building on
this foundation, we tested our low-depth scheme to investigate the expressive
capacity of the proposed parameterized ansatz in simulating nonlinear Burgers'
dynamics. The resulting variational quantum states faithfully capture the
shockwave feature of the turbulent regime and maintain high overlaps with
classical benchmarks, underscoring the practical effectiveness of our
framework. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of hardware noise by modeling
the error properties of real quantum processors and by executing the
variational algorithm on a trapped-ion-based IBEX Q1 device. The outcomes of
our demonstrations highlight the resilience of our low-depth scheme in the
turbulent regime, consistently preparing high-fidelity variational states that
exhibit strong agreement with classical benchmarks. Our work contributes to the
advancement of resource-efficient strategies for quantum computation, offering
a robust framework for tackling a range of computationally intensive problems
across numerous applications.

Abstract: Establishing a notion of the quantum state that applies consistently across
space and time is a crucial step toward formulating a relativistic quantum
theory. We give an operational meaning to multipartite quantum states over
arbitrary regions in spacetime through the causally agnostic measurement, the
measurement scheme that can be consistently implemented independently of the
causal relation between the regions. We prove that such measurements can always
be implemented with interferometry, wherein the conventional density operator,
the recently developed quantum state over time (QSOT), and the process matrix
formalisms smoothly merge. This framework allows for a systematic study of
mixed states in the temporal setting, which turn out to be crucial for modeling
quantum non-Markovianity. Based on this, we demonstrate that two different
ensembles of quantum dynamics can be represented by the same QSOT, indicating
that they cannot be distinguished through interferometry. Moreover, our
formalism reveals a new type of spatiotemporal correlation between two quantum
dynamics that originates from synchronized propagation in time under
time-reversal symmetry. We show that quantum systems with such correlation can
be utilized as a reference frame to distinguish certain dynamics
indistinguishable under time-reversal symmetry.

TL;DR: 本文分析了转移张量方法（TTM）的离散化结构，澄清了初始时间修正的来源，并验证了TTM与连续时间NZ-QME核的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Makri对TTM离散化一致性的质疑，特别是初始时间修正的问题，本文旨在澄清TTM的离散化结构并验证其一致性。

Method: 通过详细分析TTM的离散化结构，建立TTM离散时间记忆核与连续时间NZ-QME核的关系，并利用自旋-玻色模型进行数值验证。

Result: 数值结果表明，TTM提供了一致的离散化方案，记忆核和动力学演化在Δt→0时收敛。

Conclusion: TTM是一种一致的离散化方法，但其他方案（如Makri提出的中点导数/积分方案）也值得进一步研究。

Abstract: The transfer tensor method (TTM) [Cerrillo and Cao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2014,
112, 110401] can be considered a discrete-time formulation of the
Nakajima-Zwanzig quantum master equation (NZ-QME) for modeling non-Markovian
quantum dynamics. A recent paper [Makri, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21,
5037] raised concerns regarding the consistency of the TTM discretization,
particularly a spurious term at the initial time \( t=0 \). This Communication
presents a detailed analysis of the discretization structure of TTM, clarifying
the origin of the initial-time correction and establishing a consistent
relationship between the TTM discrete-time memory kernel \( K_N \), and the
continuous-time NZ-QME kernel \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \). This relationship
is validated numerically using the spin-boson model, demonstrating convergence
of reconstructed memory kernels and accurate dynamical evolution as \( \Delta t
\to 0 \). While TTM provides a consistent discretization, we note that
alternative schemes are also viable, such as the midpoint derivative/midpoint
integral scheme proposed in Makri's work. The relative performance of various
schemes for either computing accurate \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t) \) from exact
dynamics, or obtaining accurate dynamics from exact \( \mathcal{K}(N\Delta t)
\), warrants further investigation.

Result: 算法在演化时间和精度上优于现有方法，复杂度与最先进算法相当。

Conclusion: 时间依赖哈密顿模拟可以在更简单的框架下高效实现，为模拟时间依赖系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept quantum algorithm for simulating
time-dependent Hamiltonian evolution by reducing the problem to simulating a
time-independent Hamiltonian in a larger space using a discrete clock
Hamiltonian construction. A similar construction was first explored for this
simulation problem by Watkins, Wiebe, Roggero, and Lee [PRX Quantum, 2024]. Our
algorithm improves upon their work in terms of the dependence on evolution time
and precision. In addition, the complexity matches the state-of-the-art
simulation algorithms using other approaches. To achieve this improvement, we
use Duhamel's principle to treat the clock and system Hamiltonians separately
and exploit properties of Gaussian quadrature to reduce the simulation cost.
Our approach demonstrates that time-dependent Hamiltonian simulation can be as
efficient in a simpler framework and hence provides a new angle to model and
simulate time-dependent systems.

Conclusion: 噪声不仅能驱动退相干，还能通过对称性过滤选择性保护相干性，为量子传感和复杂环境中的长寿命相干性提供了新视角。

Abstract: We present a concise review and perspective on noise-induced synchronization
and coherence protection in open quantum systems, with emphasis on recent work
involving coupled spins, oscillators, and anyons. When local environments
exhibit internal correlations, the structure of the noise determines which
collective modes become decoherence-protected. This leads to steady-state
entanglement, phase locking, and exceptional points (EPs) in the Liouvillian
spectrum, signaling a collapse of the mode basis and the emergence of
non-dissipative stabilized dynamics. Using a Lindblad framework, we show that
symmetry in the noise correlations acts as a control parameter, protecting
symmetric or antisymmetric modes depending on the sign of the correlation. In
the pure-dephasing limit, coherence decay mirrors the Anderson-Kubo model,
where the effective fluctuation strength scales as $\sigma^2(1 \pm \xi)$, and
the dynamical regime (Gaussian vs. Lorentzian) is set by the ratio \( \sigma /
\gamma \). Thus, the environment not only drives decoherence but can also
selectively suppress it through symmetry filtering. We also revisit historical
and conceptual origins of this idea, beginning with Huygens synchronized
pendulum clocks and culminating in modern non-Hermitian dynamics. Correlated
noise-though classically stochastic-can organize quantum dynamics and protect
coherence without direct control over the system. These insights offer a
unifying view of synchronization in classical and quantum regimes, with
implications for quantum sensing, engineered decoherence, and long-lived
coherence in complex environments such as biological light-harvesting complexes
or avian magnetoreception.

Abstract: Modelling and predicting protein configurations is crucial for advancing drug
discovery, enabling the design of treatments for life-threatening diseases. A
critical aspect of this challenge is rotamer optimisation - the determination
of optimal side-chain conformations given a fixed protein backbone. This
problem, involving the internal degrees of freedom of amino acid side-chains,
significantly influences the protein's overall structure and function. In this
work, we develop a resource-efficient optimisation algorithm to compute the
ground state energy of protein structures, with a focus on side-chain
configuration. We formulate the rotamer optimisation problem as a Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimisation problem and map it to an Ising model,
enabling efficient quantum encoding. Building on this formulation, we propose a
quantum algorithm based on the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm to
explore the conformational space and identify low-energy configurations. To
benchmark our approach, we conduct a classical study using custom-built
libraries tailored for structural characterisation and energy optimisation. Our
quantum method demonstrates a reduction in computational cost compared to
classical simulated annealing techniques, offering a scalable and promising
framework for protein structure optimisation in the quantum era.

Abstract: Multimode multiphoton states are at the center of many photonic quantum
technologies, from photonic quantum computing to quantum sensing. In this work,
we derive a procedure to generate exactly, and with a controlled number of
steps, any such state by using only multiport interferometers, photon number
resolving detectors, photon additions, and displacements. We achieve this goal
by establishing a connection between photonic quantum state engineering and the
algebraic problem of symmetric tensor decomposition. This connection allows us
to solve the problem by using corresponding results from algebraic geometry and
unveils a mechanism of photon catalysis, where photons are injected and
subsequently retrieved in measurements, to generate entanglement that cannot be
obtained through Gaussian operations. We also introduce a tensor decomposition,
that generalizes our method and allows to construct optimal circuits for
particular classes of states. As a benchmark, we numerically evaluate our
method and compare its performance with state-of-the art results, confirming
100% fidelity on different classes of states.

Motivation: 探索无需长距离连接或高连通性的量子纠错码设计，降低硬件复杂度。

Method: 利用iSWAP门构造电路测量稳定子，避免长距离连接。数值评估方向码在超导噪声模型下的性能。

Result: 方向码在物理错误率10^-3时，仅需25-66.67%的物理量子比特即可优于RPC。

Conclusion: 方向码为低开销容错量子计算提供了突破性设计，表明复杂硬件可能非必需。

Abstract: In this paper we construct a new family of quantum low-density parity-check
(qLDPC) codes, which we call ``Directional Codes'', that outperforms the
rotated planar code (RPC) while naturally meeting the connectivity requirements
of the widely adopted square-grid, and some even the sparser hexagonal-grid.
The key idea is to utilise the iSWAP gate -- a natural native gate for
superconducting qubits -- to construct circuits that measure the stabilisers of
these qLDPC codes without the need for any long-range connections or an
increased degree of connectivity. We numerically evaluate the performance of
directional codes, encoding four, six and twelve logical qubits, using a common
superconducting-inspired circuit-level Pauli noise model. We also compare them
to the RPC and to the bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, currently the two most
popular quantum LDPC code families. As a concrete example, directional codes
outperform RPC by achieving better QEC performance at physical error rate
$p=10^{-3}$ using only $25-66.67\%$ of the physical qubits at distance up to
$10$. Our discovery represents a breakthrough in QEC code design that suggests
complex long-range, high-connectivity hardware may not be necessary for
low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Simulating vibronic spectra is a central task in physical chemistry, offering
insight into important properties of molecules. Recently, it has been
experimentally demonstrated that photonic platforms based on Gaussian boson
sampling (GBS) are capable of performing these simulations. However, whether an
actual GBS approach is required depends on the molecule under investigation. To
develop a better understanding on the requirements for simulating vibronic
spectra, we explore connections between theoretical approximations in physical
chemistry and their photonic counterparts. Mapping these approximations into
photonics, we show that for certain molecules the GBS approach is unnecessary.
We place special emphasis on the linear coupling approximation, which in
photonics corresponds to sampling from multiple coherent states. By
implementing this approach in experiments, we demonstrate improved similarities
over previously reported GBS results for formic acid and identify the
particular attributes that a molecule must exhibit for this, and other
approximations, to be valid. These results highlight the importance in forming
deeper connections between traditional methods and photonic approaches.

Motivation: 尽管存在无隐藏和无掩蔽定理，但近似量子信息掩蔽（AQIM）提供了一种绕过这些限制的途径，但其潜力尚未充分挖掘，且构造显式近似掩蔽器仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过引入不同的AQIM概念，并利用一组性能指标量化其与精确量子信息掩蔽的偏差，研究了随机等距变换在双体和多体系统中实现AQIM的可能性。

Result: 在双体系统中，几乎所有的随机等距变换都无法实现AQIM；而在多体系统中，几乎所有的随机等距变换都能实现AQIM，且所需物理量子比特数仅线性增长。

Conclusion: AQIM是量子信息理论中的核心概念，连接了多个领域的多样化概念，并在特定条件下与近似量子纠错等价。

Abstract: Masking information into quantum correlations is a cornerstone of many
quantum information applications. While there exist the no-hiding and
no-masking theorems, approximate quantum information masking (AQIM) offers a
promising means of circumventing the constraints. Despite its potential, AQIM
still remains underexplored, and constructing explicit approximate maskers
remains a challenge. In this work, we investigate AQIM from multiple
perspectives and propose using random isometries to construct approximate
maskers. First, different notions of AQIM are introduced and we find there are
profound intrinsic connections among them. These relationships are
characterized by a set of figures of merit, which are introduced to quantify
the deviation of AQIM from exact QIM. We then explore the possibility of
realizing AQIM via random isometries in bipartite and multipartite systems. In
bipartite systems, we identify a fundamental lower bound for a key figure of
merit, implying that almost all random isometries fail to realize AQIM. This
surprising result generalizes the original no-masking theorem to the
no-random-AQIM theorem for bipartite systems. In contrast, in multipartite
systems, we show almost all random isometries can realize AQIM. Remarkably, the
number of physical qubits required to randomly mask a single logical qubit
scales only linearly. We further explore the implications of these findings. In
particular, we show that, under certain conditions, approximate quantum error
correction is equivalent to AQIM. Consequently, AQIM naturally gives rise to
approximate quantum error correction codes with constant code rates and
exponentially small correction inaccuracies. Overall, our results establish
quantum information masking as a central concept in quantum information theory,
bridging diverse notions across multiple domains.

Abstract: We study theoretically the driven-dissipative dynamics of an array of
two-level emitters, coupled to a single photonic mode, in the presence of
disorder in the resonant frequencies. We introduce the notion of subradiant
correlations in the dynamics, corresponding to the eigenstates of the
Liouvillian with a low decay rate, that can also oscillate in time. While the
usual collective subradiant states do not survive the emitter resonant
frequency fluctuations, these subradiant correlations are immune to such a type
of disorder. These long-living correlations exist in finite-size systems, when
their lifetime is parametrically longer than in the so-called Dicke time
crystal phase.

reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational
calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and

Abstract: We study within a paradigmatic model for glassy dynamics, the Barrat-M\'ezard
trap model, the effect of a nontrivial network structure in the connectivity
among traps. Sparseness of this network has recently been shown to lead to
divergences in the bulk of the spectrum of the associated master operator [1,
2]. We analyse here specifically the properties of the relaxation modes that
contribute to these spectral divergences. We characterize the statistics of the
corresponding wavefunctions and demonstrate that they are localized with
multifractal properties. The localization patterns are unrelated to the spatial
(network) topology, however, and instead fall within the recently introduced
class of statistical localization phenomena [3]. To rationalize these results
we develop an effective model that successfully explains both the spectral
divergences and the power law tails in the wavefunction entries, and provides a
clear physical picture of why the localization is statistical rather than
spatial.

Conclusion: 偶极分子凝聚体在临界密度下自发形成自束缚的二维液体层。

Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation of dipolar molecules can be achieved by shielding
loss channels with microwave fields. The microwave coupling can be approximated
by effective dipole-dipole interactions with a short-range repulsion. We study
properties and stability of these molecular Bose gases with a many-body
variational method, the hypernetted-chain Euler-Lagrange method for a wide
range of densities and repulsion strengths of the microwave shield. We find a
homogeneous gas-like phase which, however, is unstable at low density against
density waves: at a critical density, which depends on the repulsion strength,
the dipolar fluid undergoes a phase transition to a layer phase. Thus, if the
molecular condensate is expanded adiabatically by decreasing the confinement
strength, it will spontaneously form layers at the critical density. These
quasi-two-dimensional layers can be self-bound, hence form two-dimensional
liquids. By varying the microwave shield, the predicted equilibrium densities
span more than an order of magnitude.

Abstract: We quantify nonlinear interactions between coupled complex processes, when
the system is subject to noise and not all its components are measurable. Our
method is applicable even when the system cannot be continuously monitored over
time, but is rather observed only in snapshots. Having only partial information
about the local topology of the network and observations of relevant
interacting variables is sufficient to translate qualitative knowledge of
interactions into a quantitative characterization of the coupled dynamics. This
approach turns a globally intractable problem into a sequence of solvable
inference problems, to quantify complex interaction networks from incomplete
snapshots of their statistical state.

Conclusion: KZM在开放系统中形成DTC时依然适用，且普适行为与DLPO的临界点附近弛豫时间发散相关。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) holds for open systems
transitioning from a disordered phase to a discrete time crystal (DTC).
Specifically, we observe the main signatures of the KZM when the system is
quenched into a DTC, which are the characteristic power-law scaling with quench
time of the number of spatial defects and the transition delay measured from
the time at which the system crosses the critical point. We show analytically
that this universal behavior can be traced back to how systems that can be
mapped onto a dissipative linear parametric oscillator (DLPO) satisfy the
adiabatic-impulse (AI) approximation, evinced by the divergence of the
relaxation time of the DLPO near a critical point. We verify our predictions in
both the classical and quantum regimes by considering two systems: the
Sine-Gordon model, which is a paradigmatic system for emulating classical DTCs;
and the open Dicke lattice model, an array of spin-boson systems subjected to
quantum fluctuations. For both systems, the DTCs can be tuned from a
ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic order by varying the driving frequency,
thus allowing us to test the validity of KZM for arbitrary spatiotemporal

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索凝聚态物理中常见的$1/f^\alpha$功率谱（$\alpha<2$）的起源，特别是$\alpha=3/2$的情况。

Method: 采用Faughnan和Strandberg的声子瓶颈经典模型，分析两能级系统与玻色准粒子的耦合。

Result: 证明了$1/f^{3/2}$功率谱的存在，并定义了稳态下的频率依赖性磁化率，结果与实验数据一致。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了凝聚态中异常弛豫的起源，并对两能级系统的实际行为提供了新见解。

Abstract: The common observation of a `$1/f^\alpha$' power spectrum with $\alpha<2$
constitutes one of the enduring mysteries of condensed matter physics. Here it
is shown that a $1/f^{\alpha}$ power spectrum, with $\alpha = 3/2$, can arise
when an ensemble of two--level systems is coupled to a heat bath by means of a
system of Bosonic quasiparticles. The model considered is the classic model of
Faughnan and Strandberg of the phonon bottleneck, and the anomalous relaxation
is associated with an approximate non-equilibrium steady state of the phonons
maintained by slow spin relaxation. It is shown that a frequency-dependent
susceptibility can be defined in the steady state and that the prediction
$\alpha=3/2$, or the equivalent stretched exponential relaxation with exponent
$\beta = 2-\alpha = 1/2$, is consistent with existing experimental data. These
results give an insight into the origins of anomalous relaxation in condensed
matter and the practical behaviour of two-level systems.

Abstract: Voting is an important social activity for expressing public opinions. By
conceptually considering a group of voting agents to be intelligent matter, the
impact of real-time information on voting results is quantitatively studied by
an intelligent Ising model, which is formed by adding nonlinear instantaneous
feedback of the overall magnetization to the conventional Ising model. In the
new model, the interaction strength becomes a variable depending on the total
magnetization rather than a constant, which mimics the scenario that the
decision of an individual during vote influenced by the dynamically changing
polling result during the election process. Our analytical derivations along
with Mote Carlo simulations reveal that, with a positive feedback, the
intelligent Ising model exhibits phase transitions at any finite temperatures,
a feature lacked in the conventional one-dimensional Ising model. In all
dimensions, by varying the feedback strength, the system changes from going
through a second-order phase transition to going through a first-order phase
transition with increasing temperature, and the two types of phase transitions
are connected by a tricritical point. This study on the one hand demonstrates
that the intelligent matter with a nonlinear adaptive interaction can exhibit
qualitatively different phase behaviors from conventional matter, and on the
other hand shows that, during voting, even unbiased feedback may possibly
induce spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to a biased outcome where one
side of the vote becomes favored.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the $(q+1)$-state clock model on the simple cubic lattice by using
Monte Carlo simulations. In addition to the nearest neighbor coupling we
consider a next-to-next-to-nearest neighbor coupling. For a certain range of
the parameters, the phase transition of the model shares the XY universality
class. Leading corrections to scaling are studied by using finite size scaling
of dimensionless quantities, such as the Binder cumulant $U_4$. The spatial
unisotropy, which causes subleading corrections, is studied by computing the
exponential correlation length $\xi_{exp}$ in the high temperature phase for
different directions. In the case of the $q$-state clock model it turns out
that by tuning the ratio of the two coupling constants, we can eliminate either
leading or subleading corrections to scaling. These points on the critical line
are close to each other. Hence in the improved model, where leading corrections
to scaling vanish, also subleading corrections are small. By using a finite
size scaling analysis of our high statistics data we obtain $\eta=0.03816(2)$
and $y_t =1/\nu=1.48872(5)$ as estimates of the critical exponents.

Result: 该协议在能量成本和时间效率上优于其他非优化协议，并达到了单一的下限时间-能量界限。

Conclusion: 该协议实现了能量成本与搜索时间的最佳权衡，为随机重置提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Stochastic resetting is a driving mechanism that is known to minimize the
first passage time to reach a target, at the cost of energy expenditure. The
choice of the physical implementation of each resetting event determines the
tradeoff between the acceleration of the search process and its energetic cost.
Here, we present an optimal transport protocol that balances the duration and
the energetic cost of each resetting event. This protocol drives a harmonically
trapped Brownian particle between two equilibrium states within a finite time
and with minimal energetic cost. An explicit comparison with other types of
finite-time protocols further shows its specific thermodynamic properties. Its
cost is both a lower bound on the cost of unoptimized shortcut protocols and an
upper bound on the cost of optimal protocols which do not ensure final
equilibrium. When applying the optimal transport protocol to implement
stochastic resetting, a single lower time-energy bound is reached: this
protocol allows to reach the best tradeoff between energetic cost and search
time.

Abstract: The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the
possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as
well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the
SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection
between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the
SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the
localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how
one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by
careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or
spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together
they construct a chain of spin qubits. As this system is realizable
experimentally, our findings provide a novel way for manipulating and
engineering spin qubits in physical systems.

Abstract: Polarization dependence has historically seen extensive use in x-ray
spectroscopy to determine magnetic and local geometric properties, but more
broadly as a way to gain extra sensitivity to electronic structure at the level
of individual magnetic orbitals. This is often done in the context of x-ray
absorption through techniques like x-ray magnetic circular dichroism or x-ray
linear dichroism, but it has seen little application to x-ray emission. Here we
explore the information contained in the polarized emission of two 3d
transition metal systems across both core-to-core (CtC) and valence-to-core
emission (VtC) lines. We demonstrate how the Rowland circle geometry can be
used as a spectropolarimeter, and apply it to the x-ray emission spectroscopy
of spin-1/2 Cu(II) and spin-0 Ni(II) ions in LiVCuO4 and DyNiC2, respectively.
From this we explore how the polarized XES interrogates of the occupied density
of states at the valence level, either as a second order effect through Coulomb
exchange (CtC x-ray emission) or by direct transitions (VtC x-ray emission). We
find that the polarized x-ray emission can provide insights into the valence
electron orbital occupation, in much the same way that is achievable with
polarized absorption or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques.
Finally, we highlight how the individually polarized dipole emission spectra
can be extracted from a linearly independent suite of directed emission
spectra, allowing for polarized measurements at high Bragg angle with lower
experimental broadening.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental measurements of the nonlinear
longitudinal resistance of the spin-orbit coupled electron gas in the (111)
LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces under external in-plane magnetic field [G. Tuvia
\emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 146301 (2024)], we formulate a theory of
nonlinear electronic transport based on the analysis of the quantum kinetic
equation for the Wigner distribution function. Specifically, we evaluate the
magnetic field dependence of the second harmonic of the current density at
arbitrary values of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the second harmonic
increases linearly with the magnetic field at small fields. Upon further
increase of the magnetic field, the second harmonic response reaches its
maximum value. We find that the position of the peak and its width strongly
depend on the relaxation rate due to disorder. Importantly, we discover that
the direction of the nonlinear contribution to the current can be completely
reversed when the magnetic field reaches a certain critical value.

Abstract: Significant research advances have led to a consensus that the Fermi-Hubbard
model and its extended variants are archetypal frameworks for elucidating the
intertwined relationship between stripe orders and superconductivity in
hole-doped high-$T_c$ materials. Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has
recently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully
cooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable
fluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing
of electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly
understood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects
and non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation
of a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard
models with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas
microscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the
high-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the
ground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data
demonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously
pair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing
pattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we
reconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its
connection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs
enable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double
stripes. Our work offers new insights into the role of stripe orders in
mediating $d$-wave superconductivity and paves the way for further exploration
of multi-stripe-mediated pairing mechanisms in the Fermi-Hubbard model.

Abstract: Chemical bonding is key to unlocking the potential of magnetic materials for
future information technology. Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected
nano-sized spin textures that can enable high-density low-power spin-based
electronics. Despite increasing interest in the discovery of new skyrmion hosts
and their characterization, the electronic origins of the skyrmion formation
remain unknown. Here, we study GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) as a model system to
study the connection among chemical bonding, electronic instability, and the
critical temperature and magnetic field at which skyrmions evolve. The nature
of the electronic structure of GdRu2X2 is characterized by chemical bonding,
Fermi surface analysis, and density of energy function. As X-p orbitals become
more extended from Si-3p to Ge-4p and Sn-5p, improved interactions between the
Gd spins and the [Ru2X2] conduction layer and increased destabilizing energy
contributions are obtained. GdRu2Si2 possesses a Fermi surface nesting (FSN)
vector [Q = (q, 0, 0)], whereas GdRu2Ge2 displays two inequivalent FSN vectors
[Q = (q, 0, 0); QA = (q, q, 0)] and GdRu2Sn2 features multiple Q vectors. In
addition, competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions
in the Gd plane become more pronounced as a function of X. These results reveal
some correlation among the electronic instability, the competing interaction
strength, and the temperature and magnetic field conditions at which the
skyrmions emerge. This work demonstrates how chemical bonding and electronic
structure enable a new framework for understanding and developing skyrmions
under desired conditions that would otherwise be impossible.

Abstract: Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in
physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively,
the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the
information exchange between different length scales, has received far less
attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a
matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks
in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method
by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space
renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for
the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure
of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in
each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied
almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical
calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating
computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for
the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping,
where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure
precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.

Abstract: The triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ orders
antiferromagnetically in a planar 120$^\circ$-structure below
$T_\textrm{N}\approx 4$ K. A striking feature of RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ magnetic
phase diagram is the presence of collinear ``1/3-plateau'' magnetic phase,
which is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations at magnetization
$M\approx \frac{1}{3} M_\textrm{sat}$. Static disorder caused by impurities is
predicted to act against the effect of fluctuations and to suppress collinear
plateau phase (Maryasin and Zhitomirsky, PRL 111, 247201 (2013)). Balance
between ``dynamic'' thermal and quantum fluctuations and ``static''
impurity-induced disorder is temperature-sensitive, which allows thermal
fluctuations to take over the effect of static disorder and leads to the
revival of the fluctuation-stabilized ``1/3-plateau'' phase on heating. Here we
present experimental results directly confirming this prediction and
demonstrating re-establishment of the plateau-like phase in the diluted
Rb$_{(1-x)}$K$_{x}$Fe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ sample at moderate dilution level $x=15$\%
on heating as the effect of thermal fluctuations increases.

Abstract: Quantum spin chains with competing interactions offer a platform where low
dimensionality and frustration--both acting to suppress magnetic
order--intersect. We studied magnetic ordering in the spin-1/2 chain compound
AgCuVO$_4$ using muon spin spectroscopy and neutron diffraction. Long-range
magnetic order emerges at $T_N = 2.0(1)$ K, which is $\sim$1/200 of the
dominant intrachain coupling $J$ and $\sim$1/15 of the interchain interactions.
The collinear incommensurate amplitude-modulated magnetic structure features a
reduced ordered moment of 0.13(2) $\mu_\mathrm{B}$, confined to the $ab$ plane
and modulated along the $c$ axis--perpendicular to the spin chains--indicating
frustrated interchain couplings. The low $T_N$, small moment, and
incommensurate order highlight strong frustration, positioning AgCuVO$_4$ as a
model system for exploring frustration in quantum spin chains.

Abstract: Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound
states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into
magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into
the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using
high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics
simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to
tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative
comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal
substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization,
placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the
exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and
temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes:
deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and
coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom.
Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a
structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van
Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the
conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and
demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape
fractionalization and confinement.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, characterized by their ability to model open
systems with gain and loss, have unveiled striking phenomena such as the
non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates localize at boundaries
under open boundary conditions. While extensively studied in non-interacting
systems, the interplay between NHSE and strong electron correlations remains
largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the non-Hermitian Hubbard model with
asymmetric hopping, employing real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT),
a novel extension to such non-Hermitian correlated models-to capture both local
correlations and spatial inhomogeneities. By analyzing the end-to-end Green's
function as probes of directional amplification, we demonstrate that strong
correlations can suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from
boundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics. Our systematic study reveals
that correlations dominate at small to intermediate strength of asymmetric
hopping, inducing exponential decay in the end-to-end Green's function, but
higher strength of asymmetric hopping can restore amplification even at strong
interaction. These results illuminate the tunable interplay between
correlations and non-Hermitian physics, suggesting avenues for engineering
non-reciprocal transport in correlated open quantum systems.

TL;DR: 碳纳米管晶体管的性能接近甚至超越硅晶体管，但需解决制造过程中的非理想性问题，特别是亚阈值摆幅。研究发现，离散的空穴陷阱位点是导致亚阈值摆幅增大的原因，且仅靠近纳米管的陷阱位点影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管晶体管性能虽高，但亚阈值摆幅远高于理想热极限，影响能效。研究旨在揭示其成因并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过模拟分析离散空穴陷阱位点对亚阈值摆幅的影响，重点关注靠近纳米管的陷阱位点。

Result: 模拟显示，纳米管附近的陷阱位点密度约为0.5/nm²时，亚阈值摆幅显著增加，仅需移除或钝化少量位点即可改善性能。

Conclusion: 减少或钝化靠近碳纳米管的少量陷阱位点，可显著降低亚阈值摆幅，提升晶体管性能。

Abstract: Carbon nanotube transistors have been experimentally demonstrated to reach
performance comparable and even surpassing that of silicon transistors. Further
improvement requires addressing non-idealities arising from device fabrication
that impact performance and reproducibility. One performance metric that
determines energy efficiency is the subthreshold swing which is often observed
to be 3-4 times larger than the ideal thermal limit. In this work, we present
simulations indicating that a discrete number of variable occupancy hole
trapping sites can explain the large subthreshold swing. Our simulations
indicate that while three-dimensional trap distributions influence the
subthreshold swing, only the traps in close proximity to the nanotubes have a
significant impact. The results suggest that a density of trapping sites on the
order of 0.5/nm$^2$ near the nanotubes is sufficient to significantly increase
the subthreshold swing, requiring the removal or passivation of only a few
sites per carbon nanotube.

Abstract: The emergence of neutral collective modes is a hallmark of correlated quantum
phases but is often challenging to probe experimentally. In two-dimensional
flatband systems, charge responses have been intensively investigated, yet
neutral excitations remain largely unexplored. In particular, intervalley
coherent state (IVC) features a neutral Goldstone mode due to spontaneously
broken valley U(1) symmetry. While IVC state has been proposed as a unifying
theme across graphene- and semiconductor-based systems, its defining feature -
the neutral Goldstone mode - remains elusive in experiment. Here we investigate
space-and-time-resolved transport of neutral modes in twisted WSe2 moir\'e
superlattices through a novel ultrafast imaging technique. We uncover two new
propagating collective modes with very different velocities, which emerge near
the van Hove singularity (VHS) in both intermediate- (3.5~4 degree) and
large-angle (~5 degree) twisted WSe2. The fast-propagating mode has a
surprisingly large speed of ~3 km/s and is consistent with a Goldstone mode for
an IVC state, while the slow-moving mode is likely a gapped amplitude mode.
They can be understood as the spin-valley analogues of collective modes of a
superfluid, whose propagation are imaged for the first time in a condensed
matter system. Our study sets a new paradigm for probing charge-neutral modes
in quantum materials and offers key insights into the interplay between charge
and spin-valley physics in moir\'e superlattices.

TL;DR: 论文研究了反铁磁材料Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$中拓扑非共面磁序的光学探测方法，通过磁圆二色性（MCD）成像和写入手性反铁磁畴。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$的净磁化强度极小，但其表现出零磁场下的大横向霍尔电导率，源于其拓扑非共面磁序。研究旨在探索光学方法对其磁序的探测和操控。

Method: 利用紫外到红外（400-1000 nm）波长的光学测量，结合第一性原理计算，分析磁圆二色性（MCD）对拓扑反铁磁序的探测能力，并通过扫描MCD显微镜直接成像和写入手性反铁磁畴。

Conclusion: 磁圆二色性（MCD）是一种有效的工具，可用于探测和操控拓扑反铁磁序，为未来研究提供了新的光学方法。

Abstract: Despite its tiny net magnetization, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) van der Waals
material Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ exhibits a large transverse Hall conductivity
$\sigma_{xy}$ even at zero applied magnetic field, which arises, as recently
shown, from the topological nature of its non-coplanar ``tetrahedral'' AFM
order. This triple-Q magnetic order can be regarded as the short-lengthscale
limit of a magnetic skyrmion lattice, and has an intrinsic spin chirality. Here
we show, using optical wavelengths spanning the ultraviolet to infrared
(400-1000 nm), that magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) provides an incisive
optical probe of the topological AFM order in Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. Measurements
as a continuous function of photon energy are directly compared with
first-principles calculations, revealing the influence of the underlying
quantum geometry on optical conductivity. Leveraging the power and flexibility
of optical methods, we use scanning MCD microscopy to directly image chiral AFM
domains, and demonstrate writing of chiral AFM domains.

Abstract: We evaluate the real-space second Chern number of four-dimensional Chern
insulators using the kernel polynomial method. Our calculations are performed
on a four-dimensional system with $30^4$ sites, and the numerical results agree
well with theoretical expectations. Moreover, we show that the method is
capable of capturing the disorder effects. This is evidenced by the phase
diagram obtained for disordered systems, which agrees well with predictions
from the self-consistent Born approximation. Furthermore, we extend the method
to six dimensions and perform an exploratory real-space calculation of the
third Chern number. Although finite-size effects prevent full quantization, the
numerical results show qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations. The
study represents a step forward in the real-space characterization of
higher-dimensional topological phases.

Abstract: Quantum droplets are dilute self-bound configurations of bosons that result
from the balance between a mean-field attraction and a repulsion induced by
quantum fluctuations. Such droplets have been successfully realized in cold
atomic gases and represent a signature of their quantum nature. Here, we
predict the existence of a similar droplet phase in a solid-state system,
involving polaritons formed from the strong coupling between excitons (bound
electron-hole pairs) and photons in a semiconductor microcavity. We consider a
spin mixture of exciton-polaritons near a biexciton Feshbach resonance, which
allows one to tune the interspecies interactions to be attractive and
comparable in magnitude to the intraspecies repulsion. We find that self-bound
quantum droplets are achievable for realistic parameters in atomically thin
semiconductors, and that they can be detected via their excitation spectrum and
spatial profile. This exotic phase could potentially lead to polariton
condensation at lower thresholds and it opens an alternative avenue to achieve
the long-sought quantum polaritonic regime.

Abstract: Transmission and processing of information at the nanoscale using spin waves
and their quanta - magnons, offers numerous advantages and opportunities that
make it a promising next-generation technology for integrated electronics. The
main challenges that still need to be addressed to ensure high competitiveness
of magnonic devices include finding ways to efficiently amplify spin waves in
nanostructures and developing nanocircuits that can operate without the need
for an external bias magnetic field. Here we demonstrate how these two
challenges can be solved using nano-waveguides fabricated from a low-loss
magnetic insulator. We show that by using local parametric pumping with a power
of only a few milliwatts, one can achieve coherent amplification of spin-wave
pulses by more than two orders of magnitude at zero bias magnetic field. Our
results provide a simple solution to problems that have long prevented the
implementation of efficient integrated magnonic circuits.

Abstract: Sensing quantum superpositions of a magnonic mode has been accomplished using
a superconducting qubit by realizing an effective dispersive interaction
between the two systems. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that a seemingly
classical bosonic mode can be utilized as a probe for sensing quantum
superpositions of a magnon mode, while outperforming a qubit in various regards
as the sensor. Considering another magnon mode in an antiferromagnet as the
probe mode, we delineate the required dispersive coupling emerging directly
from antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. When a phonon is used as the probe
mode, we derive the effective dispersive coupling emerging from the
lowest-order nonlinear magnon-phonon interactions. Our two considered examples
provide the general design principles for identifying and utilizing a bosonic
probe mode for sensing quantum superpositions in a physical platform of
interest.

Abstract: We investigate the topological phenomenon of Dirac point annihilation and its
obstruction in three-band, real symmetric Hamiltonians with time-reversal
symmetry, and their relation to the Euler number, a well-known topological
invariant. For this purpose, we study the example of the kagome lattice using a
simple tight-binding model. By tuning the parameters of the lattice
continuously, we illustrate situations where two Dirac points are able to
annihilate, and others, where this annihilation is topologically obstructed.
For a system with no gaps between the three bands, like in the kagome lattice,
the Euler number of two bands is ill-defined on the whole Brillouin zone, which
requires the introduction of the so-called ``patch" Euler number on a subregion
without additional degeneracies coming from the third band. A non-zero patch
Euler number means that the annihilation of the Dirac points is impossible. We
also illustrate another point of view, using homotopy theory, associating the
Dirac points with quaternionic charges. We prove that the non-abelian braiding
of the Dirac points in k-space conjugates their quaternionic charge and
explains the possible obstruction to the annihilation of Dirac points. Finally,
we show that the proposed deformation of the kagome lattice can be achieved in
realistic photonic systems.

Result: 排斥力（Pauli力）和吸引力（化学键力）的衰减常数分别为46 pm和66 pm，比自然原子的衰减长度更长。

Conclusion: 量子围栏缺乏深束缚态，导致更长的衰减长度，为设计和理解低维量子结构中的相互作用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Artificial atoms, such as quantum corrals, offer an excellent platform to
study fundamental interactions between localized quantum states and nanoscale
probes. We performed atomic force microscopy measurements inside square quantum
corrals on Cu(111) using CO- and metal-terminated tips. Using chemically
unreactive CO-terminated tips repulsive Pauli forces can be probed, while
metallic tips are attracted to the localized quantum states due to chemical
bonding. We found distinct exponential decay constants of 46 pm for the
repulsive and 66 pm for the attractive forces. Attractive and repulsive
interactions between two natural atoms show significantly shorter decay
lengths. While natural atoms feature states with a broad range of decay
lengths, including very short ones from deeply bound states, quantum corrals
are lacking such deeply bound and highly localized states, resulting in longer
decay lengths. These results offer a new route to understand and design
atomic-scale interactions in low-dimensional quantum structures and devices.
