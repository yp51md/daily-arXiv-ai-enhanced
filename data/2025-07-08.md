*Pete Rigas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文研究了量子通道上经典比特码字的比特传输速率严格上界，探讨了其在通信协议分类和抗噪纠错码构建中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明，在Alice和Bob共享的低噪声通道中，比特传输速率的下界可以成立。本文旨在通过上界分析，揭示通信协议的矛盾特性，并设计抗噪纠错码。

Method: 通过修剪过程确定字母表中可移除的字母，以最大化纠错概率并最小化误接受率，同时利用对数依赖关系推导比特传输速率的上界。

Result: 得到的比特传输速率上界依赖于玩家字母表大小的自然对数，以及更小的字母表，可用于实现量子优势。

Conclusion: 比特传输速率的上界分析为通信协议分类和抗噪纠错码设计提供了新视角，尤其在噪声较多的Alice-Bob通道中表现突出。

Abstract: We obtain strict upper bounds on the bit transmission rate for communication
of Classical bit codewords over Quantum channels. Albeit previous arguments in
arXiv: 1804.01797 which have demonstrated that lower bounds can be shown to
hold for the bit transmission rate without the presence of significant noise
over the channel shared by Alice and Bob for the purposes of encoding,
decoding, transmission and authentication, the author suggests that upper
bounding the bit transmission rate could be of use towards classifying
paradoxical aspects of communication protocols, as well as constructing error
correcting codes which are resilient to noise. The upper bound that is obtained
in this work for the bit transmission rate, as a converse result, is dependent
upon the natural logarithm of the size of each player's alphabet, as well as
smaller alphabets, which can be leveraged for simultaneously realizing Quantum
advantage for maximizing error correction and minimizing false acceptance.
Crucially, the upper bound to the bit transmission rate is dependent upon a
pruning procedure, which seeks to determine whether letters from player's
alphabets can be removed so that prospective Quantum advantage, in order for
Alice and Bob to implement error correction protocols with high probability,
despite the fact that there is more noise over the channel between Alice and
Bob in comparison to that between Bob and Eve.

Abstract: Among the fundamental quantum effects, quantum reflection (QR) is one of the
most notable phenomena. Approximating arbitrary potentials in the Schr\"odinger
equation as multistep potentials allows us to determine the reflection
coefficient by means of a Riccati equation. We introduce a measure for the
wavefunction's characteristic reflection distance and derive an analytical
expression for this reflection point in an arbitrary power-law potential. We
study the associated QR rate in the context of Casimir--Polder atom surface
interactions, revealing its strong dependence on critical parameters such as
velocity and interaction duration. As an application, we demonstrate how the
matter-wave diffraction of a low-velocity metastable Argon beam impinging on a
rotated grating facilitates high-precision potential analysis.

Abstract: Efficient stabilizer-based computation is a key task in quantum computing as
it provides a classically tractable insight into quantum algorithms, which
otherwise quickly become impossible at scale on a classical device.
Formulations in quantum error correction, hardware verification, hybrid
computing, and more, all benefit from the ability of Clifford gates to be
accurately evaluated by classical computers. However, current stabilizer
simulators have significant limitations in scaling and use-case beyond direct
simulation. To address this, we present a GPU-accelerated tableau stabilizer
simulator that scales efficiently in direct circuit simulation, and supports a
range of stabilizer-based tasks. We show how the simulator is used to quickly
calculate Pauli commutation groupings between Pauli strings to reduce the
number of circuit runs in quantum chemistry problems. We also present a
Clifford+T circuit transpiler based on STABSim, which uses the simulator
framework to track relations in non-Clifford rotations as Clifford gates are
absorbed into the measurement step of the circuit. The T rotation layers left
behind are then further optimized in the simulator structure to create a
reduced circuit containing only the minimum non-Clifford rotations, improving
the time to simulate and reducing the cost to run on real quantum devices.

### [4] [Estimating Quantum Execution Requirements for Feature Selection in Recommender Systems Using Extreme Value Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03229)

Result: 在多个量子平台（包括模拟器和物理量子处理器）上的实验表明，该方法能有效估计获取满意解所需的运行次数。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子解决方案的实用性提供了定量评估工具，有助于在实际应用中更可靠地使用量子计算。

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have significantly accelerated research
into quantum-assisted information retrieval and recommender systems,
particularly in solving feature selection problems by formulating them as
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems executable on
quantum hardware. However, while existing work primarily focuses on
effectiveness and efficiency, it often overlooks the probabilistic and noisy
nature of real-world quantum hardware. In this paper, we propose a solution
based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to quantitatively assess the usability of
quantum solutions. Specifically, given a fixed problem size, the proposed
method estimates the number of executions (shots) required on a quantum
computer to reliably obtain a high-quality solution, which is comparable to or
better than that of classical baselines on conventional computers. Experiments
conducted across multiple quantum platforms (including two simulators and two
physical quantum processors) demonstrate that our method effectively estimates
the number of required runs to obtain satisfactory solutions on two widely used
benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于量子比特的方法在图像存储中存在局限性，需要一种更高效且与光子兼容的量子存储模型。

Method: 使用相干态位移算子编码图像强度，通过delta演化机制记录帧间变化，并引入基于冯·诺依曼熵的熵索引支持可扩展检索。

Result: 在Strawberry Fields中模拟显示部分保真度保留和相干相空间行为（通过Wigner函数可视化）。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子视觉和成像应用提供了一种可扩展且光子兼容的量子存储模型。

Abstract: I propose a novel framework for quantum image storage using
continuous-variable (CV) photonic systems. Unlike traditional qubit-based
approaches, this model encodes grayscale image intensities into qumodes via
coherent-state displacement operators. A delta evolution mechanism enables
memory efficient storage by recording only intensity shifts between frames. To
support scalable retrieval, I introduce entropy based frame indexing using von
Neumann entropy. The proposed system is simulated using Strawberry Fields,
demonstrating partial fidelity preservation and coherent phase-space behavior
via Wigner function visualization. This approach offers a promising pathway

Motivation: 信息与干扰在独立测量可分离系统时通常具有加性，而传统乘性度量无法直接体现这一点。

Method: 通过对数将乘性度量（如估计和操作保真度）转化为加性度量。

Result: 加性度量在信息与干扰的权衡关系中改变了最优测量的定义。

Conclusion: 加性度量为量子测量中的信息与干扰提供了更自然的描述，并揭示了新的最优测量方法。

Abstract: Additive measures for information and disturbance in quantum measurements of
a system are defined from well-known multiplicative measures such as estimation
and operation fidelities using a logarithm. This is motivated by the fact that
information and disturbance are naturally assumed to be additive while
performing independent measurements on separable systems. Although the
additivity makes no remarkable difference when information and disturbance are
separately considered, it can change measurements that only introduce minimal
disturbance relative to the amount of information. Such optimal measurements
are shown for additive information and disturbance measures with a tradeoff
relationship.

Result: 获得了13微秒的T2*退相干时间、88微秒的Hahn-echo时间，以及超过99.9%的单量子比特门保真度。

Conclusion: 室温永磁体可实现高性能量子比特，为大规模量子处理器扩展提供了可能。

Abstract: Germanium spin qubits exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction, which allow for
high-fidelity qubit control, but also provide a strong dependence on the
magnetic field. Superconducting vector magnets are often used to minimize
dephasing due to hyperfine interactions and to maximize spin control, but these
compromise the sample space and thus challenge scalability. Here, we explore
whether a permanent magnet outside the cryostat can be used as an alternative.
Operating in a hybrid mode with an internal and external magnet, we find that
we can fine-tune the magnetic field to an in-plane orientation. We obtain a
qubit dephasing time T2*=13 microseconds, Hahn-echo times T2H=88 microseconds,
and an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity above 99.9%, from which we
conclude that room temperature magnets allow for high qubit performance.
Furthermore, we probe the qubit resonance frequency using only the external
magnet, with the internal superconducting magnet switched off. Our approach may
be used to scale semiconductor qubits and use the increased sample space for
the integration of cryogenic control circuitry and wiring to advance to
large-scale quantum processors.

Conclusion: 该研究为非平衡量子光学和非高斯光子传输提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is
an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an
analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in
atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking
advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform
perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the
three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then
compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic
ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our
formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also
isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon
correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of
the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order
electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures
emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also
calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed.
Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our
analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a
formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles
and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.

Method: 利用空间形式的Leggett-Garg不等式，分析Heisenberg链在磁场中的行为，观察不等式违反的时间与测量距离的关系。

Result: 首次不等式违反时间与测量距离成正比，且增加相互作用范围会提前违反时间。

Conclusion: 空间Leggett-Garg不等式为分析多体量子系统的非相对论动力学提供了新工具。

Abstract: We formulate a spatial extension of the Leggett-Garg inequality by
considering three distant observers locally measuring a many-body system at
three subsequent times. The spatial form, in particular, is specially suited to
analyze propagation of quantum perturbations through spin chains, by capturing
how a measurement at one site can later affect distant sites due to the
interactions. We illustrate our proposal for a Heisenberg chain in a magnetic
field, showing indeed that the first inequality-violation time scales
proportionally to the distance between measuring parties. We attribute this
phenomenon to Lieb-Robinson physics and, confirming this connection, we find
that violations are anticipated when increasing the interaction range. The
inequality violation, readily observable in current experiments, demonstrates
the incompatibility between two-point correlation functions and the
macrorealistic hypothesis. In outlook, spatial Leggett-Garg inequalities
constitute a new tool for analyzing the non-relativistic dynamics of many-body
quantum systems.

Conclusion: 该算法能有效减少缓存缺失的影响，并提出了无需纠错的误差检测策略。

Abstract: The neighbor search is a computationally demanding problem, usually both
time- and memory-consuming. The main problem of this kind of algorithms is the
long execution time due to cache misses. In this work, we propose a quantum
algorithm for the Fixed RAdius Neighbor Search problem (FRANS) based on the
fixed-point version of Grover's algorithm. We derive an efficient circuit for
solving the FRANS with linear query complexity with the number of particles
$N$. The quantum circuit returns the list of all the neighbors' pairs within
the fixed radius, together with their distance, avoiding the slow down given by
cache miss. We explicitly write the Grover's operator and analyze its gate
complexity. The whole algorithm has complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(M^{\frac{1}{2}}N^{2})$ in the worst-case scenario, where $M$ is
the number of neighboring pairs, and uses $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ number of
qubits. By employing extra ancilla qubits the depth of the circuit can be
brought down to $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ at the cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ qubits
for unstructured dataset, or $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log N))$ qubits for
structured datasets. Finally we assess the resilience of the model to the
readout error, suggesting an error correction-free strategy to check the
accuracy of the results.

Result: 发现QFI在热化瞬态中出现峰值，初始态中的局部相干性和量子关联可显著提升温度估计精度。

Conclusion: 提出了设计高精度量子传感器的初始态选择指南，并提供了实验实现的建议。

Abstract: We investigate an nonequilibrium quantum thermometry protocol in which an
ensemble of qubits, acting as temperature probes, is weakly coupled to a
macroscopic thermal bath. The temperature of the bath, the parameter of
interest, is encoded in the dissipator of a Markovian thermalization process.
For some relevant initial states, we observe a peak in the Quantum Fisher
Information (QFI) during the transient of the thermalization, indicating
enhanced sensitivity in early-time dynamics. This effect becomes more
pronounced at higher bath temperatures and is further enhanced when the qubits'
initial state has a larger ground-state population. Our analysis shows that
both local coherence in the probes' initial state and initial correlations
among the probes contribute to the amplification of the peak in the QFI, thus
improving the precision of the temperature estimation. The influence of quantum
correlations emerges as a central feature of this work. Although the dynamics
does not permit superlinear scaling of the QFI with the number of probes, we
identify the most effective initial states for designing high-precision quantum
sensors within this setting. We also provide concrete guidelines for
experimental implementations.

Conclusion: 理论预测为未来量子模拟平台上的实验提供了验证方向。

Abstract: Understanding how quasi-particles interact with impurities is crucial for
unveiling novel properties of quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is
the enhanced scattering between electrons and magnetic impurities in the
low-energy limit, which gives rise to the Kondo effect. In this letter,
motivated by recent developments in quantum simulation platforms, we
investigate the universal behavior of long-range quantum spin chains with a
single local impurity, focusing on systems that conserve the magnon number.
Using effective field theory, we show that distinct classes of universal
three-magnon states can emerge when the impurity-mediated two-magnon
interaction is on resonance. When the long-range coupling decays as
$1/r^\alpha$, we find that (i) for $\alpha\in (2,2.89)$, the system exhibits
Efimov effects, with the three-body binding energy forming a geometric series
$\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-n (\alpha-1) \pi/s_0(\alpha)$, (ii) for
$\alpha=2$, the system shows semi-super Efimov effects with
$\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-(n\pi-\theta)^2/8$. Our theoretical
prediction is validated by the numerical solution of the
Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. Our results could be tested experimentally
in the future on quantum simulation platforms.

Conclusion: 量子纠缠在参数估计中具有关键作用，其与精度的关系在不同场景下表现出普遍行为，为实验设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: It is a specific type of quantum correlated state that achieves optimal
precision in parameterestimation under unitary encoding. We consider the
potential experimental limitation on probe entanglement, and find a relation
between achievable precision and initial probe entanglement, in both bipartite
and multipartite scenarios. For two-qubit probes, we analytically derive an
exact relationship between the entanglement-constrained optimal quantum Fisher
information and the limited initial entanglement, measured via both generalized
geometric measure and entanglement entropy. We demonstrate that this
fundamental relationship persists across the same range of the entanglement
measures even when higher-dimensional bipartite probes are considered.
Furthermore, we identify the specific states that realize maximum precision in
these scenarios. Additionally, by considering the geometric measure of
entanglement, we extend our approach to multiqubit probes. We find that in
every case, the optimal quantum Fisher information exhibits a universal
behavior:a steep increase in the low-entanglement regime, followed by a gradual
and nearly-saturated improvement as the probe entanglement approaches values
close to those required for achieving the Heisenberg limit.

Abstract: The mixing of two different gases is one of the most common natural
phenomena, with applications ranging from CO$_2$ capture to water purification.
Traditionally, mixing is analyzed in the context of local thermal equilibrium,
where systems exchange energy with a heat bath. Here, we study mixing in an
isolated system with potentially non-equilibrium initial states, characterized
solely by macroscopic observables. We identify the entropy of mixing as a
special case of observational entropy within an observer-dependent framework,
where both entropy and extractable work depend on the resolution of
measurement. This approach naturally resolves the Gibbs mixing paradox in
quantum systems: while an observer experiences a discontinuous increase in
entropy upon learning of the existence of two particle types, this knowledge
does not provide an advantage in work extraction if the types of particles
remain operationally indistinguishable in their measurements. Finally, we
derive a Landauer-like bound on the difference in energy extracted by two
observers, where an "observational temperature" emerges, determined by the
accessible information. These results provide a foundation for rigorously
determining the energy required to unmix in non-equilibrium settings and extend
beyond quantum systems, offering insights into the thermodynamics of isolated
classical gases.

Conclusion: 该方法显著缩小了理论安全证明与实际QKD实现之间的差距。

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises information-theoretic security based
on quantum mechanics, but practical implementations face security
vulnerabilities due to device imperfections. Recent advances have separately
addressed source and detector imperfections in phase-error-estimation based
security proof frameworks, but this is not enough to protect real-world QKD
systems suffering from both types of imperfections simultaneously. In this
work, we show that existing techniques for BB84-type protocols can be combined
to construct a unified security proof that simultaneously accounts for both
source and detector imperfections. Our approach thus represents a significant
step towards closing the gap between theoretical security proofs and practical
QKD implementations.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning scheme in which a quantum
system is used to perform information processing. A prospective approach to its
physical realization is a photonic platform in which continuous variable (CV)
quantum information methods are applied. The simplest CV quantum states are
Gaussian states, which can be efficiently simulated classically. As such, they
provide a benchmark for the level of performance that non-Gaussian states
should surpass in order to give a quantum advantage. In this article we propose
two methods to extract more performance from Gaussian states compared to
previous protocols. We consider better utilization of the measurement
distribution by sampling its cumulative distribution function. We show it
provides memory in areas that conventional approaches are lacking, as well as
improving the overall processing capacity of the reservoir. We also consider
storing past measurement results in classical memory, and show that it improves
the memory capacity and can be used to mitigate the effects of statistical
noise due to finite measurement ensemble.

Conclusion: 该框架为实验环境下研究量子自旋动力学提供了一种可行且可扩展的途径。

Abstract: We demonstrate an experimentally feasible circuit-QED Bose-Hubbard simulator
that reproduces the complex spin dynamics of Heisenberg models. Our method
relies on mapping spin-1/2 systems onto bosonic states via the polynomially
expanded Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation. The HP transformation
translates the intricate behavior of spins into a representation that is
compatible with bosonic devices like those in a circuit QED setup. For
comparison, we also implement the Dyson-Maleev (DM) encoding for spin-1/2 and
show that, in this limit, DM and HP are equivalent. We show the equivalence of
the DM and the HP transformations for spin-1/2 systems. Rigorous numerical
analyses confirm the effectiveness of our HP-based protocol. Specifically, we
obtain the concurrence between the spin dynamics and the behavior of microwave
photons within our circuit QED-based analog simulator that is designed for the
Bose-Hubbard model. By utilizing the microwave photons inherent to circuit QED
devices, our framework presents an accessible, scalable avenue for probing
quantum spin dynamics in an experimentally viable setting.

Conclusion: 量子电路中的测量诱导相变具有丰富的动力学行为，时间对称性和随机性对相变有重要影响。

Abstract: We study measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum circuits consisting
of kicked Ising models with postselected weak measurements, whose dynamics can
be mapped onto a classical dynamical system. For a periodic (Floquet)
non-unitary evolution, such circuits are exactly tractable and admit
volume-to-area law transitions. We show that breaking time-translation symmetry
down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a
critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin.
Furthermore, for some classes of random non-unitary circuits, we demonstrate
the robustness of the volume-to-area law phase transition for arbitrary random
realizations, thanks to the emergent compactness of the classical map encoding
the circuit's dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce a method for shaping a cold atom cloud using a vortex laser beam
with a polarisation singularity at its center, which creates a point of
vanishing intensity. Exploiting this feature we experimentally demonstrate two
different schemes to create micron-scaled line- and sheet-like atomic density
distributions. In the dynamic scheme, atoms in the bright beam regions are
accelerated and therefore effectively removed from the cloud. In the dark-state
scheme, these atoms are pumped into a state that does not interact with the
shaping light. In both cases, an atomic distribution remains, either as a thin
line or as a sheet when an additional polarizer is used. We find good agreement
between the experimental results and our theoretical model, which predicts the
method to be in principle not diffraction-limited.

Conclusion: 复参数λ的引入揭示了XY模型的新特性，异常点的分布与拓扑相变相关，为理解非厄米系统的拓扑性质提供了新视角。

Abstract: The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free
fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of
quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's
anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the
quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these
quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of
the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct
$\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane
which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit
circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The
non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry
along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP
values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of
4.

Abstract: We present a compact, ionization-based detector for the state-selective and
spatially resolved measurement of individual Rydberg atoms trapped in the
vicinity of an atom chip. The system combines an electrostatic lens system for
guiding charged particles with an array of channel electron multipliers (CEMs)
capable of detecting both ions and electrons produced by ionization. Designed
for quantum information applications, this device enables the detection of
correlations between spatially separated Rydberg qubits. Additionally, the
electrodes provide compensation for stray electric fields and control over
particle trajectories. The imaging system achieves a total magnification of
more than 12, with a single-axis magnification up to 200, while maintaining low
aberrations. We characterize the performance of the system using a charged
particle trajectory simulation software and discuss how a coincidence
measurement of ions and electrons can be used to calibrate the detection
efficiency. This detector enables high-fidelity measurement of multiple Rydberg
atoms and is well-suited for applications in cavity-mediated quantum gates.

Motivation: 传统线性耦合读取方案存在Purcell效应和光子数限制，影响信噪比和QND特性，因此需要探索非线性耦合方案。

Method: 采用非线性耦合设计，基于Dassonneville等人的工作，利用transmon分子实现高功率读取。

Result: 实验显示99.21%的读取保真度（89光子），QND特性保持96.7%；理论临界光子数为377。

Conclusion: 非线性耦合在高功率读取中表现优异，为高保真量子比特读取提供了新途径。

Abstract: The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit
designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse
linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme
has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a
limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which
restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND)
nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a
nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach
builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045
(2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a
transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons
utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND
nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only
reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a
critical number of photons associated to the nonlinear coupling, yielding a
theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's
parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon
molecule in the high-power regime for high-fidelity qubit readout.

Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional
data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional quantum kernels, or
feature maps, for encoding data features onto a quantum circuit are currently
impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the
dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a
quantum kernel designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly
reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves
essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as
evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a
marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization, as compared to
state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulations results combined
with lower resource requirements highlight our kernel's ability to function
within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through
numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting
circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on
par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. Our
findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum
machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a
"disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum
many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the
disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate
dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting
fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic
Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal
matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based
on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as
unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a
natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the
circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then
explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary
circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the
intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For
each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which
we characterize both numerically and analytically.

Abstract: We develop a novel approach for Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) type
decomposition for structured sparse matrices. Such matrices frequently arise
during numerical solution of partial differential equations which are
ubiquitous in science and engineering. LCU is a versatile quantum algorithmic
primitive that plays an important role in context of both variational quantum
algorithms (VQA) and fully fault-tolerant ones, and has been applied to a
diverse range of problems. Conventionally, Pauli basis is used for LCU
decomposition, which however in worst case can result in number of LCU terms
that scale quadratically with respect to the matrix size. We show that by using
an alternate basis one can better exploit the sparsity and underlying structure
of matrix leading to number of tensor product terms which scale only
logarithmically with respect to the matrix size. We develop numerical and
semi-analytical approaches for computing sigma basis decomposition for an
arbitrary matrix. Given this new basis is comprised of non-unitary operators,
we employ the concept of unitary completion to design efficient quantum
circuits for evaluation of the expectation values of operators composed of
tensor product of elements from sigma basis which can be used for cost function
evaluation in VQAs. We also develop an approach for block encoding of arbitrary
operator given its decomposition in sigma basis which could be used in variety
of fully fault-tolerant algorithms. We compare our approach with other related
concepts in the literature including unitary dilation and provide numerical
illustrations on several PDE examples.

Abstract: Quantum correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, are a
fundamental resource for the development of quantum technologies, as they are
needed for applications in quantum metrology, quantum computation, and quantum
communications. It is thus critical to develop compact, efficient, and robust
sources to generate such states. Here we report on a compact, narrowband,
fiber-coupled source of two-mode squeezed states of light at 795 nm based on
four wave mixing (FWM) in a $^{85}$Rb atomic vapor. The source is designed in a
small modular form factor, with two input fiber-coupled beams, the seed and
pump beams required for the FWM, and two output fibers, one for each of the
modes of the squeezed state. The system is optimized for low pump power (135
mW) to achieve a maximum intensity-difference squeezing of 4.4 dB after the
output fibers at an analysis frequency of 1 MHz. The narrowband nature of the
source makes it ideal for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking
configurations that rely on atomic quantum memories. Such a source paves the
way for a versatile and portable platform for applications in quantum
information science.

Abstract: Nonlinear classical mechanics has established countless intriguing and
profound phenomena. These include limit tori defined by toroidal attractors
that support quasiperiodic motion of at least two incommensurate frequencies.
Here we address the question, whether and how such phenomena persist in open
quantum systems. We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the
Lindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled
driven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian
and the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the
quantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs
of purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent
quasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small
negative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of
these modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the
classical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase
transition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry.
Analysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced
dephasing as the primary mechanism behind this "quantum melting" of the torus.
We quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter,
revealing universal scaling with both system size and time. These scaling laws
are robust and independent of microscopic parameters. Our results establish the
quantum melting of limit tori as a distinct non-equilibrium critical phenomenon
and provide concrete signatures for experimental observation in trapped ions
and superconducting circuits.

Abstract: Strong laser light drives complex quantum electron dynamics in solids, which
is captured by the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process. Here we report the
observation of laser-dressed Floquet-Bloch states (FBSs) at the edge of the
Brillouin zone (BZ) in HHG, by driving a large-bandgap MgO crystal in the
strong-field regime where the laser pulse is intense enough both to accelerate
electrons to the BZ edge as well as to dress the bands. We experimentally show
and numerically confirm that the HHG spectrum encodes the nonadiabatic coupling
between the conduction bands and FBSs, induced by the high-intensity driver,
when some high harmonics are resonant with the dressed band structure. This
enables us to trace the bandgap morphology - expanding HHG-spectroscopy
techniques to cover the HHG tomography of the BZ edge.

Abstract: We present a quantum jump/trajectory analysis of the two-photon interference
phenomenon in the context of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect (HOME). In particular,
we consider the standard setup of HOME, which consists of two-photon sources
firing single photons from the opposite sides of a 50/50 beam splitter and two
perfect detectors placed at the output ports to record photodetection events.
For single-photon sources, we consider two special cases: (1) two excited
two-level atoms and (2) two atom-cavity setups with initially present single
photons in both cavities. For both cases, we report analytic results as well as
quantum jump-based Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the signatures of
these single-photon sources on the HOME under different working conditions (for
example, strong- and weak-coupling regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics).
Our results may have interesting applications in linear optics quantum
computing as well as in protocols that test the indistinguishability of
single-photon sources.

Motivation: 量子测量的内在概率性使其成为安全的随机数生成源，但实际应用中需解决相关性和效率问题。

Method: 采用Von Neumann提取器及其变体进行后处理，并通过NIST测试评估去偏效果。

Result: 两种平台均可生成无偏比特流，但吞吐量低且成本高于专用QRNG设备。

Conclusion: 量子平台生成随机数可行，但效率和成本仍需优化。

Abstract: Quantum mechanics offers a fundamentally unpredictable entropy source due to
the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum measurements, making it
attractive for secure random number generation. This paper explores the
practicality of generating random numbers from two quantum platforms:
gate-based circuits on IBM Quantum and (Gaussian) boson sampling with Xanadu
Borealis. We implement simple post-processing methods, including the classic
Von Neumann extractor and two tailored variants designed to address the
correlated structure of boson sampling outputs. We evaluate debiased output
from real quantum hardware using the NIST SP800-22r1a test suite and measure
the extraction efficiency of each debiasing method. Results show that, while
unbiased bitstreams can be achieved on both platforms, throughput remains low
and cost per random bit is high compared to specialized QRNG devices.

TL;DR: 研究了C波段单光子的时间宽度，提出了基于SFWM的双光子生成理论模型，实验数据与模型预测一致，并提出了新的原子速度群概念，实现了迄今最长的28.3 ns时间宽度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C波段光子因其在光纤中的低损耗特性在通信中具有优势，但对其单光子时间宽度的研究较少，尤其是基于SFWM的双光子生成机制。

Method: 采用钻石型跃迁方案的SFWM过程，建立了理论模型，并通过实验验证了模型的准确性，同时提出了原子速度群的新概念。

Result: 实验观测到1529 nm单光子的时间宽度为28.3±0.6 ns，对应线宽为11.0±0.2 MHz，是目前同类研究中时间宽度最长的记录。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对SFWM双光子生成机制的理解，为C波段单光子源的进一步优化提供了重要参考。

Abstract: C-band photons are recognized for having the lowest loss coefficient in
optical fibers, making them highly favorable for optical fiber-based
communication. In this study, we systematically investigated the temporal width
of C-band heralded single photons and developed a theoretical model for
biphoton generation via the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process using a
diamond-type transition scheme, which has not been previously reported. Our
experimental data on temporal width closely aligns with the predictions of this
model. Additionally, we introduced a new concept: the atomic velocity group
relating to the two-photon resonance condition and the one-photon detuning in
this atomic frame. These two parameters are crucial for understanding the
behavior of the biphoton source. The concept indicates that the hot-atom source
behaves similarly to the cold-atom source. Guided by our theoretical model, we
observed 1529-nm (C-band) heralded single photons with a temporal width of
28.3$\pm$0.6 ns, corresponding to a linewidth of 11.0$\pm$0.2 MHz. For
comparison, the ultimate linewidth limit is 6.1 MHz, determined by the natural
linewidth of the atoms. Among all atom-based sources of 1300 to 1550 nm
heralded single photons utilizing either cold or hot atoms, the temporal width
achieved in this work represents the first instance of a width exceeding 10 ns,
making it (or its linewidth) the longest (or narrowest) record to date. This
work significantly enhances our understanding of diamond-type or cascade-type
SFWM biphoton generation and marks an important milestone in achieving greater
temporal width in atom-based sources of C-band heralded single photons.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement constitutes a pivotal resource, serving as a fundamental
cornerstone within the field of quantum information science. In recent years,
the study of vortex light entanglement has garnered widespread attention due to
its unique structure and inherent advantages; however, the majority of these
investigations are primarily focused on discrete variable (DV) systems. In this
paper, we present a theoretical framework for generating vortex optical
entanglement in coherently prepared media, employing continuous variable (CV)
analysis and leveraging Raman scattering as an alternative to the conventional
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) method. The entanglement arises
from the quantum correlation between the two light fields, induced by atomic
coherence. Using numerical simulations, we thoroughly explore the impact of
various tunable system parameters on the degree of entanglement, ultimately
identifying the optimal conditions for maximal entanglement. Our findings offer
a reference framework for vortex light entanglement, with potential
implications across quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum
computing, high-dimensional quantum information, and other related fields.

Abstract: We present a parallel device independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD)
protocol based on the CHSH game and prove its security. Using techniques
developed for analysing the parallel repetition of anchored non-local games, we
show that the answers on a small random linear subset of the games in the DIQKD
protocol can be simulated as the output of a single-round strategy for playing
the CHSH game. Then, we use the recently developed unstructured approximate
entropy accumulation theorem to establish the smooth min-entropy lower bound
required for the security proof. Our approach yields a more
information-theoretic and general proof for parallel DIQKD compared to previous
proofs.

Abstract: We present a general approach to error detection of bosonic quantum
error-correction codes via an adaptive quantum phase estimation algorithm
assisted by a single ancilla qubit. The approach is applicable to a broad class
of bosonic codes whose error syndromes are described by symmetry or stabilizer
operators, including the rotation-symmetric codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
(GKP) codes. The detection precision scales inversely with the total evolution
time and thus reaches the Heisenberg limit. We numerically demonstrate the
approach for several examples, such as detecting bosonic excitation loss errors
in high-order cat or binomial codes and displacement errors in finite-energy
GKP codes. We also extend the approach to efficiently generate arbitrary Fock
states. Our schemes are feasible in present-day experiments.

we provide protocol designs which yield quantum protocols with improved

for Rabin oblivious transfer. To quantify the security of this task with
asymmetric cheating definitions, we introduce the notion of cheating advantage
which may be of independent interest in the study of other asymmetric
cryptographic primitives.

Abstract: We assess the potential of quantum computing to accelerate computation of
central tasks in genomics, focusing on often-neglected theoretical limitations.
We discuss state-of-the-art challenges of quantum search, optimization, and
machine learning algorithms. Examining database search with Grover's algorithm,
we show that the expected speedup vanishes under realistic assumptions. For
combinatorial optimization prevalent in genomics, we discuss the limitations of
theoretical complexity in practice and suggest carefully identifying problems
genuinely suited for quantum acceleration. Given the competition from excellent
classical approximate solvers, quantum computing could offer a speedup in the
near future only for a specific subset of hard enough tasks in assembly, gene
selection, and inference. These tasks need to be characterized by core
optimization problems that are particularly challenging for classical methods
while requiring relatively limited variables. We emphasize rigorous empirical
validation through runtime scaling analysis to avoid misleading claims of
quantum advantage. Finally, we discuss the problem of trainability and
data-loading in quantum machine learning. This work advocates for a balanced
perspective on quantum computing in genomics, guiding future research toward
targeted applications and robust validation.

four-wave mixing in a three-level cold atomic ensemble. The measured two-photon
temporal correlations show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions

time-resolved two-photon interference to reconstruct the complex temporal
wavefunction. Both the amplitude and phase profiles exhibit clear symmetry
under photon exchange, providing a direct confirmation of bosonic exchange
symmetry in the time domain.

Abstract: Temperature estimation, known as thermometry, is a critical sensing task for
physical systems operating in the quantum regime. Indeed, thermal fluctuations
can significantly degrade quantum coherence. Therefore, accurately determining
the system's operating temperature is a crucial first step toward
distinguishing thermal noise from other sources of decoherence. In this work,
we estimate the unknown temperature of a collection of identical and
independent two-level atoms dispersively probed by a single-mode quantized
electromagnetic field. In contrast to previous works, we present an analytical
sensing analysis demonstrating that the joint atom-field evolution -- without
any assumptions or approximations -- can achieve, at best, the standard quantum
limit of precision concerning the number of field excitations. To investigate
our analysis further, we propose and implement a quantum thermometer based on a
nonlinear Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which we realize through quantum digital
simulation. Our simulation is highly flexible regarding atomic state
preparation, allowing the initialization of atomic ensembles with positive and
effective negative temperatures. This makes our platform a promising and
versatile testbed for benchmarking thermometric capabilities in current quantum
simulators.

Conclusion: 被动基选择的BB84协议在大多数情况下与主动实现性能相近，且安全性得到验证。

Abstract: The Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol (BB84 protocol) is one of the simplest
protocols for implementing quantum key distribution (QKD). In the protocol, the
sender and the receiver iteratively choose one of two complementary measurement
bases. Regarding the basis choice by the receiver, a passive setup has been
adopted in a number of its implementations including satellite QKD and time-bin
encoding one. However, conventional theoretical techniques to prove the
security of BB84 protocol are not applicable if the receiver chooses his
measurement basis passively, rather than actively, with a biased probability,
followed by the measurement with threshold detectors. Here we present a fully
analytical security proof for such a decoy-state BB84 protocol with receiver's
passive basis choice and measurement with threshold detectors. Thanks to the
analytic nature, our security proof can straightforwardly be lifted up to the
one over coherent attacks. The numerical simulations under practical situations
show that the difference in secure key rate between the active and the passive
implementations of the protocol is negligible except for long communication
distances.

Abstract: Unlike classical algorithms, where second quantization is ubiquitous, the
nature of quantum computers enables both the first- and second-quantized
representations to be on somewhat equal footing. While quantum algorithms of
both quantizations provide advantages over classical algorithms for ground
state calculation and time-evolution, they face distinct limitations and
inefficiencies in addressing real-world molecular and material simulation
problems. As an example, the first-quantized representation is unsuitable for
calculating electron non-conserving properties, such as dynamic correlations.
Conversely, the ground-state molecular orbital wavefunction efficiently
prepared in the second quantization may benefit from efficient first-quantized
measurement circuits. In light of this, we propose a hybrid quantization scheme
for electronic simulations that employs a conversion circuit to switch
efficiently between the two quantizations, achieving a gate cost of
$\mathcal{O}(N\log N \log M)$ and requiring $\mathcal{O}(N \log M)$ qubits for
a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals. This way, plane-wave Hamiltonian
simulations can be done efficiently in the first-quantization before converting
to the second quantization to apply electron non-conserving operations.
Similarly, second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation algorithms can take
advantage of efficient measurement circuits originally designed for the
first-quantized representation. We discuss applications of this hybrid
quantization scheme to bring polynomial circuit improvements in the
characterization of ground-state and excited-state properties, and in
performing ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations of highly featured problems represents
a formidable challenge, where reaching high precision across multiple length
scales can require a prohibitive amount of computer memory or computing time.
However, the solutions to physics problems typically have structures operating
on different length scales, and as a result exhibit a high degree of
compressibility. Here, we use the quantics tensor train representation to build
a solver for the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that
the quantics approach generalizes well to the presence of the non-linear term
in the equation. We show that we can resolve phenomena across length scales
separated by seven orders of magnitude in one dimension within one hour on a
single core in a laptop, greatly surpassing the capabilities of more naive
methods. We illustrate our methodology with various modulated optical trap
potentials presenting features at vastly different length scales, including
solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on two-dimensional grids above a
trillion points ($2^{20} \times 2^{20}$). This quantum-inspired methodology can
be readily extended to other partial differential equations combining spatial
and temporal evolutions, providing a powerful method to solve highly featured
differential equations at unprecedented length scales.

Abstract: Complete orthonormal sets of exponential-type orbitals with non-integer
principal quantum numbers are discussed as basis functions in non-relativistic
Hartree-Fock-Roothaan electronic structure calculations of atoms. A method is
proposed to construct accurate and computationally efficient basis sets using
these orbitals. It is demonstrated that principal quantum numbers of fractional
order cannot be treated solely as variational parameters, since such a
procedure may lead to unphysical basis sets (in particular, linearly dependent
Slater-type functions). Ground-state total energies for the Be- and Ne-
isoelectronic series are calculated. The results obtained are lower than those
reported using other published basis sets. However, the energies obtained using
Slater-type functions with non-integer principal quantum numbers are omitted
from the comparison. These "orbitals" have no physical interpretation (except
the "1s", which coincides with a hydrogenlike eigenfunction). In general linear
independence of such Slater-type orbitals is not guaranteed. The results
confirm that the parameter alpha, used to represent the complete orthonormal
exponential-type orbitals in the weighted Hilbert space, is neither observable
nor suitable to be considered as a variational parameter, despite its treatment
as such in some prior work.

Abstract: Entanglement generation between distant nodes is a fundamental process in
distributed quantum information processing. Qudits, high-dimensional quantum
states, are promising candidates for enhancing entanglement distribution
capabilities. However, the success probability of qudit entanglement
distribution using Bell measurements is typically lower than that of
conventional qubit-based protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel
entanglement swapping protocol specifically designed for qutrits
(three-dimensional quantum states). Our protocol employs photon-number encoding
combined with an additional mode basis, such as polarization, effectively
increasing the success probability. We show that the proposed qutrit protocol
can achieve higher entanglement generation rates compared to conventional
two-photon detection-based qubit protocols, especially under conditions of
limited photon generation probability. Furthermore, we evaluate our protocol
under realistic experimental imperfections, including photon loss and threshold
detection, and show that it achieves high fidelity with probabilistic photon
sources.

Abstract: Measurement is a fundamental operation in quantum computing and has many
important use cases in quantum algorithms. This article provides a
comprehensive overview of the basic measurement operations in quantum computing
and represents a selected set of their applications in quantum algorithms. Our
goal is to provide one of the first algorithmic overviews of measurement
processes in quantum computing. From the quantum information-theoretical
perspective, measurements are either a method to access the result of a quantum
computation or a technique to modify a quantum state. We also identify
measurement-based methods to solve quantum computational challenges, such as
error mitigation and circuit cutting. We discuss three main categories of
measurements: performing measurements in static quantum circuits, modifying the
quantum state in dynamic quantum circuits via measurements, and addressing
challenges in quantum computing with measurements. Based on the reviewed
topics, the measurement operations are frequently not at the center of the
quantum algorithm design. However, the most novel and error-prone quantum
algorithms will likely require sophisticated measurement schemes. Thus, the

Abstract: Energy-efficient healthcare systems are becoming increasingly critical for
Industry 5.0 as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) expands, particularly
with the integration of 5G technology. 5G-enabled IoMT systems allow real-time
data collection, high-speed communication, and enhanced connectivity between
medical devices and healthcare providers. However, these systems face energy
consumption and data security challenges, especially with the growing number of
connected devices operating in Industry 5.0 environments with limited power
resources. Quantum computing integrated with machine learning (ML) algorithms,
forming quantum machine learning (QML), offers exponential improvements in
computational speed and efficiency through principles such as superposition and
entanglement. In this paper, we propose and evaluate three QML algorithms,
which are UU{\dag}, variational UU{\dag}, and UU{\dag}-quantum neural networks
(QNN) for classifying data from four different datasets: 5G-South Asia, Lumos5G
1.0, WUSTL EHMS 2020, and PS-IoT. Our comparative analysis, using various
evaluation metrics, reveals that the UU{\dag}-QNN method not only outperforms
the other algorithms in the 5G-South Asia and WUSTL EHMS 2020 datasets,
achieving 100% accuracy, but also aligns with the human-centric goals of
Industry 5.0 by allowing more efficient and secure healthcare data processing.
Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed quantum algorithms is verified
against several noisy channels by analyzing accuracy variations in response to
each noise model parameter, which contributes to the resilience aspect of
Industry 5.0. These results offer promising quantum solutions for 5G-enabled
IoMT healthcare systems by optimizing data classification and reducing power
consumption while maintaining high levels of security even in noisy
environments.

Abstract: Simulating a quantum circuit with a classical computer requires exponentially
growing resources. Decision diagrams exploit the redundancies in quantum
circuit representation to efficiently represent and simulate quantum circuits.
But for complicated quantum circuits like the quantum supremacy benchmark,
there is almost no redundancy to exploit. Therefore, it often makes sense to do
a trade-off between simulation accuracy and memory requirement. Previous work
on approximate simulation with decision diagrams exploits this trade-off by
removing less important nodes. In this work, instead of removing these nodes,
we try to find similar nodes to replace them, effectively slowing down the
fidelity loss when reducing the memory. In addition, we adopt Locality
Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to drastically reduce the computational complexity for
searching for replacement nodes. Our new approach achieves a better
memory-accuracy trade-off for representing a quantum circuit with decision
diagrams with minimal run time overhead. Notably, our approach shows good
scaling properties when increasing the circuit size and depth. For the first
time, a strong better-than-linear trade-off between memory and fidelity is
demonstrated for a decision diagram based quantum simulation when representing
the quantum supremacy benchmark circuits at high circuit depths, showing the
potential of drastically reducing the resource requirement for approximate
simulation of the quantum supremacy benchmarks on a classical computer.

Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation is paramount to the verification and optimization
of quantum algorithms, and considerable research efforts have been made towards
efficient simulators. While circuits often contain high-level gates such as
oracles and multi-controlled X (CkX) gates, existing simulation methods require
compilation to a low-level gate-set before simulation. This, however, increases
circuit size and incurs a considerable (typically exponential) overhead, even
when the number of high-level gates is small. Here we present a gadget-based
simulator which simulates high-level gates directly, thereby allowing to avoid
or reduce the blowup of compilation. Our simulator uses a stabilizer
decomposition of the magic state of non-stabilizer gates, with improvements in
the rank of the magic state directly improving performance. We then proceed to
establish a small stabilizer rank for a range of high-level gates that are
common in various quantum algorithms. Using these bounds in our simulator, we
improve both the theoretical complexity of simulating circuits containing such
gates, and the practical running time compared to standard simulators found in
IBM's Qiskit Aer library. We also derive exponential lower-bounds for the
stabilizer rank of some gates under common complexity-theoretic hypotheses. In
certain cases, our lower-bounds are asymptotically tight on the exponent.

Conclusion: 首次在资源受限的BwK模型中引入量子算法，为运筹学提供了新视角。

Abstract: Bandits with knapsacks (BwK) constitute a fundamental model that combines
aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. Classical
algorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret
bound of ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\log T)$. In
this paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum
computing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via
quantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent
regret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we
demonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a
factor of $(1+\sqrt{B/\mathrm{OPT}_\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget
constraint in BwK and $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of
a linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem. For the problem-dependent
setting, we develop a quantum algorithm using an inexact quantum linear
programming solver. This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of
the problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time
complexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts. Compared
to previous works on quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our study is
the first to consider bandit models with resource constraints and hence shed
light on operations research.

Conclusion: 该方案支持可扩展的实现，适用于多种多体量子信息系统。

Abstract: A quantum key distribution network enables pairs of users to generate
independent secret keys by leveraging the principles of quantum physics. For
end-to-end secure communication, a user pair's secret key must remain secure
against any third parties, including both external eavesdroppers and other
network users. However, isolating a given user pair from the remaining users
while maintaining a high key rate is challenging when all users are
intrinsically coupled and correlated, particularly in continuous-variable
networks. This results in either a low key rate, or incomplete end-to-end
security. Here, we introduce a multi-user security framework, offering a
general and comprehensive end-to-end key rate formula, against the
collaboration of the other network users and eavesdropper. Building on this
framework, we propose a multi-user protocol that achieves the theoretical upper
limit in all practical deployments within a 100 km range. Applied to a
three-node network, it achieves an Mbps-level per-user key rate and an overall
network key rate reaching 90\% of the upper limit. The proposed solution
supports scalable implementations using telecom-compatible components, while
the method for obtaining the accessible information in the network is broadly
applicable and can be extended to various multipartite quantum information
systems.

a viable and promising quantum repeater platform with significant integration
advantages over existing quantum memory technologies.

Abstract: We present a two-step protocol for quantum measurement tomography that is
light on classical co-processing cost and still achieves optimal sample
complexity in the system dimension. Given measurement data from a known probe
state ensemble, we first apply least-squares estimation to produce an
unconstrained approximation of the POVM, and then project this estimate onto
the set of valid quantum measurements. For a POVM with $L$ outcomes acting on a
$d$-dimensional system, we show that the protocol requires $\mathcal{O}(d^3 L
\ln(d)/\epsilon^2)$ samples to achieve error $\epsilon$ in worst-case distance,
and $\mathcal{O}(d^2 L^2 \ln(dL)/\epsilon^2)$ samples in average-case distance.
We further establish two almost matching sample complexity lower bounds of
$\Omega(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(d^2 L/\epsilon^2)$ for any non-adaptive,
single-copy POVM tomography protocol. Hence, our projected least squares POVM
tomography is sample-optimal in dimension $d$ up to logarithmic factors. Our
method admits an analytic form when using global or local 2-designs as probe
ensembles and enables rigorous non-asymptotic error guarantees. Finally, we
also complement our findings with empirical performance studies carried out on
a noisy superconducting quantum computer with flux-tunable transmon qubits.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Schr\"odinger equation in a
three-dimensional helically twisted space characterized by a non-trivial
torsion parameter. By applying exact separation of variables, we derive the
radial equation governing the dynamics of quantum particles in this geometric
background. Remarkably, the intrinsic coupling between angular and longitudinal
momenta induced by the torsion gives rise to an attractive Coulomb-like
potential term that emerges purely from the underlying geometry, without
introducing any external fields or interactions. We obtain exact analytical
solutions for the bound states, including both the energy spectrum and the
normalized wave functions. Numerical calculations are also performed, and
excellent agreement with the exact results is found. The interplay between the
torsion parameter and the effective Coulomb-like interaction is analyzed in
detail, showing how geometric deformation generates novel quantum confinement
mechanisms in twisted spaces.

Abstract: The question of whether entanglement between photons is equivalent to
entanglement between their characteristic field modes, specifically, the
single-particle wavefunctions that are composed and superposed to describe
identical particles, is a key, open problem concerning multi-partite optical
degrees of freedom, and has profound implications for topics ranging from
quantum foundations to quantum computation. In this Letter, I offer a fresh,
deeper, physical insight into this subtle, albeit enduring, issue by describing
a situation in which entangling interactions between optical modes, namely, the
wavefunctions can be distilled into genuine entanglement between the physical
properties of the photons, which are the wavefunctional degrees of freedom.
This theoretical observation also highlights the salience of the measurement
context, especially, of clearly disambiguating between the choice of the
quantum subsystem and the decision to measure an observable along a particular
axis of measurement, while quantifying and transforming quantum optical
entanglement. This understanding might be applied to formulate a new class of
protocols for distilling quantum magic from contextually and nonlocally
entangled photons within inseparable field modes.

Abstract: This paper presents the exact ground state solution for a diatomic particle
system with position-dependent complex mass under action of a complex Morse
potential in the quantum domain. By solving the position-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation in extended complex phase space without assuming a
specific mass profile, we derive both the eigenfunctions and corresponding
eigenenergies using the analyticity conditions of the eigenfunctions. A key
focus is placed on addressing the challenge of normalization inherent in
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. To overcome the limitations of conventional
normalization methods in systems with complex potentials and spatially varying
mass, we propose a modified normalization approach based on a two-dimensional
integral over phase space. The results reveal that, under certain parameter
constraints, real energy spectra can arise in non Hermitian settings, supported
by normalized and physically meaningful eigenfunctions. Probability density
plots validate the existence of stable, localized bound states, maintaining
essential characteristics of the traditional Morse potential. Moreover, the
model offers potential applications in high-energy and cosmological physics,
particularly in the quantum description of exotic systems like dark matter.

Abstract: Efficient qubit reset and leakage reduction are essential for scalable
superconducting quantum computing, particularly in the context of quantum error
correction. However, such operations often require additional on-chip
components. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a mode-efficient
approach to qubit reset and readout using a multi-mode Purcell filter in a
superconducting quantum circuit. We exploit the inherent multi-mode structure
of a coplanar waveguide resonator, using its fundamental and second-order modes
for qubit reset and readout, respectively, thereby avoiding additional circuit
elements. Implemented in a flip-chip architecture, our device achieves
unconditional reset with residual excitation below 1% in 220 ns, and a leakage
reduction unit that selectively resets the second excited state within 62 ns.
Simulations predict Purcell-limited relaxation times exceeding 1 ms over an 800
MHz bandwidth. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental trial that
exploits different-order modes of a microwave resonator for distinct qubit
operations, representing a new direction toward scalable, mode-efficient
quantum processor design.

Abstract: We experimentally investigated a single-qubit quantum classifier implemented
on a silicon photonic integrated circuit, focusing on its performance under
photon-limited conditions. Using the Data Reuploading method with layer-wise
optimization via Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), input data were encoded
into the photonic circuit, and classification was performed based on output
detection probabilities. Heralded single photons, generated via spontaneous
four-wave mixing in a silicon waveguide, served as the input states. Even when
the average number of photon samples per input was reduced to approximately
two, the classifier achieved nearly 90\% accuracy, provided that the training
dataset was sufficiently large. The experimental results were consistent with
numerical simulations, which also indicated that performance at low sample
sizes can be improved by increasing the size of the training dataset. These
findings demonstrate that photonic quantum classifiers can operate effectively
with very few photons, supporting their practical feasibility for
resource-efficient quantum machine learning on integrated photonic platforms.

Abstract: Multiport interferometers can be constructed out of two-port components in

Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of
quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed
inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results
of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the
underlying mathematical structures are permitted. In the concluding Part II of
the paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the
phenomenological inputs described in Part I. We show that the resulting
formalism exhibits an affinity with Hilbert spaces, and we derive an explicit
representation in terms of those mathematical structures. Analogues of the
obtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are
readily identifiable within the standard formalism. However, once these
building blocks are assembled according to the blueprint of the deduced
bi-trajectory formalism, it becomes evident that the new and the standard
formalisms differ substantially at the conceptual level. These differences do
not negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect
to empirically testable predictions. Rather, the emergence of a novel,
non-standard formulation should be seen as a relatively rare opportunity to
reassess, from a fresh perspective, some of the long-standing foundational
issues in the theory. The hope is that the new approach may prove more
successful in addressing problems that have resisted resolution within the
established theoretical framework.

Conclusion: 最佳探针具有普适性，适用于任何SU(2)参数估计问题，且对易性对估计精度有显著影响。

Abstract: Quantum multiparameter estimation offers a framework for the simultaneous
estimation of multiple parameters, pertaining to possibly noncommutating
observables. While the optimal probe for estimating a single unitary phase is
well understood - being a pure state that is an equal superposition of the
eigenvectors of the encoding Hamiltonian corresponding to its maximum and
minimum eigenvalues - the structure of optimal probes in the multiparameter
setting remains more intricate. We investigate the simultaneous estimation of
two phases, each encoded through arbitrary qubit Hamiltonians, using arbitrary
weight matrices, and considering single-qubit probes. We also consider
single-qutrit probes, for which the encoding Hamiltonians are chosen as SU(2)
generators. We find that in both the qubit and qutrit scenarios, the optimal
probe is a coherent superposition of the eigenstates corresponding to the
largest and smallest eigenvalues of the total encoding Hamiltonian, with a
fixed - and not arbitrary - relative phase. Remarkably, this optimal probe is
independent of the specific choice of weight matrix, making it a universally
optimal input state for the estimation of any pair of SU(2) parameters, which
can be reparameterized to the phase estimation problem. Furthermore, we show
that this probe also maximizes the determinant of the quantum Fisher
information matrix, providing a handy tool for identifying the optimal probe
state. We also examine the role of commutativity between the generators of the
unitary encodings. Our results demonstrate that a high degree of commutativity
degrades the achievable precision, rendering estimation infeasible in the
extreme case. However, maximal noncommutativity does not necessarily yield
optimal precision.

Abstract: The precise control of light-matter interaction serves as a cornerstone for
diverse quantum technologies, spanning from quantum computing to advanced atom
optics. Typical experiments often feature multi-mode fields and require atoms
with intricate internal structures to facilitate e.g., multi-photon
interactions or cooling. Moreover, the development of high-precision cold-atom
sensors necessitates the use of entangled atoms. We introduce a rigorous,
second-quantized framework for describing multi-$\Lambda$-atoms in a cavity,
encompassing their center-of-mass motion and interaction with a two-mode
electromagnetic field. A key feature of our approach is the systematic
application of a Hamiltonian averaging theory to the atomic field operators,
enabling the derivation of a compact and physically insightful effective
Hamiltonian governing the system's time evolution. This effective Hamiltonian
not only incorporates the AC-Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts, augmented by
contributions from all involved ancillary states, but also includes effects
from counter-rotating terms, offering a more complete description than
conventional RWA-based models. A significant finding is the emergence of a
particle-particle interaction mediated by ancillary states, stemming directly
from the combined quantum nature of the coupled electromagnetic field and
atomic system. We illustrate the practical implications of our model through an
analysis of atomic Raman diffraction, determining the time evolution for a
typical initial state and demonstrating the resulting Rabi oscillations.
Furthermore, our results confirm that both the atomic and optical
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can be observed within this Raman configuration,
utilizing a specific two-particle input state, thereby extending the utility of
Raman diffraction for quantum interference phenomena and providing a
microscopic model of the effect.

Abstract: Resonance fluorescence of natural or artificial atoms constitutes a prime
method for generating non-classical light. While most efforts have focused on
producing single-photons, multi-photon emission is unavoidably present in the
resonant driving of an atom. Here, we study the extent to which these processes
occur: we quantify the multi-photon emission statistics in a resonantly-driven
two-level artificial atom -- a semiconductor quantum dot in a micropillar
cavity -- when pumped by short optical pulses. By measuring auto-correlation
functions up to the fourth order, we observe up to four photons emitted after a
single pumping pulse, and investigate the emission dynamics with finely
resolved temporal measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method based on
acquisition time gating to enhance the purity of a single-photon source while
maintaining high efficiencies. Our results deepen the understanding of the
photon emission processes in coherently driven atomic systems, and suggest a
simple but effective technique to reduce the multi-photon components of a
single-photon source.

Motivation: 随着量子计算向实际应用发展，量子操作系统需要支持多编程以提高硬件利用率，但现有量子编译工作多局限于单电路执行，限制了资源效率和量子操作系统的发展。

Method: DYNAMO通过并行编译和跨多个量子处理单元（QPUs）的智能资源分配，解决了资源分区低效和并发程序调度冲突的挑战，实现了高效的空间和时间资源共享。

Result: 实验表明，DYNAMO在12至1200门电路上实现了最高14.39倍的编译加速，平均减少50.47%的执行阶段，并成功在多QPUs间平衡负载。

Conclusion: DYNAMO为量子操作系统的实际实现奠定了关键基础，通过高效的多编程能力推动了量子计算的发展。

Abstract: As quantum computing advances towards practical applications, quantum
operating systems become inevitable, where multi-programming -- the core
functionality of operating systems -- enables concurrent execution of multiple
quantum programs to enhance hardware utilization. However, most quantum
compilation work focuses solely on single-circuit execution, severely limiting
resource efficiency and hindering quantum operating system development. We
propose Dynamic Neutral Atom Multi-programming Optimizer (DYNAMO), a method
that realizes multi-programming on neutral atom quantum architectures through
parallel compilation and intelligent resource allocation across multiple
quantum processing units (QPUs). DYNAMO addresses two critical challenges:
inefficient and difficult resource partitioning, and complex scheduling
conflicts from concurrent program. Our method enables efficient spatial and
temporal resource sharing while maintaining circuit correctness and hardware
constraints. Experimental evaluation across circuits ranging from 12 to over
1200 gates demonstrates that DYNAMO achieves up to 14.39x compilation speedup
while reducing execution stages by an average of 50.47%. Furthermore, DYNAMO
successfully distributes workloads across multiple QPUs with balanced resource
utilization. By enabling efficient multi-programming capabilities, DYNAMO
establishes a critical foundation towards realizing practical quantum operating
systems.

Abstract: Understanding the Lie algebraic structure of a physical problem often makes
it easier to find its solution. In this paper, we focus on the Lie algebra of
Gaussian-conserving superoperators. We construct a Lie algebra of $n$-mode
states, $\mathfrak{go}(n)$, composed of all superoperators conserving
Gaussianity, and we find it isomorphic to
$\mathbb{R}^{2n^2+3n}\oplus_{\mathrm{S}}\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. This
allows us to solve the quadratic-order Redfield equation for any, even
non-Gaussian, state. We find that the algebraic structure of Gaussian
operations is the same as that of super-Poincar\'e algebra in three-dimensional
spacetime, where the CPTP condition corresponds to the combination of causality
and directionality of time flow. Additionally, we find that a bosonic density
matrix satisfies both the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. Finally, we
expand the algebra of Gaussian superoperators even further by relaxing the CPTP
condition. We find that it is isomorphic to a superconformal algebra, which
represents the maximal symmetry of the field theory. This suggests a deeper
connection between two seemingly unrelated fields, with the potential to
transform problems from one domain into another where they may be more easily
solved.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a generalized model of photodetection in which the
detector couples simultaneously to both electric and magnetic components of the
electromagnetic field. Extending Glauber's seminal theory, we show that such
detectors, now experimentally feasible via meta-materials, can yield
interference patterns that depend strongly on the internal response of the
detector. In particular, we show that for a two-source interference setup,
coherent electric-magnetic dipole coupling can suppress or enhance interference
visibility, revealing a clear instance of measurement contextuality in quantum
optics, where the outcome depends on how the system is probed.

Abstract: We provide experimental validation of tight entropic uncertainty relations

is based on pulsed frequency bins measured with a multi-output quantum pulse
gate, which can perform projective measurements on a complete high-dimensional
basis in the time-frequency domain. Our results fit the theoretical
predictions: the bound on the sum of the entropies is never violated and is
saturated by the states that minimize the uncertainty relations.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a violation of local realism with negligible
spatial postselection on the polarization-entangled two-photon states produced
by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) pumped by a spatially
incoherent light source-a light-emitting diode (LED). While existing studies
have observed such a violation only by post-selecting the LED-pumped SPDC into
a single spatial detection mode, we achieve a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality violation of $S = 2.532 \pm 0.069 > 2$ using a spatially multimode
detection setup that supports more than 45,000 spatial modes. These results
indicate that coherent pump sources, such as lasers, are not required for
SPDC-based entanglement generation. Our work could enable novel and practical
sources of entangled photons for quantum technologies such as
device-independent quantum key distribution and quantum-enhanced sensing.

Abstract: The last decades have seen the development of quantum machine learning,
stemming from the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. This
field is particularly promising for the design of alternative quantum (or
quantum inspired) computation paradigms that could require fewer resources with
respect to standard ones, e.g. in terms of energy consumption. In this context,
we present the implementation of a data re-uploading scheme on a photonic
integrated processor, achieving high accuracies in several image classification
tasks. We thoroughly investigate the capabilities of this apparently simple
model, which relies on the evolution of one-qubit states, by providing an
analytical proof that our implementation is a universal classifier and an
effective learner, capable of generalizing to new, unknown data. Hence, our
results not only demonstrate data re-uploading in a potentially
resource-efficient optical implementation but also provide new theoretical
insight into this algorithm, its trainability, and generalizability properties.
This lays the groundwork for developing more resource-efficient machine
learning algorithms, leveraging our scheme as a subroutine.

Abstract: Optically active spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials have recently
emerged as versatile quantum sensors, enabling applications from nanoscale
magnetic field detection to the exploration of novel quantum phenomena in
condensed matter systems. Their ease of exfoliation and compatibility with
device integration make them promising candidates for future quantum
technologies. Here we report the observation and room-temperature coherent
control of spin defects in the high-temperature crystalline phase of germanium
disulfide ($\beta$-GeS2), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with low nuclear
spin density. The observed spin defects exhibit spin-1/2 behavior, and their
spin dynamics can be explained by a weakly coupled spin-pair model. We
implement dynamical decoupling techniques to extend the spin coherence time
(T$_2$) by a factor of 20. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT)
calculations to estimate the structure and spin densities of two possible spin
defect candidates. This work will help expand the field of quantum sensing with
spin defects in van der Waals materials.

Experimentally, we develop methodologies for estimating the magnetic field

the known spin Hamiltonians. We measured the optical Rabi frequency of 21
transitions among the 36 possible optical-hyperfine transitions, allowing for
the construction of a 6x6 branching ratio matrix of relative transition

mechanism that selects and aggregates specialized quantum experts per input.
The empirical results from the proposed QMoE on quantum classification tasks

Result: 对于α∈(1,2]，目标函数值线性收敛；对于α∈(1/2,1)，次线性收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算双最小化PRMI提供了有效途径，适用于更广泛的量子态。

Abstract: The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information (PRMI) of order $\alpha$
is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a
fixed bipartite quantum state $\rho_{AB}$ relative to any product state
$\sigma_A\otimes \tau_B$. To date, no closed-form expression for this measure
has been found, necessitating the development of numerical methods for its
computation. In this work, we show that alternating minimization over
$\sigma_A$ and $\tau_B$ asymptotically converges to the doubly minimized PRMI
for any $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)\cup (1,2]$, by proving linear convergence of
the objective function values with respect to the number of iterations for
$\alpha\in (1,2]$ and sublinear convergence for $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$.
Previous studies have only addressed the specific case where $\rho_{AB}$ is a
classical-classical state, while our results hold for any quantum state
$\rho_{AB}$.

Abstract: The global phase diagram of the Ashkin-Teller spin glass is calculated in d =
3 spatial dimensions by renormalization-group theory. Depending on the value of
the positive or negative four-spin interaction, qualitatively different
topologies are found for the spin-glass phase diagram in the usual variables of
temperature and fraction of antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor interactions.
Two different spin-glass phases occur. Both spin-glass phases are chaotic. One
spin-glass exhibits phase reentrance that is reverse from the reentrances seen
in previous spin-glass phase diagrams. Seven different phases: Ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic, entropic ferromagnetic and entropic antiferromagnetic,
spin-glass and entropic spin-glass, and disordered phases occur. The entropic
ferromagnetic phase unusually but understandably occurs at temperatures above
one spin-glass phase. A random disorder line is identified and no phase
transition occurs on this lie. Our calculation is exact on the d = 3
hierarchical lattice and Migdal-Kadanoff approximate on the cubic lattice.

diagram is known to be governed by three distinct infinitely disordered fixed
points (IDFPs) that we study here. For square subsystems, it has been recently
established that quantum entanglement has a universal logarithmic correction
due to the corners of the subsystem at all three IDFPs. This corner
contribution has been proposed as an "entanglement susceptibility", a useful
tool to locate the phase transition and to measure the correlation length
critical exponent. Towards a deeper understanding, we quantify how the corner
contribution depends on the shape of the subsystem. While the corner
contribution remains universal, the shape-dependence is qualitatively different
in each universality class, also confirmed by line segment subsystems, a
special case of skeletal entanglement. Therefore, unlike in conformally
invariant systems, in general different subsystem shapes are versatile probes
to unveil new universal information on the phase transitions in disordered
quantum systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“Anderson-Skin (AS) 双重性”的新局域化现象，源于非厄米和准周期耦合系统中非厄米拓扑系统为无序系统提供拓扑输运通道，导致局域化的Anderson模式转变为皮肤模式。

Motivation: 研究非厄米和准周期耦合系统中局域化现象的独特行为，探索非厄米拓扑系统对无序系统的影响。

Method: 通过传递矩阵方法分析一维AS双重性，并讨论多体相互作用系统以验证其普遍性。

Result: 发现局域化状态在周期边界条件下表现为局域化，而在开放边界条件下表现为皮肤效应，证明了AS双重性的存在。

Conclusion: AS双重性是一种普遍现象，为非厄米和准周期系统中的局域化研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We report a novel localization phenomenon that emerges in non-Hermitian and
quasiperiodic coupled systems, which we dub ``Anderson-Skin (AS) dualism". The
emergence of AS dualism is due to the fact that non-Hermitian topological
systems provide non-trivial topological transport channels for disordered
systems, causing the originally localized Anderson modes to transform into skin
modes, i.e., the localized states within the point gap regions have dual
characteristics of localization under periodic boundary condition (PBC) and
skin effects under open boundary conditions (OBC). As an example, we
analytically prove the 1D AS dualism through the transfer matrix method.
Moreover, by discussing many-body interacting systems, we confirm that AS
dualism is universal.

Conclusion: 该方法为非晶材料的设计和模拟提供了新途径，填补了计算方法的空白。

Abstract: Generative models show great promise for the inverse design of molecules and
inorganic crystals, but remain largely ineffective within more complex
structures such as amorphous materials. Here, we present a diffusion model that
reliably generates amorphous structures up to 1000 times faster than
conventional simulations across processing conditions, compositions, and data
sources. Generated structures recovered the short- and medium-range order,
sampling diversity, and macroscopic properties of silica glass, as validated by
simulations and an information-theoretical strategy. Conditional generation
allowed sampling large structures at low cooling rates of 10$^{-2}$ K/ps to
uncover a ductile-to-brittle transition and mesoporous silica structures.
Extension to metallic glassy systems accurately reproduced local structures and
properties from both computational and experimental datasets, demonstrating how
synthetic data can be generated from characterization results. Our methods
provide a roadmap for the design and simulation of amorphous materials
previously inaccessible to computational methods.

Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional frustrated quantum Heisenberg model with
bond disorder on nearest-neighbor couplings using the recently introduced
Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States framework, which enables accurate and
efficient computation of disorder-averaged observables with a single
variational optimization. Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended
region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the
thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes
quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a
semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling
evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations,
unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.

Conclusion: 随机耦合的Kuramoto模型表现出复杂的动力学行为，频率同步受限，混沌普遍存在。

Abstract: Frustrated random interactions are a key ingredient of spin glasses. From
this perspective, we study the dynamics of the Kuramoto model with quenched
random couplings: the simplest oscillator ensemble with fully disordered
interactions. We answer some open questions by means of extensive numerical
simulations and a perturbative calculation (the cavity method). We show
frequency entrainment is not realized in the thermodynamic limit and that
chaotic dynamics are pervasive in parameter space. In the weak coupling regime,
we find closed formulas for the frequency shift and the dissipativeness of the
model. Interestingly, the largest Lyapunov exponent is found to exhibit the
same asymptotic dependence on the coupling constant irrespective of the
coupling asymmetry, within the numerical accuracy.

Abstract: We calculate the dynamical current and kinetic-energy correlation functions
for the first Mott lobe of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. We employ
the strong-coupling expansion up to sixth order in $x=t/U$, and the dynamical
density-matrix renormalization group method on rings with 64 sites. The
correlation functions are finite above the single-particle gap with a
square-root onset, as is also found from field theory close to the Mott
transition. The correlation functions display a featureless superposition of
the primary and tertiary Hubbard bands. We find very good agreement between all
methods in the interaction/frequency regimes where they are applicable.

Conclusion: 张量网络为经典计算和未来量子硬件之间的非线性薛定谔型偏微分方程数值处理提供了实用桥梁。

Abstract: We present a quantum-inspired solver for the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii
equation in the Quantics Tensor-Train (QTT) representation. By evolving the
system entirely within a low-rank tensor manifold, the method sidesteps the
memory and runtime barriers that limit conventional finite-difference and
spectral schemes. Two complementary algorithms are developed: an imaginary-time
projector that drives the condensate toward its variational ground state and a
rank-adapted fourth-order Runge-Kutta integrator for real-time dynamics. The
framework captures a broad range of physical scenarios - including
barrier-confined condensates, quasi-random potentials, long-range dipolar
interactions, and multicomponent spinor dynamics - without leaving the
compressed representation. Relative to standard discretizations, the QTT
approach achieves an exponential reduction in computational resources while
retaining quantitative accuracy, thereby extending the practicable regime of
Gross-Pitaevskii simulations on classical hardware. These results position
tensor networks as a practical bridge between high-performance classical
computing and prospective quantum hardware for the numerical treatment of
nonlinear Schrodinger-type partial differential equations.

Abstract: Quantum gases of ultracold polar molecules have novel properties because of
the strong dipolar forces between molecules. Current experiments shield the
molecules from destructive collisions by engineering long-range repulsive
interactions using microwave or static electric fields. These shielding methods
produce interaction potentials with large repulsive cores that are not well
described with contact potentials. In this paper we explore the anisotropic
interaction potentials that arise for pairs of polar molecules shielded with
static electric fields. We derive computationally inexpensive approximations
for the potentials that are suitable for use in calculations of many-body
properties. The interaction potentials for molecules shielded with static
fields are qualitatively different from those that arise from single-field
microwave shielding and will produce quite different many-body physics.

Abstract: The geometry-gauge interplay constitutes a fundamental issue in quantum
physics, with profound implications spanning from quantum gravity to
topological matter. Here, we investigate the dynamic effects of geometry-gauge
interplay in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on a Haldane sphere with a
magnetic monopole. We reveal an index theorem that establishes a correspondence
between BEC vortices and the topology of the gauge field, enabling the
construction of vortex-monopole composites. Furthermore, we derive the
universal logarithmic interaction between composites, which governs the
structure of the ground-state vortex lattice. By developing a kinetic theory,
we predict scale-invariant vortex dynamics and an emergent duality. Both are
confirmed through numerical simulations. This work first presents the dynamical
coupling mechanism between spatial geometry and gauge fields, providing deep
insights into superfluid systems with topological gauge structures in curved
space.

Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of dipolar bosons and fermions after
a sudden change in the interaction strength from zero to a finite repulsive
value. We simulate the interaction quench on the initial state which is the
ground state of harmonic potential with noninteracting bosons and fermions. We
solve the time-dependent many-boson Schr\"odinger equation exactly using
numerical methods. To understand the many-body dynamics we analyze several
measures of many-body information entropy, monitoring their time evolution and
assessing their dependence on interaction strength. We establish that for weak
interaction quench the dynamics is statistics independent, both dipolar bosons
and fermions do not relax. Whereas it is significantly different for dipolar
bosons from that of dipolar fermions in the stronger interaction quench. When
dipolar bosons exhibit concurrent signature of relaxation in all entropy
measures, dipolar fermions fail to relax. For dipolar bosons and for larger
interaction quench, the many-body information entropy measures dynamically
approach the value predicted for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random
matrices, implying statistical relaxation. The relaxation time is uniquely
determined when the orbital fragmentation exhibits a $1/M$ population in each
orbital ($M$ is the number of orbitals) and all entropy measures saturate to
the maximum entropy values. The relaxation time also becomes independent of the
strength of dipolar interaction. Whereas, for the same quench protocol, dipolar
fermions exhibit modulated oscillations in all entropy dynamics. Our study is
also complemented by the measures of delocalization in Hilbert space, clearly
establishing the onset of chaos for strongly interacting dipolar bosons. It
highlights the importance of many-body effects with a possible exploration in
quantum simulation with ultracold atoms.

Abstract: Cold atom experiments show that a mobile impurity particle immersed in a
Bose-Einstein condensate forms a well-defined quasiparticle (Bose polaron) for
weak to moderate impurity-boson interaction strengths, whereas a significant
line broadening is consistently observed for strong interactions. Motivated by
this, we introduce a phenomenological theory based on the assumption that the
most relevant states are characterized by the impurity correlated with at most
one boson, since they have the largest overlap with the uncorrelated states to
which the most common experimental probes couple. These experimentally relevant
states can however decay to lower energy states characterised by correlations
involving multiple bosons, and we model this using a minimal variational wave
function combined with a complex impurity-boson interaction strength. We first
motivate this approach by comparing to a more elaborate theory that includes
correlations with up to two bosons. Our phenomenological model is shown to
recover the main results of two recent experiments probing both the spectral
and the non-equilibrium properties of the Bose polaron. Our work offers an
intuitive framework for analyzing experimental data and highlights the
importance of understanding the complicated problem of the Bose polaron decay
in a many-body setting.

Abstract: We compute the complete set of second order transport coefficients of the

We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress
by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We
confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate
$\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into

Abstract: Solitons are striking manifestations of nonlinearity, encountered in diverse
physical systems such as water waves, nonlinear optics, and Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs). In BECs, dark solitons emerge as exact stationary solutions
of the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. While they can be long-lived
in elongated traps, their stability is compromised in higher dimensions due to
the snake instability, which leads to the decay of the soliton into vortex
structures among other excitations. We investigate the dynamics of a dark
soliton in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an anisotropic harmonic trap.
Using a variational ansatz that incorporates both the transverse bending of the
soliton plane and the emergence of vortices along the nodal line, we derive
equations of motion governing the soliton's evolution. This approach allows us
to identify stable oscillation modes as well as the growth rates of the
unstable perturbations. In particular, we determine the critical trap
anisotropy required to suppress the snake instability. Our analytical
predictions are in good agreement with full numerical simulations of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

Abstract: Recent advances have highlighted the rich low-temperature kinetics of the
long-range Ising model (LRIM). This study investigates domain growth in an LRIM
with quenched disorder, following a deep low-temperature quench. Specifically,
we consider an Ising model with interactions that decay as $J(r) \sim
r^{-(D+\sigma)}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension and $\sigma > 0$ is the
power-law exponent. The quenched disorder is introduced via random pinning
fields at each lattice site. For nearest-neighbor models, we expect that domain
growth during activated dynamics is logarithmic in nature: $R(t) \sim (\ln
t)^{\alpha}$, with growth exponent $\alpha >0$. Here, we examine how long-range
interactions influence domain growth with disorder in dimensions $D = 1$ and $D
= 2$. In $D = 1$, logarithmic growth is found to persist for various $\sigma >
0$. However, in $D = 2$, the dynamics is more complex due to the non-trivial
interplay between extended interactions, disorder, and thermal fluctuations.

Abstract: Rotational equilibrated systems are widespread, but relatively little
attention has been devoted to studying them from the first principles of
statistical mechanics. Here we bridge this gap, as we look at a Brownian
particle coupled with a rotational thermal bath modeled via Caldeira-Leggett
oscillators. We show that the Langevin equation that describes the dynamics of
the Brownian particle contains (due to rotation) long-range correlated noise.
In contrast to the usual situation of non-rotational equilibration, the
rotational Gibbs distribution is recovered only for a weak coupling with the
bath. However, the presence of a uniform magnetic field disrupts equilibrium,
even under weak coupling conditions. In this context, we clarify the
applicability of the Bohr-van Leeuwen theorem to classical systems in
rotational equilibrium, as well as the concept of work done by a changing
magnetic field. Additionally, we show that the Brownian particle under a
rotationally symmetric potential reaches a stationary state that behaves as an
effective equilibrium, characterized by a free energy. As a result, no work can
be extracted via cyclic processes that respect the rotation symmetry. However,
if the external potential exhibits asymmetry, then work extraction via slow
cyclic processes is possible. This is illustrated by a general scenario,
involving a slow rotation of a non-rotation-symmetric potential.

Abstract: We study the local entropy production rate and the local entropy flow in
active systems composed of non-interacting run-and-tumble particles in a
thermal bath. After providing generic time-dependend expressions, we focus on
the stationary regime. Remarkably, in this regime the two entropies are equal
and depend only on the distribution function and its spatial derivatives. We
discuss in details two case studies, relevant to real situations. First, we
analyze the case of space dependent speed,describing photokinetic bacteria,
cosidering two different shapes of the speed, piecewise constant and
sinusoidal. Finally, we investigate the case of external force fields, focusing
on harmonic and linear potentials, which allow analytical treatment. In all
investigated cases, we compare exact and approximated analytical results with
numerical simulations.

Abstract: We develop a method for deriving thermodynamic bounds for first-passage
problems of currents with two boundaries. Using this method, we extend some
results on first-passage times of fluctuating currents. Notably, we derive a
thermodynamic bound on the rate of dissipation of a Markov process in terms of
the splitting probabilities and the first-passage time statistics of a
fluctuating current, which is a refinement of a previously derived inequality.
We also show that the concept of effective affinity, originally developed for
continuous-time Markov chains, naturally extends to discrete-time Markov
chains. Furthermore, we analyse symmetries in first-passage problems of
fluctuating currents with two boundaries. We show that optimal currents --
those for which the effective affinity fully accounts for the dissipation --
satisfy a symmetry property: the current's average speed to reach the positive
threshold equals the current's speed to reach the negative threshold. The
developed approach uses a coarse-graining procedure for the average entropy
production at random times and utilises martingale methods to perform
time-reversal of first-passage quantities.

Abstract: The kappa distribution of velocities appears routinely in the study of
collisionless plasmas present in Earth's magnetosphere, the solar wind among
other contexts where particles are unable to reach thermal equilibrium.
Originally justified through the use of Tsallis' non-extensive statistics,
nowadays there are alternative frameworks that provide insight into these
distributions, such as superstatistics. In this work we review the derivation
of the multi-particle and single-particle kappa distributions for collisionless
plasmas within the framework of superstatistics, as an alternative to the use
of non-extensive statistics. We also show the utility of the superstatistical
framework in the computation of expectation values under kappa distributions.
Some consequences of the superstatistical formalism regarding correlations,
temperature and entropy of kappa-distributed plasmas are also discussed.

Conclusion: 熵分布的普适部分加倍，非普适部分可通过块托普利茨矩阵数值提取。

Abstract: We study the melting of a domain wall in free-fermion chains, where the
periodic variation of the hopping amplitudes gives rise to a band structure. It
is shown that the entanglement grows logarithmically in time, and the prefactor
is proportional to the number of filled bands in the initial state. For a
dimerized chain the particle density and current are found to have the same
expressions as in the homogeneous case, up to a rescaling of the velocity. The
universal contribution to the entropy profile is then doubled, while the
non-universal part can be extracted numerically from block-Toeplitz matrices.

Abstract: We show that long-wavelength interfacial fluctuations are strongly suppressed
in non-equilibrium phase coexistence between bulk hyperuniform systems. Using
simulations of three distinct microscopic models, we demonstrate that
hyperuniform interfaces are much smoother than equilibrium ones, with a
universal reduction of height fluctuations at large scale. We derive a
non-equilibrium interface equation from the field theory of the bulk order
parameter, and predict a reduction in height fluctuations, $S_h(\boldsymbol
k)\equiv \langle |h(\boldsymbol k)|^2\rangle\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-1}$, in
stark contrast to equilibrium capillary wave theory where $S_h(\boldsymbol
k)\sim |\boldsymbol k|^{-2}$. Our results establish a new universality class
for non-equilibrium interfaces, highlighting the fundamental role of suppressed
bulk fluctuations in shaping interfacial dynamics far from equilibrium.

Abstract: Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging
classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability.
However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we
provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from
microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau
framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic
coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier
distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic
limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form
T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to
experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder
statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a
natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying
memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent
physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from
heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling
complex critical dynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we present a compact analytical approximation for the quantum
partition function of systems composed of quantum oscillators. The proposed
formula is general and applicable to an arbitrary number of oscillators
described by a rather general class of potential energy functions (not
necessarily polynomials). Starting from the exact path integral expression of
the partition function, we introduce a time-dependent Gaussian approximation
for the potential contribution and, then, invoke a principle of minimal
sensitivity to minimize the error. This leads to a system of coupled nonlinear
equations whose solution yields the optimal parameters of the gaussian
approximation. The resulting approximate partition function accurately
reproduces thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy, average energy,
and specific heat -- even at zero temperature -- with typical errors of only a
few percent. We illustrate the performance of our approximate formula with
numerical results for systems of up to ten coupled anharmonic oscillators.
These results are compared to "exact" numerical results obtained via
Hamiltonian diagonalization for small systems and Path Integral Monte Carlo
simulations for larger ones.

Result: 证明了在周期性驱动下，逆Mpemba效应确实存在于孤立量子系统中。

Conclusion: 研究为多种系统中逆Mpemba效应的实现提供了统一的理论框架。

Abstract: The inverse Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system,
initially in thermal equilibrium and prepared at different temperatures below
that of the final equilibrium state, relaxes to the final state more rapidly
when starting from a lower initial temperature. We extend this concept to the
relaxation toward a prethermal state in isolated quantum systems. By examining
a simple model that exhibits prethermalization, we demonstrate that this effect
indeed manifests under periodic driving. We further discuss the realization of
this phenomenon in a variety of systems within a unified theoretical framework.

Abstract: For diffusion process involving the force $F(x)$ and the diffusion
coefficient $D(x)$, the continuity equation $\partial_t P_t(x)=-
\partial_xJ_t(x)$ gives the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ in terms of
the current $J_t( x)=F(x)P_t(x)-D(x)\partial_x P_t(x)={\cal J}P_t( x)$ obtained
from $P_t( x) $ via the application of the first-order differential
current-operator ${\cal J}$. So the dynamics of the probability $P_t( x)$ is
governed by the factorized Fokker-Planck generator ${\cal F}=-\partial_x{\cal
J}$, while the dynamics of the current $J_t( x)$ is governed by its
supersymmetric partner ${\hat {\cal F} }= - {\cal J}\partial_x$, so that their
right and left eigenvectors are directly related using the two intertwining
relations ${\cal J}{\cal F}=-{\cal J}\partial_x{\cal J}={\hat {\cal F}}{\cal
J}$ and ${\cal F}\partial_x=-\partial_x{\cal J}\partial_x=\partial_x{\hat {\cal
F} }$. We also describe the link with the factorization of the adjoint $ {\cal
F}^{\dagger}=\frac{d}{dm(x)}\frac{d}{ds(x)} $ in terms of the scale function
$s(x)$ and speed measure $m(x)$. We then analyze how the supersymmetric partner
${\hat {\cal F} } = - {\cal J} \partial_x$ can be re-interpreted in two ways:
(1) as the adjoint ${\mathring {\cal F}}^{\dagger} ={\mathring {\cal J}
}^{\dagger} \partial_x$ of the Fokker-Planck generator ${\mathring {\cal F}}=-
\partial_x{\mathring {\cal J} }$ associated to the dual force ${\mathring
F}(x)=-F(x)-D'(x)$, that unifies various known Markov dualities; (2) as the
non-conserved Fokker-Planck generator ${\tilde {\cal F}}_{nc} =
-\partial_x{\tilde {\cal J}}-{\tilde K }(x)$ involving the force ${\tilde
F}(x)=F(x) +D'(x)$ and the killing rate ${\tilde K }(x)=-F'(x)-D''(x)$, with
application to shape-invariance-solvability. Finally, we describe how all these
ideas can be also applied to Markov jump processes with nearest-neighbors
transition rates $w(x \pm 1,x)$.

Abstract: Diffusion over networks has recently been used to define spatiotemporal
scales and extend Kadanoff block spins of Euclidean space to supernodes of
networks in the Laplacian renormalization group (LRG). Yet, its ad hoc
coarse-graining procedure remains underdeveloped and unvalidated, limiting its
broader applicability. Here we rigorously formulate an LRG preserving the
equilibrium state, offering a principled coarse-graining procedure. We
construct the renormalized Laplacian matrix preserving dominant spectral
properties using a proper, quasi-complete basis transformation and the
renormalized adjacency matrix preserving mean connectivity from
equilibrium-state flows among supernodes. Applying recursively this
equilibrium-preserving LRG to various hypergraphs, we find that in hypertrees
with low spectral dimensions vertex degree and hyperedge cardinality
distributions flow toward Poissonian forms, while in hypergraphs lacking a
finite spectral dimension they broaden toward power-law forms when starting
from Poissonian ones, revealing how informational, structural, and dynamical
scale-invariances are interrelated.

Abstract: A novel approach to moment closure problem is used to derive low dimensional
laws for the dynamics of the moments of the membrane potential distribution in
a population of spiking neurons. Using spectral expansion of the density
equation we derive the recursive and nonlinear relation between the moments,
such as the mean potential, and the population firing rates. The
self-consistent dynamics found relies on the dominant eigenvalues of the
evolution operator, tightly related to the moments of the single-neuron
inter-spike interval distribution. Contrary to previous attempts our system can
be applied both in noise- and drift-dominated regime, and both for weakly and
strongly coupled population. We demonstrate the applicability of the theory for
the case of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons deriving closed
analytical expressions. Truncating the mode decomposition to the first few more
relevant moments, results to effectively describe the population dynamics both
out-of-equilibrium and in response to strongly-varying inputs.

Abstract: Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the
data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used
workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global
normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the
zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood
naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small,
patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those
of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on
uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured
datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics
(spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples
increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful
attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the
ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works
both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory
and generalization.

Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open
problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical
studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of
noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze
much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic
Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential
(AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections
to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least
an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and
converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances.
Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this
weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport
capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these
results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak
interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization
persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We
expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently
strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true
localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed
interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized
regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon
arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative
effects.

Abstract: Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in
condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate
results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how
relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and
two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of
the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve
efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of operator monomials for
different model parameters, we identify all first- and second-order transitions
based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry
breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using
these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional
transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer
Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter
changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our
work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying
and understanding quantum phase transitions.

Abstract: The nonlinear Seebeck effect, nonlinear conversion of a temperature gradient
into an electric current, was observed at room temperature. Based on a
second-harmonic lock-in method combined with an a.c. temperature gradient,
$\nabla T$, we measured a nonlinear Seebeck voltage in NiFe|Pt bilayers at 300
K, the amplitude of which increases in proportion to $(\nabla T)^2$. We also
observed that the nonlinear Seebeck voltage increases as the sample length
along the $\nabla T$ direction decreases, showing a characteristic scaling law
distinct from the conventional linear Seebeck effect. We developed a
phenomenological model for the nonlinear Seebeck effect incorporating the
spin-current induced modulation of the Seebeck coefficient, which well
reproduces the experimental results.

TL;DR: BaFe2Al9 exhibits a unique charge density wave (CDW) transition influenced by lattice strain. High-pressure studies reveal shifts in CDW transition temperature and changes in electrical resistivity, suggesting pressure modulates charge carriers. Structural anomalies under pressure further support CDW mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unusual CDW behavior in BaFe2Al9, particularly the role of lattice strain and pressure in modulating its electronic properties.

Method: High-pressure studies including electrical transport, magnetic, and structural property measurements, supplemented by synchrotron XRD.

Result: Pressure increases CDW transition temperature (TCDW) and alters resistivity, indicating charge carrier modulation. Structural anomalies under pressure suggest Fermi surface reconstruction.

Conclusion: Lattice strain and external pressure critically influence CDW formation in BaFe2Al9, providing insights into its electronic ground state.

Abstract: The intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 exhibits unusual physical properties
associated with a charge density wave (CDW) transition. Unlike conventional CDW
materials, which typically display subtle structural distortions or lattice
modulations, BaFe2Al9 undergoes a first-order phase transition in which lattice
strain plays a crucial role in the formation of the CDW state. To further
explore this unique behavior, we conducted high-pressure studies, examining the
electrical transport, magnetic, and structural properties to gain deeper
insight into the underlying CDW mechanism. At ambient pressure, electrical
resistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the presence of a CDW
transition. Upon applying pressure, the CDW transition temperature (TCDW)
shifts to higher values, reaching approximately 300 K near 3.2 GPa, and the
electrical resistivity increases, suggesting that pressure modulates the charge
carrier concentration. Furthermore, the initially sharp first-order transition
becomes more gradual, and analysis of the temperature derivative of resistivity
indicates a crossover from first-order to second-order like behavior under
pressure. High-pressure magnetization measurements are consistent with the
electrical transport data, showing an enhancement of TCDW with increasing
pressure. The residual resistivity increases with pressure, while the Fermi
liquid coefficient A decreases above 2 GPa, pointing to a possible Fermi
surface reconstruction. High-pressure synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements at room temperature reveal a lattice anomaly near 3.8 GPa,
marked by a distinct trend change in macrostrain, further supporting the
existence of a pressure induced structural response. These findings provide
valuable insight into the nature of CDW formation in BaFe2Al9 and highlight the
critical role of lattice strain and external pressure in tuning its electronic
ground state.

Abstract: CeRh6Ge4 is a Ce-based ferromagnetic material exhibiting a quantum critical
behavior under pressure. We derive effective exchange interactions, using the
framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field
theory. Our results reveal that the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction
along the c-axis is isotropic in spin space, leading to a formation of spin
chains. On the other hand, the inter-chain coupling is highly anisotropic: The
in-plane moment weakly interacts ferromagnetically in the a--b plane to
stabilize the ferromagnetic state, whereas the z-component couples
antiferromagnetically, contributing to its destabilization. The magnetic
anisotropy of the interchain interactions as well as of the local 4f
wavefunctions characterizes the magnetic properties underlying the
ferromagnetic transition and the quantum critical behavior in CeRh6Ge4.

Abstract: In f-electron materials like Pr or U compounds with non-Kramers states of the
f-shell the ground state may be a nonmagnetic singlet due to the action of the
crystalline electric field. Nevertheless these compounds can order
magnetically. They develop a ground state moment and long range order due to
the spontaneous admixture of the excited state into the ground state caused by
inter-site exchange. This mechanism can establish magnetic order if a control
parameter exceeds a critical value defining the quantum critical point between
disordered and magnetic phase. Here we investigate the magnetocaloric
properties of such quantum magnets where the entropy release at low temperature
is due to a competition between thermal depopulation and spontaneous order
effects. We determine field and temperature dependence of specific heat for
ferro- and antiferromagnetic order and also calculate the adiabatic magneto-
and barocaloric cooling rates. As a model application we discuss the magnetic
specific heat of the new induced ferromagnet PrI3. Furthermore we analyze the
excitation spectrum of the singlet induced moment magnets in an external field
with particular emphasis on field and temperature dependence of the critical
soft mode. We find that the latter is fragile and exists only at specific
points in the phase diagram.

Abstract: Electronically-driven nematic order breaks the rotational symmetry of a
system, e.g., through a Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface, with a
concomitant distortion of the lattice. As a result, in a metal, the nematic
collective mode interacts with two different sets of gapless excitations: the
particle-hole excitations of the metal and the lattice fluctuations that become
soft at the induced structural transition, namely, the transverse acoustic
phonons. However, the \textit{dynamics} of these hybridized collective modes
formed by the transverse acoustic phonons and the metallic electronic-nematic
fluctuations has remained largely unexplored. Here we address this problem by
developing a formalism in which the nemato-elastic coupling is obtained
microscopically from the direct coupling between electrons and transverse
acoustic phonons enabled by impurities present in the crystal. We then
demonstrate the emergence of hybrid nemato-elastic modes that mix the
characteristics of the transverse phonons and of the nematic fluctuations. Near
the nematic quantum critical point in a metal, two massless modes emerge with
intertwined dynamic behaviors, implying that neither mode dominates the
response of the system. We systematically study the non-trivial dependence of
these collective modes on the longitudinal and transverse momenta, revealing a
rich landscape of underdamped and overdamped modes as the proximity to the
quantum critical point and the strength of the electron-phonon coupling are
changed. Since dynamics play an important role for determining superconducting
instabilities, our results have implications for the study of pairing mediated
by electronic nematic fluctuations.

Conclusion: 非互易行为与磁矩排列方向密切相关，且Rashba自旋轨道耦合强度影响低能行为。

Abstract: We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard
ferromagnet within the random-phase approximation. We find that the
non-reciprocal behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned
in-plane and not out-of-plane. Furthermore, the spin-wave excitations exhibit
non-reciprocal behavior in a direction in the momentum space reciprocal to an
in-plane direction perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic moments. In
that case, the first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear.
However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term
is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the
intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba
spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological
applications and to discover new phenomena. In particular, advances of
experimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of
paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the
Fermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the
behavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform
Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the
specific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is
changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a
three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between
them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential
contributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic
contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat
behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion
coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms
experiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the
thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of
sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign.
Moreover, our specific heat results demonstrate interesting phenomena away from
the commonly studied half-filling regime.

Conclusion: 扭曲双层MoTe$_2$中的FCI准粒子表现出与理论预测一致的分数统计特性，为研究非阿贝尔准粒子提供了平台。

Abstract: We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized
fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted
bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a
tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy
dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by
short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the
localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the
impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI
quasiparticle localized at moir\'e lattice center closely follows the anyon
Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite
of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around
the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar
to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length
on the moir\'e lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough
estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the
impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as
expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI
quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of
fractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top
valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI
quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around
a quasiparticle. We also discuss the effect of band mixing on FCI
quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$.

Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport
in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy
($\Delta>1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices.
We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the
longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated
temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their
magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial
for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining
the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog
of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally,
we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary
spin.

Abstract: The Kagome lattice is a 2D network of corner sharing triangles found in
several rare earth materials resulting in a complicated and often frustrated
magnetic system. In the last decades, modifications of the motif, such as
breathing Kagome, asymmetric Kagome, and twisted Kagome were brought into the
limelight. In particular, the latter has lower symmetry than the original
Kagome and thus allows implementations of an "Ising-local" Hamiltonian, leading
to a 2D spin ice. One such material implementation, HoAgGe, was recently
reported to have an exceptionally rich phase diagram and is a strongly
frustrated 2D spin-ice material with a twisted-Kagome geometry. In the presence
of an external magnetic field the compound exhibits step-like magnetization
plateaus at simple fractions of the saturation magnetization. It is believed
that this phenomenon results from strong single-site anisotropy, which in
HoAgGe was found to be in-plane and along a high-symmetry direction. Previous
Monte Carlo simulations with empirical exchange parameters explain some, but
not all experimental observations. In this work we present (a) first-principle
calculations of the crucial model parameters and (b) direct energy minimization
via a Reduced-Configuration-Space search, as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of
the field-dependent phase diagram. We find that for HoAgGe the calculated
exchange parameters are very different from the earlier suggested empirical
ones, and describe the phase diagram much more accurately. This is likely
because the first-principles parameters are, in addition to geometrically, also
parametrically frustrated.

Abstract: We study strongly correlated fractional topological phases on a two-sphere
threaded by a magnetic dipole field with globally vanishing flux. Solving the
Dirac equation in this background produces spheroidal wavefunctions forming a
highly degenerate manifold of normalizable zero modes, with degeneracy
proportional to the total absolute flux. We introduce a non-Abelian spin gauge
field near the equator to hybridize the north and south domain-confined modes,
forming a global flat band. Projecting interactions into this band yields
Laughlin-type correlated states. The entanglement spectrum shows a chiral tower
consistent with a virtual edge, demonstrating bulk-edge correspondence in a
closed geometry. This generalizes the zero-flux flat-band construction of
\cite{Parhizkar:2024som} to curved backgrounds, with potential applications to
synthetic and astrophysical systems.

Abstract: Entanglement underpins quantum information processing and computing, yet its
experimental quantification in complex, many-body condensed matter systems
remains a considerable challenge. Here, we reveal a highly entangled electronic
phase proximate to a quantum metal-insulator transition, identified by resonant
inelastic x-ray scattering interferometry. This approach reveals that
entanglement across atomic sites generates characteristic interference
patterns, which our model accurately reproduces, enabling extraction of a full
entanglement spectrum and resolution of the underlying quantum states. Our
analysis of the pyrochlore iridate Nd2Ir2O7 demonstrates that the system
undergoes pronounced quantum fluctuations in its spin, orbital and charge
degrees of freedom, even in the presence of a long-range 'all-in-all-out'
antiferromagnetic order. Importantly, the observed entanglement signatures
facilitate the coexistence of multiple exotic symmetry-breaking orders.
Complementary investigations using Raman spectroscopy corroborate the presence
of these hidden orders and their emergent excitations. In particular, we
observe a two-magnon-bound state below the lowest single-magnon excitation
energy, which, together with split phonon modes, provides strong evidence for
cubic symmetry-breaking orders of magnetic origin juxtaposed with the
all-in-all-out order. Our work thus establishes a direct link between quantum
entanglement and emergent unconventional orders, opening new avenues for
investigating quantum materials.

Abstract: In this work, we have explored the Metallic-Flux Nanonucleation method to
synthesize single crystals and nanowires (diameter $\approx$ 170 nm) of
CeIn$_{3}$ and compare their properties. The effects of reduced dimensionality
were systematically investigated using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS),
Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), magnetic susceptibility, heat
capacity, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Semi-quantitative EDS analysis
revealed a Ce:In ratio of 1:3.1(1), and the SAED results confirmed that the
nanowires are polycrystalline with a cubic unit cell. Magnetic susceptibility,
specific heat, and NMR data indicated a suppression of the antiferromagnetic
transition to $T_N$ $\approx$ 2.4 K compared to the bulk value ($\approx$ 10
K). Furthermore, NMR analysis at temperatures below 2.8 K showed a reduced
quadrupole frequency, $\nu_Q$ $\approx$ 1.77(2) MHz, and provided evidence of
polycrystalline nanowires formed within the nanoporous alumina template, in
agreement with SAED results. We attribute these findings to an increasing
magnetic order frustration induced by dimensionality in CeIn$_{3}$ nanowires.

Abstract: The $RT_3$B$_2$ ($R=$Y, Lu, $T=$ Co, Os) family hosts a perfect kagome
lattice of $T$ atoms, offering an interesting platform to investigate the
interplay of electronic structure, superconductivity, and lattice dynamics.
Here, we compare two members of this family, LuOs$_3$B$_2$ and YCo$_3$B$_2$,
with similar crystallography but differing chemical composition, leading to
distinct electronic correlation strengths and spin-orbit coupling effects. We
confirm superconductivity in LuOs$_3$B$_2$ with $T_c = 4.75$K, while
YCo$_3$B$_2$ remains non-superconducting above 1.8K. First-principles estimates
of the electron-phonon coupling for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ are consistent with its
observed $T_c$ and suggest a moderate coupling strength. Both materials exhibit
kagome-derived electronic features, including quasi-flat bands, Dirac cones,
and van Hove singularities. Fermi surface calculations reveal
quasi-one-dimensional behavior along the $c$-axis in YCo$_3$B$_2$, in contrast
to the more three-dimensional Fermiology of LuOs$_3$B$_2$. Phonon calculations
for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ show imaginary modes, indicating potential lattice
instabilities. Experimental estimates of the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios
point to non-negligible electronic correlations in both compounds.

Abstract: We study spin/fermion ladder models with multipole phases, which are
traditional transverse-field-Ising phases formed by multipole moments. These
phases feature non-trivial order with zero magnetization. The multipole models
have dimer local conserved quantities that are Ising terms of spin. The Hilbert
spaces are locally fragmented into independent sectors described effectively by
{\it higher-order spin}. For dipole models, we consider two ladder geometries
and work out the phase diagrams. Different phases of the model can be
distinguished experimentally with the dynamical structure factor. Higher-order
multipole models are obtained by introducing more dimer conserved quantities.
The phases are characterized by the values of the local conserved quantities
and the transverse-Ising phases of the higher-order spin.

Abstract: The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that
generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even
closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions
thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where
thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present
aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an
example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the
one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons

Method: 采用热力学、电子自旋共振（ESR）、μ子自旋弛豫（μSR）和非弹性中子散射（INS）技术。

Result: 实验未检测到磁性有序或自旋冻结，但观察到反铁磁短程自旋关联和无能隙的代数自旋关联。

Conclusion: MgCrGaO4是一种罕见的三维经典自旋液体，具有高度简并的基态和无能隙激发，为高维阻挫量子磁体中自旋液体的研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: The three-dimensional frustrated spin lattice in MgCrGaO4, where Cr3+ ions
occupy a pyrochlore-like network, exemplifies a quantum magnet with competing
interactions, macroscopic degeneracy, and exotic low-energy excitations. Using
thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), muon spin relaxation (muSR), and
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) techniques, we observe no magnetic order or
spin freezing down to 57 mK, despite a sizable exchange interaction (J= 58 K)
between Cr3+ (S=3/2) moments and inherent site disorder. Below the
characteristic exchange energy scale, all experimental probes detect the
emergence of antiferromagnetic short-range spin correlations, corroborated by
magnetic diffuse scattering in the wave vector dependence of low-energy
magnetic excitations centered on Q = 1.5 A^-1 in inelastic neutron scattering
experiments. The low-temperature specific heat follows a near-quadratic
dependence without a gap, consistent with algebraic spin correlations. These
results establish MgCrGaO4 as a rare three-dimensional classical spin liquid
featuring a highly degenerate ground-state manifold and gapless excitations,
offering a strong impetus for the experimental realization of spin liquids in
higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets.

Motivation: 探索Haldane相在自旋和电荷自由度耦合系统中的稳定性，为实验观测提供依据。

Method: 使用密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG）方法分析Haldane相的关键特征，如长程弦序、有限自旋间隙和纠缠谱简并。

Result: 在Heisenberg梯子中，Haldane相随Hund耦合增强而持续强化；在Hubbard梯子中，SPT序在显著电荷涨落下仍存在，但受限于特定参数范围。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自旋和电荷自由度的复杂相互作用，为在费米子梯子材料中实验观测Haldane物理提供了关键标准。

Abstract: We systematically investigate the stability of the symmetry-protected
topological (SPT) Haldane phase in spin-1/2 Heisenberg and half-filled Hubbard
ladders coupled by ferromagnetic Hund's interactions. Using density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane
phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic
entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find
immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with
increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations
in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust
yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge
fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating
phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's
coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees
of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for
observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.

Motivation: 探索非线性电阻元件的噪声建模方法，并验证热力学约束下的模型一致性。

Method: 采用连续随机微分方程（白噪声）和离散马尔可夫主方程（散粒噪声）两种模型，分析热力学约束下的噪声行为。

Result: 连续模型中需使用H-K规则，噪声关系中的电导被电流电压比取代；离散模型在低电压下与连续模型一致。

Conclusion: 热力学约束下，H-K规则是噪声建模的必要条件，离散模型在低电压下与连续模型一致，验证了广义Johnson-Nyquist关系。

Abstract: We consider the modeling of a nonlinear, classical, resistive electrical
component using two models: i) a continuous description based on a stochastic
differential equation with a white thermal Gaussian noise; ii) a discrete, shot
noise model based on a Markovian master equation. We show that thermodynamics
imposes in i) the use of the H\"anggi-Klimontovich (H-K) prescription when the
noise depends on bias voltage, and implies a generalized Johnson-Nyquist
relation for the noise where the conductance is replaced by the ratio mean
current over voltage. In ii) we show that the discrete description compatible
with thermodynamics leads to the continuous one of i) with again the H-K
prescription. Here the generalized Johnson-Nyquist relation for noise is
recovered only at low voltage, when the continuous description is valid.

Method: 将问题映射到非线性Helmoltz方程，构建凸泛函的最小化解，再通过迭代更新逼近精确解。

Result: 经验证，仅需1-2次迭代即可收敛，算法稳健、精确且快速。

Conclusion: 提供了一种高效可靠的方法，用于研究量子纳米电子器件中的静电效应。

Abstract: The convergence of iterative schemes to achieve self-consistency in mean
field problems such as the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation is notoriously
capricious. It is particularly difficult in regimes where the non-linearities
are strong such as when an electron gas in partially depleted or in presence of
a large magnetic field. Here, we address this problem by mapping the
self-consistent quantum-electrostatic problem onto a Non-Linear Helmoltz (NLH)
equation at the cost of a small error. The NLH equation is a generalization of
the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We show that one can build iterative schemes
that are provably convergent by constructing a convex functional whose minimum
is the seeked solution of the NLH problem. In a second step, the approximation
is lifted and the exact solution of the initial problem found by iteratively
updating the NLH problem until convergence. We show empirically that
convergence is achieved in a handfull, typically one or two, iterations. Our
set of algorithms provide a robust, precise and fast scheme for studying the
effect of electrostatics in quantum nanoelectronic devices.

Abstract: The Quantum Twisting Microscope (QTM) is a groundbreaking instrument that
enables energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of quantum phases via
tunneling spectroscopy across twistable van der Waals heterostructures. In this
work, we significantly enhance the QTMs resolution and extend its measurement
capabilities to higher energies and twist angles by incorporating hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) as a tunneling dielectric. This advancement unveils
previously inaccessible signatures of the dispersion in the tunneling between
two monolayer graphene (MLG) sheets, features consistent with a logarithmic
correction to the linear Dirac dispersion arising from electron-electron (e-e)
interactions with a fine-structure constant of alpha = 0.32. Remarkably, we
find that this effect, for the first time, can be resolved even at room
temperature, where these corrections are extremely faint. Our results
underscore the exceptional resolution of the QTM, which, through
interferometric interlayer tunneling, can amplify even subtle modifications to
the electronic band structure of two-dimensional materials. Our findings reveal
that strong e-e interactions persist even in symmetric, nonordered graphene
states and emphasize the QTMs unique ability to probe spectral functions and
their excitations of strongly correlated ground states across a broad range of
twisted and untwisted systems.

Abstract: Topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) are topologically protected insulating
states induced not by single-particle band inversions, but by the Kondo
interaction between itinerant electrons and a lattice of local magnetic
moments. Although experiments have suggested the emergence of three-dimensional
(3D) TKIs in the rare earth compound SmB6, its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart
has not been demonstrated to date. Here we report experimental evidence of a
TKI in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers, which support a Kondo lattice
with topologically nontrivial Kondo interactions. We prepare in a dual-gated
device a triangular lattice Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer Kondo-coupled to
a half-filled itinerant band in the WSe2 layer. Combined transport and
compressibility measurements show that the prepared state supports metallic
transport at high temperatures and, at low temperatures, an insulating bulk
with conducting helical edge states protected by spin-Sz conservation. The
presence of Kondo singlets is further evidenced by their breakdown at high
magnetic fields. Such behaviors are in stark contrast to the simple metallic
state when the Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer is depleted by gating. Our
results open the door for exploring tunable topological Kondo physics in
moir\'e materials.

Abstract: When thinned down to just a few atomic layers, the layered magnetic

challenges in synthesizing high-purity MnBi2Te4 crystals and report the
observation of a myriad of quantized topological states in high-quality
five-septuple-layer (5-SL) samples under magnetic fields up to 45 Tesla. We
show that the nontrivial topology of 5-SL MnBi2Te4, in the presence of Landau
quantization, is governed by a generalized topological index rooted in the
parity anomaly of Dirac fermions in (2+1) dimensions. The anomaly manifests as
an anomalous Landau level, giving rise to gate-tunable helical edge transport.
Our results establish high-quality MnBi2Te4 as a robust platform for exploring
emergent topological states and for advancing novel quantum device
applications.

Motivation: 反铁磁体（AFMs）在自旋电子学和谷电子学器件中具有潜力，但现有两类AFMs（altermagnets和TP对称AFMs）分别缺乏谷极化或净自旋极化。

Method: 利用TP破缺的层状铁电反铁磁体（FE-AFMs），通过其内在的铁电性质实现自旋-谷极化，并通过层间滑动调控。

Conclusion: FE-AFMs为下一代自旋和谷基信息技术提供了潜在的应用前景。

Abstract: The generation and control of spin- and valley-polarization in
antiferromagnets (AFMs) have garnered increasing attention due to their
potential for enabling faster and more stable multifunctional spintronic and
valleytronic memory and logic devices. However, the two primary categories of
AFMs, altermagnets and TP-symmetric AFMs, either lack intrinsic
valley-polarization or net spin-polarization. Here, we propose an effective
approach for achieving spontaneous spin-valley polarization in TP-broken
layered ferroelectric antiferromagnets (FE-AFMs). The FE-AFMs exhibit lifted
spin degeneracy across the entire Brillouin zone, along with uncompensated spin
density of states. They combine the benefits of spin-polarization in
altermagnets with valley-polarization in TP-symmetric AFMs. Furthermore, the
FE-AFMs feature layer-dependent spin-polarization, rooted in their intrinsic
ferroelectric property, allowing for the flexible control over spin-valley
polarization by interlayer sliding. This tunability facilitates sign-reversible
and size-tunable valley Hall and Nernst effects, along with other
spin-valley-dependent transport properties. Our findings are demonstrated in a
broad class of TP-broken bilayer antiferromagnets such as Nb3X8 (X = Cl, Br,
I), VX2 (X = S, Se), and VSi2X4 (X = N, P), underscoring the potential of
FE-AFMs for advancing next-generation spin- and valley-based information
technologies.

Abstract: The exciton recombination and spin dynamics are investigated both
experimentally and theoretically in an ensemble of indirect band gap
(In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots (QDs) with type-I band alignment. The
magnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the time-integrated
photoluminescence changes sign across the emission spectrum with a width
reflecting the QD size. It is negative on the low energy side, i.e. for
emission from large QDs, but positive on the high energy side, i.e. for
emission from small QDs. However, the exciton g factor, measured by spin-flip
Raman scattering, is positive across the whole QD ensemble. The
magnetic-field-induced circular polarization of the photoluminescence dynamics
is studied as function of the magnetic field strength and direction. The
dynamics are non-monotonic over a time range up to milliseconds. The time
dependence of the photoluminescence circular polarization degree and sign
strongly depends on the emission energy and changes with magnetic field
orientation. The observed nonmonotonic behavior is provided by the interplay of
bright and dark exciton states, contributing to the emission. The experiment is
interpreted using a kinetic theory, which accounts for the dynamics of the spin
states in the exciton level quartet in longitudinal and tilted magnetic fields,
the radiative recombination processes, and the redistribution of the excitons
between these states as result of spin relaxation. The model allows us to
evaluate the electron and heavy hole spin relaxation times in QDs with
different sizes.

Abstract: Nanostructuring materials at small scales enables control over their physical
properties, revealing behaviors not observed at larger dimensions. This
strategy is particularly effective in two-dimensional (2D) materials, where
surface effects dominate, and has been applied in the thermoelectric field.
Here, we use multilayer graphene (4-6 nm thick) as a test platform to study the
effect of nanomeshing on its thermoelectric properties. The nanomesh consists
of a hexagonal array of holes, with a measured diameter and neck-width of ~360
nm and ~160 nm, respectively. The multilayer graphene is integrated into
field-effect transistor-like devices supported by hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN), allowing simultaneous electric and thermoelectric measurements, with
nanomeshing applied to only part of the material. We use modulated
thermoreflectance to investigate thermal transport in equivalent nanomeshed and
pristine graphene flakes, extracting key parameters that affect thermoelectric
performance. The nanomesh geometry suppresses thermal transport without
significantly impacting charge transport, highlighting the different scattering
lengths of phonons and electrons while enhancing the thermopower response. We
observe a twofold improvement in the device power factor, PF = S^2 sigma (with
S the Seebeck coefficient and sigma the electrical conductivity), at room
temperature, along with a nearly threefold reduction in thermal conductivity k.
The results show that nanomeshing can significantly improve the thermoelectric
performance of multilayer graphene, paving the way for novel energy conversion
strategies using 2D materials.

Abstract: Stereoisomers of C13Cl2 exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon
atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation. We resolved chiral geometries of
the closed-shell singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped helical
orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. The {\pi}-orbital basis of
the singlets twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation, which is consistent with a
half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the {\pi}-orbital basis is periodic
with respect to four circumnavigations, corresponding to a quasiparticle on a
ring with this boundary condition, implying a Berry phase of {\pi}/2. We
demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of
oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically
trivial, triplet isomer.

Abstract: Collinear antiferromagnets with nonrelativistic spin-split bands and no net
magnetization, called altermagnets, show interesting transport properties due
to their unique band structure. We here compute the linear response optical
conductivity of thin films of such materials in the presence of phonon
scatterings. Using a tight-binding lattice model for altermagnets and the
Holstein model for the phonon sector, we find that the electron-phonon
scatterings can strongly increase the spin conductivity at finite frequencies.
This occurs despite the fact that the self-energy describing the
electron-phonon interactions is spin-independent. Interestingly, we show that
electron-phonon scattering also enhances the spin-splitter effect at finite
frequencies. These results suggest that altermagnets with strong
electron-phonon coupling are favorable with regard to AC spin-polarized
transport.

Abstract: Generation of magnon polarons, which are hybridized states resulting from
strong magnon-phonon coupling, is a key to enabling coherent manipulation in
acoustic and spintronic devices. However, the conventional device
configuration, a magnetic thin film on a thick piezoelectric layer, often has
difficulty achieving a large magnon-phonon coupling due to a very small spatial
mode overlap. Here, we demonstrate generation of magnon polarons by using a
mode-matched on-chip magnomechanical system. A configuration with a thin
piezoelectric film on a magnetic layer several micrometers thick was found to
sustain deeply distributed magnon modes that enable magnetoelastic coupling to
phonons over almost the entire mode volume. The enhanced spatial mode overlap
generated magnon polarons whose spectra showed distinct avoided crossing. This
magnomechanical system will facilitate utilization of coherent magnon-phonon
conversion and their hybrid states in functional phononic devices.

Abstract: We analytically and numerically investigate an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer
with two superconducting terminals and a strongly correlated quantum dot in one
arm. Through a rigorous derivation, we prove that this double-path
interferometer is spectrally equivalent to a simpler system: an interacting
quantum dot coupled to a non-interacting side-coupled proximitized mode and a
semiconductor lead. This equivalence reveals a simple interpretation of the
interferometer's behavior through the competition of a geometric factor $\chi$,

Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments probing the wavefunctions of magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG), we perform large-scale first-principles
calculations of tBLG with full atomic relaxation across a wide range of twist
angles down to $0.99^\circ$. Focusing on the magic angle, we compute
wavefunctions of the low energy bands, resolving atomic-scale details and
moir\'e-scale patterns that form triangular, honeycomb, and Kagome lattices. By
tuning the interlayer interactions, we illustrate the formation of the flat
bands from isolated monolayers and the emergence of the band inversion and
fragile topology at a sufficiently large interaction strength. We identify
strong indicators of a new topological phase transition with increasing
interlayer interaction strength, achievable with external pressure or a
decrease in the twist angle. When this transition occurs, the upper and lower
flat bands exchange their wavefunction character, which may explain why
superconductivity appears with electron doping below the magic angle. Our study
demonstrates the feasibility of using first-principles wavefunctions to help
interpret experimental signatures of topological and correlated phases in tBLG.

the AOC effects on tunnel rates are incorporated in an exact manner.

Abstract: We present a non-Hermitian model with gain/loss and non-reciprocal
next-nearest-neighbor hopping that emulates black-hole physics. The model
describes a one-dimensional lattice with a smooth connection between regions
with distinct hopping parameters. By mapping the system to an effective
Schwarzschild metric in the Painlev\'e-Gullstrand coordinates, we find that the
interface is analogue to a black-hole event horizon. We obtain emission rates
for particles and antiparticles, the Hawking temperature, the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and the mass of the analogue black hole as a
function of the interface sharpness and the system parameters. An experimental
realization of the theoretical model is proposed, thus opening the way to the
detection of elusive black-hole features.

Abstract: Exciton transport in 2D semiconductors holds promise for room-temperature,
ultra-compact optoelectronic devices, but it is limited by short propagation
distances. Hybridization of excitons with cavity photons to form
exciton-polaritons can enhance the propagation by orders of magnitude, enabling
a coherent, ballistic transport. However, a microscopic understanding of the
role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the
crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here,
we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in \ce{MoSe2} monolayers
at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated
coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct
transport regimes: (i) an initial sub-ps ballistic-like regime characterized by
a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-ps
superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a
slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization. The gained
microscopic insights will trigger and guide future experimental studies on the
phonon-mediated polariton transport in atomically thin semiconductors.

Abstract: Integrating ferroelectricity, antiferromagnetism, and topological quantum
transport within a single material is rare, but crucial for developing
next-generation quantum devices. Here, we propose a multiferroic
heterostructure consisting of an antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer and
an Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film is able to harbor the half-quantized Hall (HQH) effect
with a ferroelectrically switchable Hall conductivity of $e^2/2h$. We first
show that, in the energetically stable configuration, the antiferromagnetic
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer opens a gap in the top surface bands of Sb$_2$Te$_3$
through proximity effect, while its bottom surface bands remain gapless;
consequently, HQH conductivity of $e^2/2h$ can be sustained clockwise or
counterclockwise depending on antiferromagnetic configuration of the
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Remarkably, when applying interlayer sliding within the
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ bilayer, its electric polarization direction associated with
parity-time reversal symmetry breaking is reversed, accompanied by a reversal
of the HQH conductivity. The proposed approach offers a powerful route to
control topological quantum transport in antiferromagnetic materials by
ferroelectricity.

Abstract: We show that the integer quantum Hall transition in a disordered nanowire
with orbital momentum-space texture connected to four terminals is accompanied
by an orbital Hall transition. We applied a multifractal detrended fluctuation
analysis and found that both conductance fluctuations in the integer quantum
Hall transition (IQHT) and orbital-conductance fluctuations in the orbital Hall
transition (OHT) display multifractal behavior. We argue that this
multifractality is primarily related to disorder, which gives rise to the
strong fluctuations that are fingerprints of IQHT and OHT, but is also a
consequence of the fact that the nanowire has finite size, which causes a
weakening of the multifractality in a certain range of values of disorder
strength followed by a new regime of increasing multifractality with increasing
disorder strength. Furthermore, our findings indicate that OHT can bring novel
insights to future IQHT analysis.

Abstract: Friction causes mechanical energy dissipation and material degradation in
machinery and devices. While phononic friction is well understood via
anharmonic lattice dynamics, the physics of electronic friction remains unclear
due to challenges in separating electronic degrees of freedom from phononic
ones in experiments and analyzing the non-equilibrium interactions between
ionic movement and electronic dynamics in theory. To tackle this problem, we
construct a sliding device featuring 2D crystalline interfaces that possess
ultra-smooth and minimally interacting surfaces, achieving the state of
structural superlubricity with no wear and minimal friction. Using electrical
and mechanical controls, we tuned the nature of interfacial electronic coupling
and charge densities in materials in an on-device setting, which allows us to
disentangle the electron and phonon contributions to friction. Our experimental
data and theoretical analysis supported by first-principles calculations
demonstrate that electronic friction can well surpass phononic contributions
and dominate energy dissipation at structural superlubricity contacts. These
findings offer fresh insights into the mechanism of electronic friction and
promising opportunities for friction control in device applications.

Conclusion: MnBi2Te4/Sb2Te3是实现高温HQAH效应的理想平台，其霍尔电导的平稳性由无带隙带的独特贡献决定。

Abstract: The classic Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs theorem dictates that a single
electron band of a lattice can only harbor an integer quantum Hall conductance
as a multiple of e^2/2h, while recent studies have pointed to the emergence of
half quantum anomalous Hall (HQAH) effect, though the underlying microscopic
mechanisms remain controversial. Here we propose an ideal platform of
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/Sb$_2$Te$_3$ that allows not only to realize the HQAH effect at
much higher temperatures, but also to critically assess the different
contributions of the gapped and gapless Dirac bands. We first show that the top
surface bands of the Sb$_2$Te$_3$ film become gapped, while the bottom surface
bands remain gapless due to proximity coupling with the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$
overlayer. Next we show that such a semi-magnetic topological insulator harbors
the HQAH effect at ~20 K, with Cr doping enhancing it to as high as 67 K,
driven by large magnetic anisotropy and strong magnetic coupling constants that
raise the Curie temperature. Our detailed Berry curvature analysis further
helps to reveal that, whereas the gapped surface bands can contribute to the
Hall conductance when the chemical potential is tuned to overlap with the
bands, these bands have no net contribution when the chemical potential is in
the gapped region, leaving the gapless bands to be the sole contributor to the
HQAH conductance. Counterintuitively, the part of the gapless bands within the
gapped region of the top surface bands have no net contribution, thereby
ensuring the plateau nature of the Hall conductance.

Abstract: Electrons trapped above the surface of helium provide a means to study
many-body physics free from the randomness that comes from defects in other
condensed-matter systems. Localizing an electron in an electrostatic quantum
dot makes its energy spectrum discrete, with controlled level spacing. The
lowest two states can act as charge qubit states. In this paper, we study how
the coupling to the quantum field of capillary waves on helium -- ripplons --
affects electron dynamics. As we show, the coupling can be strong. This bounds
the parameter range where electron-based charge qubits can be implemented. The
constraint is different from the conventional relaxation time constraint. The
electron-ripplon system in a dot is similar to a color center formed by an
electron defect coupled to phonons in a solid. In contrast to solids, the
coupling in the electron on helium system can be varied from strong to weak.
This enables a qualitatively new approach to studying color center physics. We
analyze the spectroscopy of the pertinent synthetic color centers in a broad
range of the coupling strength

Abstract: Altermagnets offer a promising platform for dissipationless spin transport by
combining zero net magnetization with spontaneous non-relativistic spin
splitting. However, their magnonic transport properties remain largely
unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum-kinetic theory for thermally driven
magnon currents that cleanly separates Berry-curvature-driven intrinsic
contributions from Drude-like scattering-dependent terms. Applying this
framework to a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with anisotropic
next-nearest-neighbor exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we reveal
spin-split magnon bands that support both intrinsic and extrinsic spin Nernst
and Seebeck currents. For realistic parameters, we predict a sizable magnon
spin-splitting angle (about 3.3 degrees) and a pure transverse spin current
capable of exerting a strong spin-splitter torque suitable for magnetization
switching.

Abstract: The quantum metric, a key component of quantum geometry, plays a central role
in a wide range of physical phenomena and has been extensively studied in
periodic crystals and moir\'{e} materials. Here, we systematically investigate
quantum geometry in one-dimensional (1D) quasiperiodic systems and uncover
novel properties that fundamentally distinguish them from both periodic
crystals and disordered media. Our comparative analysis reveals that
quasiperiodicity significantly enhances the quantum metric -- despite the
absence of translational symmetry -- due to the presence of critical
wavefunctions with long-range spatial correlations. In the
Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, we show that the quantum metric serves as a
sensitive probe of localization transitions, exhibiting sharp changes at the
critical point and distinct behaviors near mobility edges. In the Fibonacci
chain, characterized by a singular continuous spectrum, we discover an
anomalous enhancement of the quantum metric when the Fermi level lies within
the minimal gaps of the fractal energy spectrum. Using a perturbative
renormalization group framework, we trace this enhancement to the hierarchical
structure of the spectrum and the bonding-antibonding nature of critical states
across narrow gaps. Our findings establish a fundamental connection between
wavefunction criticality, spectral fractality, and quantum geometry, suggesting
quasiperiodic systems as promising platforms for engineering enhanced quantum
geometric properties beyond conventional crystalline paradigms.

Abstract: We introduce a new class of tunable periodic structures, formed by launching
two obliquely propagating surface acoustic waves on a piezoelectric substrate
that supports a two-dimensional quantum material. The resulting acoustoelectric
superlattice exhibits two salient features. First, its periodicity is widely
tunable, spanning a length scale intermediate between moir\'e superlattices and
optical lattices, enabling the formation of narrow, topologically nontrivial
energy bands. Second, unlike moir\'e systems, where the superlattice amplitude
is set by intrinsic interlayer tunneling and lattice relaxation, the amplitude
of the acoustoelectric potential is externally tunable via the surface acoustic
wave power. Using massive monolayer graphene as an example, we demonstrate that
varying the frequencies and power of the surface acoustic waves enables in-situ
control over the band structure of the 2D material, generating flat bands and
nontrivial valley Chern numbers, featuring a highly localized Berry curvature.

Spatially indirect excitons (IXs) are composed of electrons and holes in

and travel long distances. In this work, we measured IX transport in a
MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure by time-resolved
photoluminescence imaging. These measurements probe the kinetics of IX cloud
expansion and reveal the transport characteristics. We found IX transport with
anomalously high diffusivity, orders of magnitude higher than for regular
diffusive exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures. This efficient
IX transport agrees with long-range ballistic transport and is consistent with
the Bose-Hubbard theory prediction of superfluid in moire superlattices.

Conclusion: Bi₂O₂Se是研究隐藏Rashba效应和自旋电子学的理想平台。

Abstract: Quantized conductance in quasi-one-dimensional systems not only provides a
hallmark of ballistic transport, but also serves as a gateway for exploring
quantum phenomena. Recently, a unique hidden Rashba effect attracts tremendous
attention, which arises from the compensation of opposite spin polarizations of
a Rashba bilayer in inversion symmetric crystals with dipole fields, such as
bismuth oxyselenide ($\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$). However,
investigating this effect utilizing conductance quantization is still
challenging. Here we report the conductance quantization observed in a chemical
vapor deposition (CVD)-grown high-mobility
$\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}\mathrm{Se}$ nanoribbon, where quantized
conductance plateaus up to $44\cdot 2e^{2}/{h}$ ($e$ is the elementary charge,
$h$ is the Planck constant, and the factor $2$ results from spin degeneracy)
are achieved at zero magnetic field. Due to the hidden Rashba effect, the
quantized conductance remains in multiples of $2e^{2}/{h}$ without Zeeman
splitting even under magnetic field up to $12$ T. Moreover, within a specific
range of magnetic field, the plateau sequence exhibits the Pascal triangle

Abstract: Recently, moir\'e superlattices have been found on the surface of topological
insulators due to the rotational misalignment of topmost layers. In this work,
we study the effects of moir\'e superlattices on the Landau levels of
topological surface states. We find that an extra Zeeman term besides the
intrinsic one can be induced by the orbital effect of the magnetic field in
moir\'e surface states. As a result, the originally field-independent zeroth
Landau level of moir\'e surface states could be tilted by the out-of-plane
magnetic field.

Conclusion: hNPG的输运特性可通过设计控制，为纳米电子学和光电器件提供了新思路。

Abstract: Bottom-up on-surface synthesized nanoporous graphenes (NPGs), realized as 2D
arrays of laterally covalently bonded pi-conjugated graphene nanoribbons
(GNRs), are a family of carbon nanomaterials which are receiving increasing
attention for nanoelectronics and biosensing. Recently, a so-called hybrid-NPG
(hNPG) was synthesized, featuring an alternating sequence of doped and
non-doped GNRs, resulting in a band staggering effect in its electronic
structure. Such a feature is appealing for photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and
even carbon nanocircuitry. However, to date, little is known about the
transport properties of hNPG and its derivatives, which is key for most
applications. Here, via Green's functions simulations, we study the quantum
transport properties of hNPGs. We find that injected carriers in hNPG spread
laterally through a number of GNRs, though such spreading may take place
exclusively through GNRs of one type (doped or non-doped). We propose a simple
model to discern the key parameters determining the electronic propagation in
hNPGs and explore alternative hNPG designs to control the spreading/confinement
and anisotropy of charge transport in these systems. For one such design, we
find that it is possible to send directed electric signals with sub-nanometer
precision for as long as one micrometer - a result first reported for any NPG.

Result: 数字合金化使自旋轨道耦合改变高达138 meVÅ，主要源于界面Rashba效应的变化。

Conclusion: 数字合金化是一种有效调控量子阱自旋轨道耦合的方法，对相关应用具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Increasing the spin-orbit coupling in InGaAs quantum wells is desirable for
applications involving spintronics and topological quantum computing. Digital
alloying is an approach towards growing ternary quantum wells that enables
asymmetric interfaces and compositional grading in the quantum well, which can
potentially modify the spin-orbit coupling in the quantum well. The spin-orbit
coupling of the quantum wells is extracted from beating patterns in the low
magnetic field magnetoresistance. Digital alloying is found to modify the
spin-orbit coupling by up to 138 meV\textnormal{\AA}. The changes induced in
the spin-orbit coupling can be qualitatively understood as being due to
modifications in the interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: Hole spin qubits in Ge/GeSi heterostructures benefit from the clean
environment of epitaxial interfaces and from the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling
that enables efficient electrical control, which makes them promising
candidates for quantum computation. However, spin-orbit coupling also enhances
the sensitivity to electrical disorder, potentially increasing variability. In
this work, we perform numerical simulations in a realistic device geometry to
quantify the variability of the charge and spin properties of Ge qubits induced
by charge traps at the SiGe/oxide interfaces. We show that while the
variability of charge properties remains moderate, spin properties (g-factors
and Rabi frequencies) show significant dispersion. We explore the implications
of this variability for large-scale architectures, and provide guidelines to
minimize variability both in terms of interface quality requirements and
optimal operation strategies.

Abstract: We observe momentum transfer in the ponderomotive potential of near-infrared
(NIR) laser pulses in time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(tr-ARPES) experiments with ultrashort extreme ultraviolet probe pulses.
Acceleration of photoelectrons in the transient grating provided by an intense
laser pulse reflected at a surface leads to delay-dependent oscillations of
electric kinetic energies. Photon and electron momenta determine the
oscillation frequency. We experimentally observe and theoretically simulate
electron yield modulations driven by a novel electron-energy bunching effect.
Measurement results are simulated and fitted with high accuracy. Complete
reversion of the ponderomotive momentum transfer allows for retrieval of the
undisturbed initial state and the transient band structure for overlapping pump
and probe pulses.

Conclusion: 该几何效应可通过现有技术在超冷原子、飞秒光子波导和应变半导体纳米卷等平台中验证。

Abstract: We introduce a mesoscopic quantum well whose confinement and chirality emerge
solely from the intrinsic torsion of a finite helicoidal metric. This purely
geometric construction requires no external gates or fields: the metric itself
induces both a harmonic radial potential and a torsion-driven Zeeman term that
breaks the $m \leftrightarrow -m$ degeneracy. By imposing hard-wall boundary
conditions at $z = \pm L/2$, we quantize the axial motion and obtain a
genuinely zero-dimensional helicoidal quantum dot. An exact analytic solution
reveals an energy spectrum with chiral splitting linear in both the torsion
parameter $\Omega$ and the axial quantum number $n_z$. For realistic InAs
nanoroll parameters ($L = 100$ nm, $\Omega = 5\times10^{6} \mathrm{m^{-1}}$),
this geometric effect results in a measurable splitting of $\sim 0.5$ meV. We
propose three viable experimental platforms, ultracold atoms in optical traps,
femtosecond-written photonic waveguides, and strain-engineered semiconductor
nanorolls, where this torsion-induced phenomenon should be accessible with
current technology.

Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence, which relates topological properties of a
material in the bulk to the presence of robust modes localized on the edge, is
at the core of the now mature field of topological wave physics. More recently,
it was realized that in crystalline structures, certain types of defects can
host localized modes, in which case the bulk-boundary correspondence has to be
replaced by a bulk-defect correspondence. These defect-localized modes are
expected to have robust properties owing to their topological origin. In this
work, we show how to obtain topological defect modes in a lattice possessing
both mirror and chiral symmetry. The defect is obtained by endowing a plaquette
with a non-trivial gauge flux. We show that the bulk-defect correspondence is
satisfied by introducing appropriate topological invariants. Moreover, the
topological defect modes are shown to be highly robust to the introduction of
symmetry-preserving disorder. The model is then realized in an acoustic system
made of a network of tubes, and the presence of topological defect mode is
experimentally clearly demonstrated.

Abstract: The presence of low-energy valley excitations in Si/SiGe heterostructures
often causes spin qubits to fail. It is therefore important to develop robust
protocols for characterizing the valley coupling. Here, we show that
realistically sized samplings of valley energy distributions tend to
dramatically overestimate the average valley coupling. But we find that
knowledge of the valley phase, in addition to the valley splitting, can
significantly improve our estimates. Motivated by this understanding, we
propose a novel method to probe the valley phase landscape across the quantum
well using simple $g$-factor measurements. An important calibration step in
this procedure is to measure $g$ in a loop enclosing a valley vortex, where the
valley phase winds by $\pm 2\pi$ around a zero of the valley splitting. This
proposal establishes an important new tool for probing spin qubits, and it can
be implemented in current experiments.

Result: 高缺陷密度和缺陷间距减小是表面态位移和间隙抑制的主要原因。

Conclusion: 研究为拓扑量子材料的进一步开发提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The topological magnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT), with gapped topological surface
state, is an attractive platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall and Axion
insulator states. However, the experimentally observed surface state gaps fail
to meet theoretical predictions, although the exact mechanism behind the gap
suppression has been debated. Recent theoretical studies suggest that intrinsic
antisite defects push the topological surface state away from the MBT surface,
closing its gap and making it less accessible to scanning probe experiments.
Here, we report on the local effect of defects on the MBT surface states and
demonstrate that high defect concentrations lead to a displacement of the
surface states well into the MBT crystal, validating the theorized mechanism.
The local and global influence of antisite defects on the topological surface
states are studied with samples of varying defect densities by combining
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), and
density functional theory (DFT). Our findings identify a combination of
increased defect density and reduced defect spacing as the primary factors
underlying the displacement of the surface states and suppression of surface
gap, shedding light to further development of topological quantum materials.

Abstract: Distinguished by their long lifetimes, strong dipolar interactions, and
periodic confinement, moir\'e excitons provide a fertile territory for
realizing interaction-driven excitonic phases beyond conventional semiconductor
systems. Formed in twisted or lattice-mismatched van der Waals
heterostructures, these excitons are shaped by a periodic potential landscape
that enables the engineering of flat bands, strong interactions, and long-lived
localised states. This has opened pathways to explore strongly correlated
phases, including excitonic insulators, superfluids, and supersolids,
potentially stable even at room temperature. When embedded in optical cavities,
moir\'e excitons hybridize with photons to form moir\'e exciton-polaritons, a
new class of quasiparticles exhibiting enhanced optical nonlinearities and
novel topological features.
  In this review, we survey the theoretical foundations and experimental
progress in the field of moir\'e excitons and polaritons. We begin by
introducing the formation mechanisms of moir\'e patterns in two-dimensional
semiconductors, and describe their impact on exciton confinement, optical
selection rules, and spin-valley physics. We then discuss recent advances in
the realization of many-body excitonic phases and exciton-based probes of
electronic correlations. Finally, we explore the novel aspects of moir\'e
polaritons, highlighting their unique nonlinear and topological properties. By
bridging quantum optics, nanophotonics, and correlated electron systems,
moir\'e excitons offer a powerful solid-state platform for quantum simulation,
optoelectronic applications, and many-body photonics.

Abstract: Polarizability plays an essential role in characterizing the key phenomena,
such as the screening effects, collective excitations, and dielectric functions
present in the system. In this study, we investigate the intraband and
interband polarizability within the random phase approximation for the
three-dimensional nodal line semimetals, specifically for Ca$_3$P$_2$ and
ZrSiS. We find both intraband and interband contributions show tunable behavior
with the chemical potential, which adds a resonance signature in the behavior
of the polarizability. Further, in the long wavelength limit, the results
reveal the quadratic dependence on the wave vector by the non-resonant
intraband and interband parts of the polarizability. On the other hand, the
resonant interband part gives a cubic dependence on the wave vector. In
addition, the total polarizability is dominated by the intraband part in the
low frequency regime, while in the mid and high frequency regimes, the
interband part takes the lead. This study opens avenues for further theoretical
and experimental exploration of frequency dependent dielectric properties,
paving the way for potential applications in tunable plasmonic devices.
