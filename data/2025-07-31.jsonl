While much progress has been made toward the realization of a\nfully digital, scalable, and fault tolerant quantum computer, there are still\nmany essential challenges to overcome. In the interim, direct emulation of\nquantum systems of interest can fill an important gap not only for exploring\nfundamental questions about many-body physics and the quantum to classical\ntransition, but also for potentially providing alternative methods to verify\nresults from quantum simulations. In this work we will demonstrate a method\nutilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble\nof cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin\nsystem Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are\nable to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to\nexplore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales. Moreover,\ncontrolling the number of atoms in the collective spin can potentially allow us\nto investigate these dynamics in the transition from fully quantum to the\nclassical limit. In particular, we emulate two models: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick\n(LMG) Hamiltonian, and a closely related model, the Kicked Top. In the former\ncase, we show that our system undergoes a symmetry-breaking phase transition in\nthe expected parameter regime. In the latter, we explore two interesting\naspects: the formation of chaos, and a dynamically driven time crystal phase.\nWe will then discuss the advantages and limits of this approach."}

Based on this idea Bell constructed an inequality whereby\nexperimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and\nlocal-realistic theories. Many experiments have since been done that are\nconsistent with quantum mechanics, disproving the concept of local realism. But\nall these tests suffered from loopholes allowing a local-realistic explanation\nof the experimental observations. In this context, of special interest is\nentanglement between different quantum objects like atoms and photons, because\nit allows one to entangle distant atoms by the interference of photons. The\nresulting space-like separation together with the almost perfect detection\nefficiency of the atoms will allow a first event-ready Bell test closing\ndetection and locality loopholes.\n  The primary goal of the present thesis was the experimental realization of\nentanglement between a single localized atom and a single spontaneously emitted\nphoton. In the experiment a single optically trapped R87 atom is excited to a\nstate which has two selected decay channels. In the following spontaneous decay\na photon is emitted coherently with equal probability into both decay channels.\nThis accounts for perfect correlations between the polarization state of the\nemitted photon and the Zeeman state of the atom after spontaneous decay.\nBecause these decay channels are spectrally and in all other degrees of freedom\nindistinguishable, the spin state of the atom is entangled with the\npolarization state of the photon. To verify entanglement, appropriate\ncorrelation measurements in complementary bases of the photon polarization and\nthe internal quantum state of the atom were performed. It is shown, that the\ngenerated atom-photon state yields an entanglement fidelity of 0.82."}

Here, I propose a promising mechanism to explain the emergence\nof the thermal Hall effect in these systems: axial chiral phonon skew\nscattering mediated by orbital magnetization. Starting from basic principles, I\nderive the form and magnitude of the orbital magnetization-phonon coupling\nusing the well-established Haldane model. Using this coupling, I calculate the\nthermal Hall conductivity and Hall angle as functions of temperature, achieving\nsemi-quantitative agreement with experimental findings. This work enhances our\nunderstanding of the role of electron-phonon coupling in thermal transport and\nprovides a pathway to tailor thermal properties in a broad range of materials."}

On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is\nmoved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask\nhow to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the\nunitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit\nconstrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for\nsymmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome,\nwhich we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines\nthe symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast,\nfor unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the\nCheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full\ndescription. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator\nrepresentations play an important role in our discussion."}

Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order\ntopological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different\nhigher-order topological states in a single $d$-dimensional ($d$D) system. Such\ntopological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is\ndifferent from first-order topological states, higher-order topological states,\nand the coexistence of both. Remarkably, we develop a generic surface theory to\nprecisely capture them and firstly discover a $3$D unconventional HyOTI\nprotected by inversion symmetry, which renders both second-order (helical) and\nthird-order (corner) topological states in one band gap and exhibits a novel\nbulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we\nalso observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric\nHyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based\nexperimental scheme to detect these interesting results.

As in\nconventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so\nfar has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate\nthe nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and\nthe Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions.\nClarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to\nobtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both\ngenerally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler\nclass. Focusing on three-band $\\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two\ndimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the\npossible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We\nestablish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns\naccording to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant,\nhighlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by\nbuilding upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical\nconsequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice\nEuler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically\nconfirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss\npossible experimental implementations.
