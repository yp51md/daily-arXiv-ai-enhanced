We apply DQI to the Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI)\nproblem, whose dual code is Reed-Solomon (RS). We establish that DQI for OPI is\nthe first known candidate for verifiable quantum advantage with optimal\nasymptotic speedup: solving instances with classical hardness $O(2^N)$ requires\nonly $\\widetilde{O}(N)$ quantum gates, matching the theoretical lower bound.\nRealizing this speedup requires highly efficient reversible RS decoders. We\nintroduce novel quantum circuits for the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, the\ndecoder's bottleneck. Our techniques, including a new representation for\nimplicit B\\'ezout coefficient access, and optimized in-place architectures,\nreduce the leading-order space complexity to the theoretical minimum of $2nb$\nqubits while significantly lowering gate counts. These improvements are broadly\napplicable, including to Shor's algorithm for the discrete logarithm. We\nanalyze OPI over binary extension fields $GF(2^b)$, assess hardness against new\nclassical attacks, and identify resilient instances. Our resource estimates\nshow that classically intractable OPI instances (requiring $>10^{23}$ classical\ntrials) can be solved with approximately 5.72 million Toffoli gates. This is\nsubstantially less than the count required for breaking RSA-2048, positioning\nDQI as a compelling candidate for practical, verifiable quantum advantage."}

Most ensemble-based realizations rely on dark-state polaritons\n(DSPs) in $\\Lambda$-type systems that operate at near-infrared wavelengths,\nsuch as 795 nm in $^{87}$Rb, far from the telecom band where long fiber\ntransmission is optimal. Here we identify a DSP in $^{87}$Rb that coherently\ncouples two photonic modes at 795 nm and 1324 nm through a shared spin-wave\ncoherence. We derive its field operator and group velocity, extending the\nFleischhauer-Lukin model to a dual-wavelength regime, and formulate a memory\nprotocol enabling bidirectional storage and retrieval between the two modes.\nNumerical simulations of the full six-level dynamics confirm two-way storage\nand retrieval for both same-mode and cross-mode operation between the two\nwavelengths.

We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and\ngeneral decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of\nstabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our\narchitecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of\nstabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations\nto build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves\nsubstantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a\ndedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across\nvarious code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural\nnetwork-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with\nordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline.

We show that even when these perturbations break the\nsymmetry and lead to a single steady state, the phase correlations in the\nresulting state exhibit signatures of synchronization.

For a range of Hamiltonians and considering second-order formulas,\nwe demonstrate that this Monte Carlo-based bound is often extremely tight, and\neven exact in some instances.
