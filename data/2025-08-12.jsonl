Recently, nonsymmorphic centrosymmetric crystals have been\nidentified as a broad class of materials which could exhibit unit-cell doubling\nmagnetism with odd-parity spin-polarization.

We first demonstrate that the\nsymmetry conditions which permit a p-wave spin polarization pattern also permit\nthe existence of a non-relativistic Lifshitz invariant in the phenomenological\nGinzburg-Landau free energy. This implies magnetism with an incommensurate\nordering vector, independent of its microscopic origin. AFMs with f- or h-wave\nspin-polarization are also prone to incommensurability, especially when they\nhave an itinerant origin. Here the symmetry which ensures the odd-parity\nspin-polarization also guarantees the existence of van Hove saddle points off\nthe time-reversal-invariant momenta, which promote incommensurate spin\nfluctuations in quasi-two-dimensional electronic systems. Finally, we study the\neffect of weak spin-orbit coupling in locally noncentrosymmetric materials and\nfind that it favors antiferromagnetic phases with in-plane magnetic moments.\nHowever, the inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling also introduces a new\nmechanism for driving incommensuration.

In contrast to the classic\nmodel of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation\ntransition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by\npushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing\nability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of\na rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we\ndemonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the\nBalagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival\nprobability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits\nstretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average\ntrap size as a proxy, we identify a new trapping transition that replaces the\nclassical percolation transition. This transition occurs at a threshold density\n$\\rho_* \\approx 0.55$ and separates two qualitatively distinct trapping\nregimes: a self-trapping regime at low density, where the walker becomes\ndynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping\nregime at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement\nof obstacles."}

In an\nin-plane field, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ follows the\ncubic temperature dependence to low temperatures, manifesting the ideal Dirac\nsemimetal with chemical potential close to the Dirac point. In an out-of-plane\nfield, $1/T_1$ becomes a constant below 20 K, where the Laudau level appears,\nand is enhanced more than 100 times larger than under the in-plane field.

In a semiconductor laser, squeezing\nto below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity\nand it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to\nsqueezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but\noften the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier.\nAt the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle.
