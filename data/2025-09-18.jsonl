Starting from R\\'enyi and\nTsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to\nthe conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly\ndeviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be\nmapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft\nreparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi\nGolden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional\nFermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity\nat high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze\nmagnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle\nconsistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low\ntemperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover\nFermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled\ninterpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively\nlinking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable\ntransport coefficients in strange metals."}

We take Mn2WS4 as an example to reveal that the axial Hall\neffect originates from the interplay between Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling\nand the intrinsic piezomagnetic response of Lieb-lattice altermagnets, leading\nto highly localized and enhanced Berry curvature. Remarkably, the magnitude of\nthe axial Hall effect is significant and remains unchanged when varying the\nstrain, highlighting the topological nature of the axial degree of freedom.\nFinally, in multilayer systems, the effect manifests as a distinctive\nthickness-dependent modulation of both anomalous and spin Hall responses.

Such term\ncompensates for the distortion of the system's potential due to the finite\ncoupling to the environment. Even if the coupling is weak, the counter term is,\nin general, not negligible. Similarly, weak-coupling master equations feature a\nnumber of `Lamb-shift terms' which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be\nneglected. Yet, the practice of vanishing both counter term and Lamb shift when\ndealing with master equations is almost universal; and, surprisingly, it can\nyield better results. By accepting the conventional wisdom, one may approximate\nthe dynamics more accurately and, importantly, the resulting master equation is\nguaranteed to equilibrate to the correct steady state in the high-temperature\nlimit. In this paper we discuss why is this the case. Specifically, we show\nthat, if the potential distortion is small -- but non-negligible -- the counter\nterm does not influence any dissipative processes to second order in the\ncoupling. Furthermore, we show that, for large environmental cutoff, the\nLamb-shift terms approximately cancel any coherent effects due to the counter\nterm -- this renders the combination of both contributions irrelevant in\npractice.

Our results show that in both distinct (local) and\ncommon bath scenarios, nonlocal correlations initially grow from zero, reach a\npeak, and then decay. In the case of local baths, the decay is smooth and\nmonotonic; although the peak value increases with temperature, its temporal\nwidth (measured via the full width at half maximum) decreases, indicating a\nshorter duration of nonlocal correlations.

These solutions exist in a wide range of\nelectromagnetic 4-potentials and fields, which are explicitly calculated. In\naddition, we describe a method for controlling the transverse spatial\ndistribution of Weyl particles and separating them according to their helicity\nand direction of motion using suitable magnetic fields."}

Starting from R\\'enyi and\nTsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to\nthe conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly\ndeviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be\nmapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft\nreparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi\nGolden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional\nFermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity\nat high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze\nmagnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle\nconsistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low\ntemperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover\nFermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled\ninterpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively\nlinking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable\ntransport coefficients in strange metals."}

Motivated by recent studies on the optical\ntransparency properties of stealthy hyperuniform layered media, we compute the\nlocalization length via the perturbation theory expansion of the self-energy.\nWe find that, for fixed energy and small but finite disorder strength, there\nexists for any finite length system a range of stealthiness $\\chi$ for which\nthe localization length exceeds the system size. This kind of \"effective\ndelocalization\" is the result of the novel kind of correlated disorder that\nspans a continuous range of length scales, a defining characteristic of\nstealthy systems. Moreover, we support our analytical results with numerical\nsimulations. Our results may serve as a first step in investigating the role of\nstealthy disorder in quantum systems, which is of both theoretical and\nexperimental relevance."}

Under the drive of a weak\nsegmented rotational external field, we observe that the system exhibits cyclic\nsoliton motion; however, in contrast to the predictions of quasi-particle\ntheory, the trajectory of the soliton center shows a distinct drift. The\nunderlying mechanism of this anomalous drift is revealed: the moving soliton\nexperiences a Lorentz force induced by a virtual magnetic monopole field in\nmomentum space. We further calculate the phase evolution of the soliton during\nthis cyclic motion and find that its geometric component comprises both an\nadiabatic Berry phase and a nonadiabatic Aharonov-Anandan phase. Notably, the\nBerry phase can be expressed in terms of the magnetic flux of the\naforementioned virtual monopole field. Our findings hold implications for\ngeometric phase theory and experiments on two-component Bose-Einstein\ncondensates, and may establish a novel link between quantum geometry and\nsoliton dynamics."}

In the classical setting, by considering a simple\nparadigmatic model, our simulations reveal the emergence of Negative\nDifferential Thermal Resistance (NDTR): paradoxically, increasing the\ntemperature bias by lowering the cold bath temperature reduces the steady-state\nheat current. In sharp contrast, the quantum version of the model, treated via\na Lindblad master equation, exhibits no NDTR: the heat current increases\nmonotonically with thermal bias. This marked divergence highlights the\nfundamental role of quantum effects in low-temperature thermal transport and\nunderscores the need to reconsider classical predictions when designing and\noptimizing nanoscale thermal devices."}
