### [1] [Deconfined quantum criticality on a triangular Rydberg array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08366)
*Lisa Bombieri,Torsten V. Zache,Gabriele Calliari,Mikhail D. Lukin,Hannes Pichler,Daniel González-Cuadra*

Main category: quant-ph

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解禁闭量子临界点（DQCPs）的实验证据稀缺，论文旨在通过里德堡原子系统探索这一现象。

Method: 使用场论分析和数值模拟，研究了1/3和2/3里德堡激发密度之间的相变，预测了临界指数和对称性。

Result: 预测了临界指数和U(1)对称性的出现，并通过数值模拟验证了这些预测。

Conclusion: 论文展示了在里德堡原子系统中实现DQCP的可能性，并提出了实验探测方法。

Abstract: Fluctuations can drive continuous phase transitions between two distinct
ordered phases -- so-called Deconfined Quantum Critical points (DQCPs) -- which
lie beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. Despite several theoretical
predictions over the past decades, experimental evidence of DQCPs remains
elusive. We show that a DQCP can be explored in a system of Rydberg atoms
arranged on a triangular lattice and coupled through van der Waals
interactions. Specifically, we investigate the nature of the phase transition
between two ordered phases at 1/3 and at 2/3 Rydberg excitation density, which
were recently probed experimentally in [P. Scholl et al., Nature 595, 233
(2021)]. Using a field-theoretical analysis, we predict both the critical
exponents for infinitely long cylinders of increasing circumference and the
emergence of a conformal field theory near criticality showing an enlarged U(1)
symmetry -- a signature of DQCPs -- and confirm these predictions numerically.
Finally, we extend these results to ladder geometries and show how the emergent
U(1) symmetry could be probed experimentally using finite tweezer arrays.

Conclusion: 数字量子模拟平坦带物理在当前NISQ设备上可行，压缩电路技术为研究平坦带系统在量子技术中的应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: We study the dynamics on the flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (AFB) lattices
using a digital quantum computer. By utilizing an advanced tensor network
method to compress the quantum circuit, we overcome the intrinsic limitations
of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. This enables
high-fidelity simulations of time evolution over extended timescales and
various interesting dynamical behaviours are observed in our digital quantum
simulation. We start from the quantum simulation of the single-particle quantum
walk on the FB and AFB lattices, which are realized by tuning the magnetic flux
per plaquette to $\phi=0$ and $\phi=\pi$ respectively. With compressed quantum
circuit, we are able to simulate the delocalization in FB lattice and the
Aharonov-Bohm caging in AFB lattice. Next, we integrate FB and ABF lattices
within a one-dimensional lattice structure and study how these lattices can be
utilized to control quantum transport. Moreover, we investigate the
effectiveness of a single ABF lattice in controlling the two particles dynamics
without and with interaction. We find that the hopping amplitude remains an
effective and tunable parameter for controlling particle transport even in the
presence of interactions. Our results show that digital quantum simulations of
flat-band physics are feasible on current digital NISQ devices through circuit
compression. Moreover, this capability enables us to study the potential
applications of flat-band systems in quantum control and emerging quantum
technologies.

Result: 证明了量子分数匹配与学习反向过程酉生成器的数学等价性，并为有限关联长度态和一般态提供了严格误差界。

Conclusion: 该框架将Petz恢复映射作为量子反向Fokker-Planck方程的推广，为量子态生成提供了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical
and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The
measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories
while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at
the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems:
trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery
of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score
matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the
reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz
recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow
reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our
framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse
Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery
channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches
to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information
science.

### [5] [Derivation from classical Majorana--Bloch equation to quantum von Neumann equation for any angular momenta in coherent states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08414)
*Lihong V. Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出将Bloch方程更名为Majorana--Bloch方程，并将其推导推广到高自旋或角动量系统，建立了与von Neumann方程的一一对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Majorana的工作早于Bloch 14年的事实，作者认为Bloch方程应更名为Majorana--Bloch方程，并希望将这一推导推广到更高自旋系统。

Method: 使用相干态投影的多项式表示，推导了Majorana--Bloch方程与von Neumann方程之间的可逆映射。

Result: 建立了两种形式之间的一一对应关系，并通过Ehrenfest定理验证了经典运动方程的再现。

Conclusion: 论文成功将Majorana--Bloch方程的推导推广至高自旋系统，并验证了其与量子力学形式的一致性。

Abstract: After publishing the derivation from the classical Bloch equation to the
quantum von Neumann equation to the Schr\"odinger--Pauli equation for spin-1/2,
we proposed renaming the Bloch equation to the Majorana--Bloch equation because
Majorana's work predated Bloch's in the presentation of the Bloch equation by
14 years. Here, we generalize our previous derivation to higher spins or
angular momenta in coherent pure states. Using the polynomial representation of
the coherent-state projector, we derive an invertible mapping from the
Majorana--Bloch equation to the von Neumann equation, establishing a one-to-one
correspondence between these two formalisms. Application of the Ehrenfest
theorem also shows that expectation values in these states reproduce the
classical equation of motion.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is recognized as a fundamental resource in quantum
information processing and is essential for understanding quantum many-body
physics. However, experimentally detecting entanglement, particularly in
many-particle quantum states, remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose
split spectroscopy as an experimentally feasible technique for detecting
entanglement of eigenstates in quantum many-body systems. We demonstrate the
split spectroscopy exhibits a single delta-function peak if and only if the
investigated eigenstate is triseparable. Our framework is illustrated using two
paradigmatic spin models that undergo quantum phase transitions. Furthermore,
we show that the spectral entropy serves as a powerful indicator of quantum
phase transitions and captures the scaling behavior of entanglement. Finally,
we present an experimental protocol using Rydberg atom arrays.

Conclusion: 该方案结合单原子量子比特和冷原子系综的优势，为可扩展的分布式量子计算和传感提供了新途径。

Abstract: Single neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays offer a promising platform for
high-fidelity quantum computing at local nodes. Nonetheless, creating
entanglement between remote nodes in a distributed quantum network remains
challenging due to inherently weak atom-light coupling. Here, we design a
distributed quantum network architecture in which cold atomic ensembles with
strong atom-light interactions act as quantum antennas, interfacing single-atom
qubits with flying photons to enable high-efficiency atom-photon entanglement
generation -- analogous to the role of antennas in classical communication.
Using realistic experimental parameters, we estimate an efficiency of $\eta
\simeq 0.548$ for generating atom-photon entanglement, a probability of $P_{E}
\simeq 6 \%$ for generating atom-atom entanglement, and a remote entanglement
generation rate of $16.6 $ kHz. This performance not only surpasses that of
state-of-the-art cavity-based or high-numerical-aperture-lens-based
architectures but also offers notable advantages in simplicity, tunability, and
experimental accessibility. Our scheme also integrates a long-lived quantum
memory, providing a storage advantage for quantum repeater design. By
leveraging the complementary strengths of single-atom qubits for local
operations and cold atomic ensembles for networking, this approach paves the
way for scalable distributed quantum computing and sensing.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子系统的概率表示提供了通用框架，并展示了在多粒子系统中的应用潜力。

Abstract: We use the free evolution propagator to determine the quantum probability
representation (i.e., the general expression of the tomogram) of any
one-dimensional system described by a density state. The evolution operator for
the considered quantum system is additionally used to establish the
corresponding time dependent tomogram. Applications are given for a Gaussian
wave packet, the quantum shutter related with the phenomenon of diffraction in
time, the double quantum shutter, and a finite potential. A generalisation to
describe $N$ particle systems is also presented and, in particular, we find the
tomogram associated to the 2 particle case occupying in general non-orthogonal
states. In the latter case, for a bipartite quantum system, the entanglement
properties are established by considering quantum information concepts such as
the linear entropy.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of
conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the
minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently,
[Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential
maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global
optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark
these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including
one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and
next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total
$x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling
interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal
states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular
and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems
as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian
constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges
constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned
algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including
those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect
one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.
Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as
alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed
temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these
encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical
qubits.

Main category: quant-ph

Result: 并行方法生成纠缠态的速度比顺序方法快10倍，保真度更高（0.92 vs 0.69）。

Conclusion: 该方法为固态量子平台的可扩展纠缠生成和控制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential aspect of quantum systems, needed
to execute quantum algorithms, implement error correction, and achieve
quantum-enhanced sensing. In solid-state quantum registers such
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, entangled states are typically
created using sequential, pairwise gates between the central electron and
individual nuclear qubits. This sequential approach is slow and suffers from
crosstalk errors. Here, we demonstrate a parallelized multi-qubit entangling
gate to generate a four-qubit GHZ state using a room-temperature NV center in
only 14.8 $\mu$s $-$ 10 times faster than using sequences of two-qubit gates.
The entangled states are verified by measuring multiple quantum coherences.
Two-qubit entangling gates have an average fidelity of 0.96(1), and the
four-qubit parallel gate has a fidelity of 0.92(4), whereas the sequential
four-qubit gate fidelity is only 0.69(3). The approach is generalizable to
other solid-state platforms, and it lays the foundation for scalable generation
and control of entanglement in practical devices.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为开放量子系统的动力学控制提供了有效工具，但需满足特定约束条件。

Abstract: We address the control of the dynamics of both population and coherence phase
in an open two-level quantum system employing a single external control field.
The system dynamics is described by a Markovian master equation that takes into
account dephasing and thermal noise. The control is engineered by inverting the
underlying equations of motion, which yields an analytical expression for the
control field in terms of user-specified time-dependent functions for the
population and coherence phase. Our approach allows to dictate not only the
initial and final populations and phases, but the full dynamics of these
quantities. The chosen functions for population and phase have to conform to
certain constraints indicated in our analysis. Our methodology also reveals the
possible transitions for given initial conditions and environmental noise
parameters.

Abstract: The study of quantum thermodynamics aims to elucidate the role played by
quantum principles in the emergent features of quantum thermodynamic processes.
Specifically, it is of fundamental importance to understand how quantum
correlation among different parties enables thermodynamic features
distinguishable from those arising in classical thermodynamics. In this work,
we investigate the relation between extractable work and quantum correlations
for two-mode Gaussian states. We examine the change in local energy occurring
at one party due to a Gaussian measurement performed on the other in relation
to the quantum correlations of two-mode states classified as separable,
entangled, and steerable states. Our analysis reveals a clear quantitative
difference in the extractable work, depending on the class of states to which
the two-mode state belongs.

Abstract: Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a
tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state
tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science
and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances
in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical
elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity,
miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal
were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial
qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit
tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural
question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is
sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In
this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical
experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over
11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show
that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces
perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in
Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we
discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multi-photon
cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized,
and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.

Abstract: Catering to emerging satellite-based free-space optical (FSO) communication
networks and exploiting polarization encoding via Stokes operators, we propose
a novel simultaneous quantum-classical communications (SQCC) protocol. The
protocol enables the coexistence of secure quantum communications and
high-throughput classical communications with minimal alterations in both the
infrastructure and the energy input. Compared to the conventional SQCC
protocol, our new approach provides superior practicality in the real world,
eliminates the need for a separate local oscillator, and allows for the simple
readout of both quantum and classical information using direct detection. The
protocol also minimizes the undesirable interplay between the quantum and the
classical parts of communication. We provide a detailed mathematical
formulation of the protocol, along with theoretical and numerical analysis of
its performance, illustrating a promising path to practical and effective
realization of combined classical-quantum communications

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the fastest-growing and relatively mature
technology in the field of quantum information, enabling
information-theoretically secure key distribution between two remote users.
Although QKD based on off-the-shelf telecom components has been validated in
both laboratory and field tests, its high cost and large volume remain major
obstacles to large-scale deployment. Photonic integration, featured by its
compact size and low cost, offers an effective approach to addressing the above
challenges faced by QKD. Here, we implement a high-performance, integrated
local local oscillator continuous-variable (CV) QKD system based on an
integrated silicon photonic transmitter and receiver. By employing a high-speed
silicon photonic integrated in-phase and quadrature modulator, a low-noise and
high bandwidth silicon photonic integrated heterodyne detector, and digital
signal processing, our CV-QKD system achieves a symbol rate of up to 1.5625
GBaud. Furthermore, the system achieves asymptotic secret key rates of 31.05

using an 8-phase-shift keying discrete modulation. Our integrated CV-QKD system
with high symbol rate and long transmission distance pays the way for the
quantum secure communication network at metropolitan area.

Result: CD-Kennedy接收器在BER和SKR性能上优于传统零差接收器，且在不同透射率下表现出不同的性能趋势。

Conclusion: CD-Kennedy接收器在湍流信道中具有更强的鲁棒性和性能优势，适用于通信和密钥分发的不同场景。

Abstract: Endogenous security in next-generation wireless communication systems
attracts increasing attentions in recent years. A typical solution to
endogenous security problems is the quantum key distribution (QKD), where
unconditional security can be achieved thanks to the inherent properties of
quantum mechanics. Continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enjoys
high secret key rate (SKR) and good compatibility with existing optical
communication infrastructure. Traditional CV-QKD usually employ coherent
receivers to detect coherent states, whose detection performance is restricted
to the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we employ a generalized Kennedy
receiver called CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the detection performance of
coherent states in turbulent channels, where equal-gain combining (EGC) method
is used to combine the output of CD-Kennedy receivers. Besides, we derive the
SKR of a post-selection based CV-QKD protocol using both CD-Kennedy receiver
and homodyne receiver with EGC in turbulent channels. We further propose an
equivalent transmittance method to facilitate the calculation of both the
bit-error rate (BER) and SKR. Numerical results show that the CD-Kennedy
receiver can outperform the homodyne receiver in turbulent channels in terms of
both BER and SKR performance. We find that BER and SKR performance advantage of
CD-Kennedy receiver over homodyne receiver demonstrate opposite trends as the
average transmittance increases, which indicates that two separate system
settings should be employed for communication and key distribution purposes.
Besides, we also demonstrate that the SKR performance of a CD-Kennedy receiver
is much robust than that of a homodyne receiver in turbulent channels.

Abstract: Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies
which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The
hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to
solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as
combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of
next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a
black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing
(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization
Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled
from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).
According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on
exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced
performance of exploration and exploitation which we call
exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests
to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA
certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms
FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further
improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes
such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the
former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration
performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low
computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the
effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of
significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale
problems with correspondingly low computational cost.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了扩展参数移位规则（EPSR），通过选择最优参数移位来最小化导数方差，提高导数估计的准确性，并适用于更广泛的哈密顿算子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数移位规则（PSRs）仅适用于简单的哈密顿算子，且无法优化参数移位以最小化方差。EPSR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: EPSR通过线性组合不同参数移位的成本函数值，提供无限可能的移位选择，并优化移位以最小化导数方差。

Result: EPSR不仅适用于任意哈密顿算子，还能通过最优移位显著提高导数估计的准确性。

Conclusion: EPSR扩展了PSRs的适用范围，并通过优化移位提供了更准确的导数估计方法。

Abstract: Parameter shift rules (PSRs) are useful methods for computing arbitrary-order
derivatives of the cost function in parameterized quantum circuits. The basic
idea of PSRs is to evaluate the cost function at different parameter shifts,
then use specific coefficients to combine them linearly to obtain the exact
derivatives. In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR)
which generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two
advantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts,
allowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final
derivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative
estimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the
PSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate
$U(x) = \exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs
are valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words.
Additionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by
Wierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it
yields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the
weighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter
shifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates.

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对Dicke-Stark系统中量子现象的理解，为相关领域提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this study, the energy spectrum and thermal equilibrium states of the
finite-size Dicke-Stark model were numerically obtained within the extended
coherent state space by solving the dressed master equation for strongly
coupled light-atom systems. The critical point of the superradiant phase
transition in the infinite-size Dicke-Stark model was analytically derived
using the mean-field approach and confirmed with numerical calculation. Under
thermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay
two-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the
finite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases,
the light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching
and then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and
minimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding
coupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and
spin squeezing. As temperature rises, entanglement gradually diminishes, while
strong coupling facilitates the preservation of entanglement in the system
state. Atom-spin squeezing spin squeezing is highly sensitive to temperature
and vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature. This work contributes to the
fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena in Dicke-Stark systems.

Conclusion: 研究结果为NP完全问题提供了量子加速的实证证据。

Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage remains a key milestone in the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era. Without rigorous complexity proofs, scaling
advantage-where quantum resource requirements grow more slowly than their
classical counterparts-serves as the primary indicator. However, direct
applications of quantum optimization algorithms to classically intractable
problems have yet to demonstrate this advantage. To address this challenge, we
develop enhanced quantum solvers for the NP-complete one-in-three Boolean
satisfiability problem. We propose a restricting space reduction algorithm
(RSRA) that achieves optimal search space dimensionality, thereby reducing both
qubits and time complexity for various quantum solvers. Extensive numerical
investigations on problem instances with up to 65 variables demonstrate that
our enhanced quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum
adiabatic algorithm (QAA)-based solvers outperform state-of-the-art classical
solvers, with the QAA-based solver providing a lower bound for our method while
exhibiting scaling advantage. Furthermore, we experimentally implement our
enhanced solvers on a superconducting quantum processor with 13 qubits,
confirming the predicted performance improvements. Collectively, our results
provide empirical evidence of quantum speedup for an NP-complete problem.

Motivation: 研究BP现象对变分量子算法的优化效率的影响，旨在通过统计方法揭示BP的特征并提出缓解策略。

Method: 使用高斯函数模型识别三种BP类型，并在VQE中验证其存在性。通过遗传算法优化ansatz设计以缓解BP。

Result: 发现VQE中主要存在everywhere-flat BPs，而其他两种BP类型未观察到。遗传算法优化显著改善了优化效率。

Conclusion: BP现象在特定ansatz中占主导地位，遗传算法是缓解BP的有效方法，有助于提升变分量子算法的可扩展性和可靠性。

Abstract: We investigate the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon in variational quantum
algorithms using a statistical approach. Using Gaussian function models, we
identify three distinct types of BPs. The first type, which we called
localized-dip BPs, occurs in landscapes that are mostly flat but contain a dip
point where the gradient is large in a small region around the minimum. The
second type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the
localized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called
everywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with
almost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.
After illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend
the analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We consider two
types of ans\"atze: the hardware-efficient ansatz and the random Pauli ansatz.
For both ans\"atze, we only observe the everywhere-flat BPs. Using our
statistical approach, we searched for localized-dip and localized-gorge BPs but
found no evidence of such features in the examples studied, suggesting that
everywhere-flat BPs dominate in these ans\"atze. Our method effectively probes
landscape features by capturing the gradient scaling across parameter space,
making it a useful tool for diagnosing BPs in variational algorithms. To
mitigate BPs in the VQE, we employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the
random gates generated in the ans\"atze, thereby reshaping the cost function
landscape to enhance the optimization efficiency. A comparison with an
unoptimized ansatz shows how the ansatz design can improve the scalability and
reliability of variational quantum algorithms.

Result: t-NQS方法在波导QED设置中表现优异，与张量网络计算性能相当。

Conclusion: t-NQS方法为研究非平衡态开放量子多体系统提供了新的潜力。

Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides constitute a
paradigmatic quantum-optical platform for exploring collective phenomena in
open quantum many-body systems. For appropriately spaced emitters, they realize
the Dicke model, whose characteristic permutation symmetry allows for efficient
exact solutions featuring superradiance. When the emitters are arbitrarily
spaced, however, this symmetry is lost and general analytical solutions are no
longer available. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical method to study
the dynamics of such systems by extending the time-dependent neural quantum
state (t-NQS) framework to open quantum systems. We benchmark our approach
across a range of waveguide QED settings and compare its performance with
tensor-network calculations. Our results demonstrate that the t-NQS approach is
competitive with other numerical methods and highlight the potential of t-NQSs
for studying open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium.

Motivation: 研究如何在放宽无信息条件下仍保持相互无偏性，探索MEBs的性质及其在量子信息中的应用。

Method: 定义MEBs并推导其约束条件，研究测量不兼容性，构造正映射和纠缠见证。

Result: 对于d=2,3，推导了完整的MEBs集合；构造了基于MEBs的纠缠见证，并展示了在某些情况下MEBs优于MUBs。

Conclusion: MEBs提供了一种灵活的框架，适用于量子信息处理，尤其在纠缠检测中表现出潜在优势。

Abstract: In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one
basis gives \emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another
basis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes
to be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution
$q=(q_0,\cdots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is
preserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any
preparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is
chosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect
to the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of
this, we define the notion of \emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such
that within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of
the other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to
each other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual
equi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading
for $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\le\mu \le 1/2$ where
$\mu=\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements
in MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective
measurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty
inequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated
entanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed
from MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same
number of bases, for certain values of the index $\mu$, employing a larger set
of MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic
states of a $3\times 3$ system.

theory, enabling the retrieval of quantum information lost due to noisy
processes. Here, we experimentally implement the Petz recovery map on a nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor using the duality quantum computing
(DQC) algorithm. Focusing on two paradigmatic single-qubit channels, namely
phase damping and amplitude damping, we demonstrate that the recovered states
closely match theoretical predictions. Our results validate the feasibility of
the Petz-based recovery map in current quantum platforms and highlight its
relevance for near-term error mitigation strategies.

Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing
performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for
extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the
truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether
the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact,
the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary
evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the
infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the
generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite
excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we
present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to
even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different
self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To
make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize
it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental
implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the
Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the
parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed
renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.

Conclusion: 为阿秒量子干涉实验的研究开辟了新路径。

Abstract: The advantage of attosecond measurements is the possibility of time-resolving
ultrafast quantum phenomena of electron dynamics. Many such measurements are of
interferometric nature, and therefore give access to the phase. Likewise, weak
measurements are intrinsically interferometric and specifically take advantage
of interfering probability amplitudes, therefore encoding the phase information
of the process. In this work, we show that attosecond interferometry
experiments can be seen as a weak measurement, which unveils how this notion is
connected to strong field physics and attosecond science. In particular, we
show how the electron trajectory picks up a new phase, which occurs due to the
weak measurement of the process. This phase can show significant contributions
in the presence of spectral features of the measured system. Furthermore,
extending this approach to include non-classical driving fields shows that the
generated harmonics exhibit non-trivial features in their quantum state and
photon statistics. This opens the path towards investigations of attosecond
quantum interferometry experiments.

Abstract: This work extends quantum optical models of high harmonic generation by
considering a quantum stochastic analysis of the field modes coupled to an
environment. In particular, we study the open system dynamics by solving the
quantum Langevin equation for a non-linear driven cavity coupled to the
environment. For an unstructured environment without memory, we show that the
emission characteristics of the intense driven cavity is isomorphic to the
process of high harmonic generation and a non-linear antenna. This is achieved
by using the quantum regression theorem for the Markovian dynamics, and further
allows to obtain the upper bound of the radiated power due to the emitter
fluctuations. This opens the path to connect current quantum optical approaches
of HHG with open system descriptions and towards driven-dissipative systems in
the non-linear regime.

Abstract: Implementing quantum game theory on real hardware is challenging due to
noise, decoherence, and limited qubit connectivity, yet such demonstrations are
essential to validate theoretical predictions. We present one of the first full
experimental realizations of the Battle of the Sexes game under the
Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) framework on IBM Quantum's ibm sherbrooke
superconducting processor. Four quantum strategies (I, H, $R(\pi/4)$, $R(\pi)$)
were evaluated across 31 entanglement values $\gamma \in [0, \pi]$ using 2048
shots per configuration, enabling a direct comparison between analytical
predictions and hardware execution. To mitigate noise and variability, we
introduce a Guided Circuit Mapping (GCM) method that dynamically selects qubit
pairs and optimizes routing based on real-time topology and calibration data.
The analytical model forecasts up to $108\%$ payoff improvement over the
classical equilibrium, and despite hardware-induced deviations, experimental
results with GCM preserve the expected payoff trends within $3.5\%$-$12\%$
relative error. These findings show that quantum advantages in strategic
coordination can persist under realistic NISQ conditions, providing a pathway
toward practical applications of quantum game theory in multi-agent, economic,
and distributed decision-making systems.

spatial-temporal encoded, 8176-mode, programmable photonic quantum processor,
Jiuzhang 4.0, which produces up to 3050 photon de- tection events. Our
experimental results outperform all classical spoofing algorithms, particularly
the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise
photon loss to reduce the classical simula- tion complexity of the GBS. Using
the state-of-the-art MPS algorithm on the most powerful supercomputer EI
Capitan, it would take > 1042 years to construct the required tensor network
for simulation, while our Jiuzhang 4.0 quantum computer takes 25.6 {\mu}s to
produce a sample. This work establishes a new frontier of QCA and paves the way
to fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing hardware.

Abstract: In this work, we simulate the behavior of photons in a laboratory experiment
using a quantum computer and examine how the simulation results compare with
the theoretical predictions. The experiment involves both protective and
non-protective measurements. While the latter involves complete wavefunction
collapse, the former combines weak interactions with a protective mechanism
thereby preserving the photon wave function coherence until its final
detection. The simulation gives insights as to how efficient quantum computers
can be in simulating actual physical systems as the amount of computation
increases.

Abstract: Random party distillation refers to the process by which
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs are randomly extracted from a single copy of a
multipartite entangled state after multiple rounds of performing positive
operator value measure operations. In this work, we propose a qubit-based
implementation of a random party distillation protocol and demonstrate its

4-round implementation of the protocol, showing distillation rates superior
(0.81 pairs/ W state) to the state of the art. Finally, we explore the
dynamical properties of the protocol when implemented on superconducting
hardware, and how errors introduced by mid-circuit measurements can be
mitigated.

Abstract: Optically addressed atomic defects in the solid-state are widely used as
single-photon sources and memories for quantum network applications. The
solid-state environment allows for a high density of electron and nuclear spins
with the potential to form registers for coherent information processing.
However, it is challenging to reliably address individual spins at nanometer
separations where interactions are large. Rare-earth ions offer a unique
solution, as their narrow homogeneous optical linewidth allows frequency-domain
resolution of a large number of emitters without regard to their spatial
separation. In this work, we realize coherent optical and spin control of a
pair of interacting Er$^{3+}$ ions, together with a nearby nuclear spin
ancilla. We demonstrate two-qubit electron-electron gates and use them to
perform repeated quantum non-demolition measurements on one of the Er$^{3+}$
ions. We also demonstrate electron-nuclear gates to allow coherent storage and
retrieval of qubit information in a nuclear spin, and show that the nuclear
spin coherence survives readout of the electron spin. These techniques can be
readily scaled to larger numbers of electron and nuclear spins, paving the way
for massively multiplexed quantum network nodes.

Result: 建立了基于仪器的资源理论的层次结构，并提供了量化这些资源的措施。

Conclusion: 本文为基于仪器的量子资源理论提供了详细的框架，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: Quantum resources are certain features of the quantum world that provide
advantages in certain information-theoretic, thermodynamic, or any other useful
operational tasks that are outside the realm of what classical theories can
achieve. Quantum resource theories provide us with an elegant framework for
studying these resources quantitatively and rigorously. While numerous
state-based quantum resource theories have already been investigated, and to
some extent, measurement-based resource theories have also been explored,
instrument-based resource theories remain largely unexplored, with only a few
notable exceptions. As quantum instruments are devices that provide both the
classical outcomes of induced measurements and the post-measurement quantum
states, they are quite important, especially for scenarios where multiple
parties sequentially act on a quantum system. In this work, we study several
instrument-based resource theories, namely (1) the resource theory of
information preservability, (2) the resource theory of (strong) entanglement
preservability, (3) the resource theory of (strong) incompatibility
preservability, (4) the resource theory of traditional incompatibility, and (5)
the resource theory of parallel incompatibility. Furthermore, we outline the
hierarchies of these instrument-based resources and provide measures to
quantify them. In short, we provide a detailed framework for several
instrument-based quantum resource theories.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建遍历性检测的计算工具提供了指导，并解决了相关误解。

Abstract: The mathematical definitions of distinct concepts that are needed in building
an ergodicity detec- tion algorithm are introduced in a framework. This
algorithmic framework is expressed in a discrete setting in an accessible
manner for broader quantitative practitioners without loss of generality. At
the same time, the common misconceptions of the requirement of visiting all
available states in the time-averaged quantities for physical systems and
non-existence of an ergodic process are resolved by introducing the distinction
between Gibbs-Boltzmann and von Neumann-Birkhoff ergodic regimes. For this
purpose, we introduce a new concept which is called sufficiency of sparse
visit. We use finite symbolic random sequences as a pedagogical tool in
establishing the different approaches for the detection of ergodic regimes of
dynamical systems with vector patterns. The simple example system conveys the
different attitudes in ergodicity regimes and offers guidance for building
computational tools for its algorithmic detection.

Method: 在开放量子系统框架下推导动力学方程，并通过耗散自旋-玻色模型验证，与HEOM数值方法对比。

Result: 发现双时间关联函数的弛豫行为依赖于算符类型，QRT在最快弛豫时间尺度后成立，与HEOM结果一致。

Conclusion: 超强耦合下双时间关联函数的行为与弱耦合不同，QRT在特定条件下成立，为相关研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, we derive the dynamical equation
governing two-time correlation functions in the ultra-strong coupling (USC)
regime between the system and its environment. Unlike the case of the standard
weak-coupling regime, in the USC case, we find distinct relaxation behavior for
two-time correlators depending on the types of the operators involved in the
correlation function. Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT)
emerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the
system-bath coupling strength. We exemplify our findings for the dissipative
spin-boson model and further find excellent agreement with the numerically
exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method.

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在最小被动系统中，各向异性热波动也能诱导出稳定的非平衡态和相干运动。

Abstract: We develop a minimal theoretical model that reveals a structured steady-state
flux field with four alternating local circulation, a phenomenon we refer to as
quadrupolar gyration. A passive Brownian particle is confined to move in a
ring-shaped trap and driven far from equilibrium solely by anisotropic thermal
fluctuations from two orthogonal heat baths held at different temperatures. By
breaking detailed balance, this fundamental temperature anisotropy induces a
robust nonequilibrium steady state characterized by probability currents of the
particle's motion. Remarkably, these currents self-organize into a distinctive
quadrupolar vortex pattern, providing a clear signature of emergent symmetry
breaking, irreversible entropy production, and coherent motion in minimal
passive systems.

Abstract: Systems undergoing phase-ordering kinetics after a quench into the ordered
phase with $0<T<T_c$ from a fully disordered initial state and with a
non-conserved order-parameter have the dynamical exponent ${z}=2$. The
long-time behaviour of their single-time and two-time correlators, determined
by the noisy initial conditions, is derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance and
we show that the generic ageing scaling forms of the correlators follow from
the Schr\"odinger covariance of the four-point response functions. The
autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ is related to the passage exponent $\zeta_p$
which describes the time-scale for the cross-over into the ageing regime. Both
Porod's law and the bounds $d/2 \leq \lambda \leq d$ are reproduced in a simple
way. The dynamical scaling in fully finite systems and of global correlators is
found and the low-temperature generalisation $\lambda= d-2\Theta$ of the
Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann scaling relation is derived.

Abstract: We investigate how microscopic features of interparticle potentials influence
macroscopic critical point parameters. Our analytical calculations are based on
the cell model for continuous many-particle systems. We explore two types of
pair interactions described by the Morse potential and a Curie-Weiss-type
potential. For Morse fluids, we present numerical results obtained with
microscopic parameters corresponding to the alkali metals sodium (Na) and
potassium (K). The calculated dimensionless critical point parameters for
liquid Na and K, expressed in dimensional units, allow for direct comparison
with available experimental and simulation data. For the Curie-Weiss cell model
with competing interactions, which exhibits a sequence of first-order phase
transitions, we examine the critical parameters for the first three critical
points. We analyze our results by varying the attractive part of the Morse
potential and the Curie-Weiss attraction strength, providing insights into how
these microscopic characteristics change critical point coordinates.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and
study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings
(SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete
guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described
by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange
interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary
situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In
the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2
chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and
providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that
effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM
interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM
interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be
realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we
employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a
multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven
by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs
(chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in
the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in
the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit
device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum
dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing
quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.

Conclusion: 为超越任意子凝聚的拓扑相变理论框架开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly
understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and
double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them
can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a
directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem.
Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct
anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We
confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC
and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly,
using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the
Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from
the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition
between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path
toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions
beyond anyon condensation.

Conclusion: 该相变在低空穴密度下仍保持稳定，为实验平台提供了研究机会。

Abstract: We investigate the Nagaoka-Thouless (NT) ferromagnetic instability in the
strongly interacting $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model by continuously breaking
particle-hole symmetry on a tunable square-triangular lattice geometry. We use
an analytic approach to show that the fully spin-polarized state becomes
unstable to a metastable spin-polaron when the kinetic frustration $t'/t$
exceeds a critical, dimension-dependent value. Large-scale density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from
the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously
into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit.
Remarkably, this transition remains robust at low but finite hole density,
making it accessible in cold-atom and moir\'e Hubbard platforms under strong
interactions. A variational analysis further captures the instability mechanism
at finite density via frustration-induced magnon band deformation.

Abstract: We design a lattice model of non-compact U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions
with a flavor chemical potential and solve it with large-scale determinant
quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For zero flavor chemical potential, the model
realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) which has been
argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac
spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical
potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we
find a ''chiral flux'' phase which is characterized by the generation of a
finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic
Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)$_m$ magnetic
symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which,
due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure
factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure
factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions.
Further, sufficiently strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise
to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting
with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase
where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue
that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin
liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Correlated kagome metals host unique electronic states that enable exotic
quantum phenomena. In the recently emerged CsCr6Sb6, these manifest through
Kondo behavior from localized Cr-3d electrons and unprecedented band flattening
near the Fermi level. Yet the intricate interplay among Kondo screening,
magnetic frustration, and electronic correlations remains poorly understood-a
fundamental gap we address through multifaceted experimental and theoretical
approaches. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal
electronic correlation-renormalized flat bands and muon spin relaxation study
detect short-range magnetic order at TN ~ 80 K. Complementing these findings,
density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations identify
a coherent-incoherent crossover at TN, with a remarkable restoration of
coherence accompanying local moment suppression-an anomalous hallmark of Kondo
behavior. Intriguingly, despite strong interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling,
the system evades long-range magnetic order due to competing magnetic
configurations separated by sub-meV energy differences. These insights
establish CsCr6Sb6 as a prototypical platform for investigating dynamical Kondo
screening in correlated flat-band systems, opening new avenues to study flat
band physics and frustrated magnetism in correlated kagome lattices.

initio many-body perturbation GW theory combined with dynamical mean-field
theory and revealed that the correlation effects of 4$d$ or 4$f$ electrons can
lead to the formation of hole carriers. In YPtBi, the weakly correlated Y-4$d$
electrons constitute the topological bands, and the quadratic-band-touching
point is at the Fermi level at high temperatures. At low temperatures, enhanced
correlations of Y-4$d$ renormalize the topological bands, leading to the
formation of hole pocket. In GdPtBi, the strongly correlated Gd-4$f$ electrons
form the Hubbard-like bands originate from self-energy effects associated with
a topological singularity. These local bands encompass itinerant 4$f$ bands,
which hybridize with topological bands to induce pronounced hole bands. This
concerted effect reduces the hole doping, bringing the chemical potential
closer to the quadratic-band-touching points as the temperature is lowered. The
temperature-induced Lifshitz transition should be responsible for the large
hole bands observed in both topological semimetals in angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy measurements at low temperatures. Our findings
indicate that the integration of correlated fermions within a topological
framework can modulate the energy landscape of topological bands.

TL;DR: 通过水分子插层成功调控Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$的磁性性质，发现其具有反铁磁性和弱铁磁性，展示了中性分子插层在量子磁体工程中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过中性分子（如水）插层调控层状过渡金属氧化物的磁性性质，为量子磁体的设计和发现提供新途径。

Method: 使用傅里叶变换红外光谱、热重分析、差示扫描量热法和Rietveld精修等技术表征水分子插层后的晶体结构，并通过磁化测量和热容分析研究其磁性行为。

Result: 水分子插层显著改变了晶体结构，导致反铁磁转变（$T_N \sim 17.2$ K）和弱铁磁性。磁场诱导自旋翻转，且长程有序在高达9 T的磁场下仍存在。热容分析证实了预期的磁熵。

Conclusion: 水分子插层是一种有效的策略，可用于调控蜂窝状晶格材料的磁性性质，为量子磁体的工程化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We herein report the successful intercalation of water molecules into the
layered honeycomb lattice of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, a Kitaev-candidate compound,
to obtain the hydrated phase Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$$\cdot$$y$H$_2$O ($y \sim$
2.4). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
differential scanning calorimetry, and Rietveld refinements indicate that
crystalline water resides between the cobalt-based honeycomb layers. This
insertion of neutral molecules significantly alters the crystal structure,
increasing the interlayer spacing and modifying the local bonding environment.
Magnetization measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_N \sim
17.2$ K, accompanied by a discernible weak ferromagnetic component. The
application of moderate magnetic fields induces a spin-flop reorientation at
$\mu_0H \sim 5.7$ T. The $\lambda$-type anomaly and long-range order persist up
to 9 T, showing the reconfiguration of the ground state as opposed to its
suppression. Heat-capacity analysis reveals the full $2R\ln2$ magnetic entropy
expected for two $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ moments per formula unit, confirming the
pseudospin description. These findings demonstrate that water intercalation is
a robust strategy for tuning the magnetic properties of honeycomb lattice
materials. Overall, this study highlights neutral-molecule insertion as a
promising route toward the discovery and engineering of quantum magnets based
on layered transition metal oxides.

Motivation: 探索螺旋自旋液体（SSL）在磁制冷中的应用潜力，填补了SSL尚未用于磁制冷的空白。

Method: 通过实验研究GdZnPO单晶在低温（<2K）和磁场（<12T）下的磁热效应和冷却性能。

Result: GdZnPO在临界磁场附近表现出巨大的磁热效应，且冷却性能在4.5K以下仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: GdZnPO是一种高效的磁制冷材料，适用于极低温（~36mK）的制冷应用。

Abstract: Unlike conventional magnetic states, which lack degeneracy, the spiral spin
liquid (SSL) fluctuates among degenerate spiral configurations, with
ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal
space. At low temperatures, the field-induced crossover from the polarized
ferromagnetic state to the SSL results in a large entropy increase and
decalescence, indicating its potential for magnetic cooling. However, magnetic
cooling using a SSL has yet to be reported. Here, we investigate the
magnetocaloric effect and cooling performance of single-crystal GdZnPO, a
spin-7/2 honeycomb-lattice SSL candidate, under a magnetic field $H$ $<$
$H_\mathrm{c}$ ($\mu_0H_\mathrm{c}$ $\sim$ 12 T) applied perpendicular to the
honeycomb plane and below the crossover temperature ($\sim$2 K). For $H$ $\geq$
$H_\mathrm{c}$, GdZnPO enters a polarized non-degenerate ferromagnetic state.
Our results demonstrate that GdZnPO exhibits a giant low-temperature
magnetocaloric effect near $H_\mathrm{c}$, surpassing other magnetocaloric
materials. This giant magnetocaloric effect is well-explained by the frustrated
honeycomb spin model of GdZnPO, suggesting the stability of the SSL below
$H_\mathrm{c}$ down to very low temperatures. Additionally, its magnetic
cooling performance remains robust up to at least 4.5 K, making GdZnPO a
promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration down to $\sim$36 mK through
cycling the applied magnetic field within a narrow range.

Conclusion: BaMn₂Bi₂为研究准粒子在热导率中的贡献提供了独特视角，特别是磁振子的作用及其与其他准粒子的相互作用。

Abstract: Thermal transport, generally mediated by the direct microscopic exchange of
kinetic energy via lattice phonons, can also be modified by contributions from
additional quasiparticles, such as electrons and magnons. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the magnon influence has yet to be realized and
remains an active research area. The most significant roadblock has been a lack
of available materials in which these three quasiparticles can be clearly
identified and quantitatively examined in order to provide an intrinsic
understanding, not only of their independent contributions to thermal
conductivity but also of the cross-correlated interactions among them.
Itinerant antiferromagnetic (AFM) BaMn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ with PT symmetry exhibits
Anderson metal-insulator localization, which can be tuned into the metallic
regime via an applied magnetic field due to its unique electron-magnon
interactions. We identify itinerant AFM BaMn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ as an ideal material
for scientific investigations into how these quasiparticles participate in
thermal conductivity. Here, we present the direct contribution of electrons,
phonons, and magnons to thermal conductivity, as well as their interspecies
interactions, supported by detailed analyses conducted in the framework of the
Boltzmann transport formalism. The comparison of the magneto-thermal
conductivity and magneto-electrical conductivity, as well as the
magneto-Seebeck effect of itinerant antiferromagnetic BaMn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$, gives
unique insight into how magnons participate in longitudinal thermal-associated
phenomena.

Conclusion: TD为理解非厄米拓扑物理提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose and present a concept of Topological Distance (TD), obtained from
the integration of trace distance over the generalized Brillouin zone, in order
to characterize the topological transitions of non-Hermitian systems.
Specifically, such a quantity is used to measure the overall dissimilarity
between eigen wavefunctions upon traversing all possible matter states, and
confirms the phase boundaries through observing the divergences of both TD and
its partial derivatives; we clarify its origin and also offer a theoretical
explanation. The method is developed to characterize the non-Hermitian topology
in a novel way, and shows its generality and effectiveness in 1D non-Hermitian
Kitaev systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians under periodic or open boundary
conditions, and even generalizable to higher-order topological systems,
providing a novel perspective to understand topological physics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Threading magnetic flux into topological phases can induce bound states that
reveal intrinsic properties of the ground state. In a 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological insulator, a quantized $\pi$ flux traps a pair of 1D helical modes,
whereas a trivial insulator hosts none. In this work, we show that in the
presence of even-fold rotation symmetry $C_n$, a 3D band insulator features a
refined $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of the flux response.
Specifically, it can host two distinct types of helical flux-bound modes that
are distinguished by their angular momentum. When both types of flux modes
coexist, the system is not a strong topological insulator, but a
$C_n$-protected topological crystalline insulator. Building on this result, we
propose that flux-threaded nanowires of such topological phase provide a
natural platform for realizing 1D crystalline topological superconductors with
multiple $C_n$-protected Majorana modes.

Abstract: Recent experiments on the chiral kagome antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Ge have
provided strong evidence of proximity-induced spin-polarized superconductivity.
We introduce and explore a minimal model which exhibits a rich phase diagram as
a function of chemical potential and spin canting. We find a valley-singlet
superconducting phase for chemical potentials and canting consistent with the
experimental system. This phase transitions into a Chern insulator at larger
canting and gives way to topological superconducting phases with Chern numbers
${\cal C}_{\rm BdG} = \pm 1, \pm 3$ at other chemical potentials. Our results
show that proximity-induced superconductivity in kagome antiferromagnets is a
promising route towards exotic superconductivity with spin-polarized Cooper
pairs, with potential applications in spintronics.

Abstract: Shuttling spin qubits in systems with large spin-orbit interaction (SOI) can
cause errors during motion. However, in this work, we demonstrate that SOI can
be harnessed to implement an arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit (2Q) gate. We
consider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are
smoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary
high-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and
waiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially,
performing 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization
of a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented
using static dots. Our findings establish a practical route toward direct
implementation of any 2Q gate via spin shuttling, significantly reducing
control overhead in scalable quantum computing architectures.

Conclusion: Cayley-crystals可通过实数跳跃振幅实现，适用于高维动力学，具有在超材料和cQED等平台中的实验潜力。

Abstract: The Cayley-crystals introduced in [F. R. Lux and E. Prodan, Annales Henri
Poincar\'e 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of synthetic lattices whose
Hamiltonians are symmetric under the simply transitive action of a generic
discrete group G. We show that these systems naturally realize the
generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary
discrete gauge groups. The one-body dynamics mimics that of a particle carrying
multiple charges, each experiencing a distinct static gauge-field
configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the
irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup C of G, while the
Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the
embedding of C in G. We analyze in depth the role of other subgroups in shaping
both the lattice geometry and the dynamics. For engineering relevance, we
discuss a theorem that constructs all Cayley-crystals for a given abelian gauge
group, and we provide two-dimensional examples corresponding to crystals
threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Moreover, Cayley-crystals can be
realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can
fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual
exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms.

CSL in bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, a chiral insulator known for its magnetoelectric
properties. Using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments, we
demonstrate the formation of CSLs in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at low temperatures, driven
by the competition between cubic anisotropy and magnetic field. Our
observations of higher harmonics in the SANS signal clearly indicate the
anharmonic nature of the spiral. This finding underscores the complex interplay
between magnetic interactions in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, offering insights for

Abstract: Imprinting magnetism into graphene makes an important step to its
applications in spintronics. An actively explored approach is proximity
coupling of graphene to a 2D magnet. In these endeavors, the use of epitaxial
graphene may bring significant advantages due to its superiority over the
exfoliated counterpart and natural integration with the substrate but the
problem of attaining magnetism persists. Here, we report synthesis and analysis
of a heterostructure coupling epitaxial graphene with a regular lattice of
magnetic atoms formed by Eu intercalation. The magnetization measurements
reveal easy-plane 2D magnetism in the material, with the transition temperature
controlled by low magnetic fields. The emerging negative magnetoresistance and
anomalous Hall effect point at spin polarization of the carriers in graphene.
In the paramagnetic phase, the magnetoresistance in graphene exhibits critical
exponential behavior of the induced magnetic state. The intercalation does not
compromise the parental electronic structure - quantum oscillations in the
resistivity manifest low-mass carriers in graphene. The results are set against
those for an isostructural material based on intercalated nonmagnetic Sr.
Overall, the study expands the family of 2D magnets and establishes a
prospective material for graphene-based spintronics.

Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the electronic band structure and
optical properties of a two-dimensional anisotropic semimetal that is described
by a tilted semi-Dirac type spectrum with a pair of Weyl nodes. We observe that
a tilt along the quadratic direction can give rise to an energy imbalance
between these nodes, contrary to the effect of tilt along the linear direction.
We investigate the optical response of such system subjected to an external AC
bias, aiming to probe the energy imbalance between the nodes. We show that the
anisotropic interband optical conductivity gives a clear signature of
imbalanced nodes by exciting electrons at two different chemical potentials at
near zero frequency indicating, and the difference between these two chemical
potentials is the direct measure of the energy imbalance. Subsequently, we also
investigate the intraband DC conductivity by using the semi-classical Boltzmann
transport theory which reveals that contrary to the tilted Dirac materials,
tilt can convert semi-Dirac material from semimetallic phase to metallic phase.
Furthermore, we periodically drive the system by external time-periodic
perturbation to open up topological gap at those nodes. We also show that the
presence of imbalanced Weyl nodes would prevent the SD material from switching
to Chern topological phase even after opening topological gaps at the nodes as
the bulk remains gapless. Such state cannot be probed by the usual anomalous
Hall response as it will be overshadowed by the bulk contribution. Here, we
show that those gaps at different chemical potential can be probed by optical
excitation.

Abstract: We report quantum oscillations in magnetoresistance that are periodic in
magnetic field ($B$), observed at the interface between
(La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. Unlike
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ > 7$ T and
diminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations
emerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K. Their amplitude decays
exponentially with both temperature and field, specifying dephasing of quantum
interference. Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating
results in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the
oscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We
attribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely
arising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected
quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls. The
relatively long phase coherence length ($\sim$ 1.8 $\mu$m at 0.1 K), estimated
from the oscillation amplitude, highlights the potential of complex oxide
interfaces as a promising platform for exploring quantum interference effects
and advancing device concepts in quantum technologies, such as mesoscopic

detection methods, describes their training with simulated data from the
SimCATS framework, and performs a quantitative comparison with a future
hardware implementation in mind. Furthermore, we investigated the quality of
the optimized approaches on experimentally measured data from a GaAs and a SiGe

Abstract: We present Coulomb-drag measurements on a heterostructure comprising two
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) sheets separated by a 2.5 nm hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) spacer in the quantum Hall (QH) regime. Using top and
bottom gate control, together with an interlayer bias, we independently tune
the two BLG layers into either the lowest (N = 0) or second (N = 1) Landau
level (LL) orbital and probe their interlayer QH states. When both layers
occupy the N = 0 orbital, we observe both interlayer exciton condensates (ECs)
at integer total filling and interlayer fractional QH states, echoing the
results in double monolayer graphene. In contrast to previous studies, however,
when both BLG layers occupy the N = 1 orbital, we also observe quantized drag
signals, signifying an interlayer exciton condensate formed between the second
LLs. By tuning the layer degree of freedom, we find that this N = 1 EC state
arises only when the N = 1 wavefunction in each BLG is polarized toward the hBN
interface to maximize the interlayer Coulomb interaction.
