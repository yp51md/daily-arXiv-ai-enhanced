Remarkably, signatures of\nquantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic\nfields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a\nregime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a\nglobally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by\nan infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation\ndynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal\nstrongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant\ntransition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct\nevidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are\nable to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical\npoint, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced\nquantum dynamics.

The transition point\nseparates regimes with a rich interplay between superconducting and\ndensity-wave orders. In the regime with weaker intralayer hopping,\nquasi-long-range spin-density-wave and pair-density-wave orders coexist, with\nthe former being dominant.

While the determination of the ``free''\nelements is usually guided by the constraints of some experimental setup, this\ncan make it difficult to study similarities and differences between QRTs. In\nthis work, we argue that QRTs follow from the choice of a preferred algebraic\nstructure $\\mathcal{E}$ to be preserved, thus setting the free operations as\nthe automorphisms of $\\mathcal{E}$. We illustrate our finding by determining\n$\\mathcal{E}$ for the QRTs of entanglement, Clifford stabilizerness, purity,\nimaginarity, fermionic Gaussianity, reference frames, thermodynamics and\ncoherence; showing instances where $\\mathcal{E}$ is a Lie algebra, group, ring,\nor even a simple set. This unified understanding allows us to generalize the\nconcept of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) to\nidentify novel resource non-increasing operations for Lie-algebra based QRTs,\nthus finding a new solution to an open problem in the literature.

Building on this foundation,\nwe propose Clique_L2 that extends the Clique-based approach by relaxing some\noriginal constraints and incorporating additional low-cost logic to also\ncorrect length-2 error chains in space, which become non-trivial occurrences at\nhigher physical error rates and code distances. This enhanced capability not\nonly further reduces out-of-the-fridge data transmission but also adapts more\neffectively to clustered errors observed under a variety of noise models.\nSpecifically, under data-qubit-only errors and uniformly random noise,\nClique_L2 achieves up to 8.95x decoding bandwidth reduction over the original\nClique (or Clique_L1) decoder, especially beneficial at higher code distances.\nWhen clustered errors and longer error chains are more likely to occur,\nClique_L2 achieves up to 18.3x decoding bandwidth reduction over Clique_L1,\nachieving substantial benefits across a wide range of physical qubit error\nrates."}

While extensive experiments have explored their coherence\nproperties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its\ncontrol-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin\ndynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$\nrelaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$\ncenter constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which\nnecessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects\nof the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework,\nthis work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B =\n90\\,\\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic\nfield in the $0 \\le B \\le 2000\\,\\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation\nis predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop\nprocesses mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions.

We first analyze the general analytical properties\nof these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution operator of\nnon-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then perform a\nnumerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding to both the\ntime-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing on two\nmany-body systems: the fermionic $t\\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity model,\nusing tensor network simulations.

This indicates that only a small number of orbitals contribute\nsignificantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact\nmatrix-product-operator representation in the natural orbital basis. Finally,\nwe examine the spatial spread of the natural orbitals for time-evolved local\noperators in the impurity model and show that the complexity of this operator\nin the natural orbital basis saturates over time.

In this\nwork, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that\nnaturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion\nPfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and\nsuperconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic\ncomplexity.

At realistic experimental temperatures and confinement\nconditions, atoms are spatially localized into small chains of $\\approx 1-5$\natoms.
