Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CV-QKD因其与现代电信基础设施的无缝兼容性成为更实用的量子密钥分发方案，但其实际部署仍面临理论和技术的挑战。

Method: 通过光子集成电路实现CV-QKD系统的可扩展和高效部署，并利用机器学习和张量网络优化性能和安全。

Conclusion: 结合量子光子集成技术的进步，CV-QKD有望实现大规模、高速量子安全网络的实际应用。

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a cornerstone of secure
communication in the quantum era. While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD)
protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange,
continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative
due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications
infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light,
offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks.
This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings,
technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special
attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in
enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore,
recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD
performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter
optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide
efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations,
improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols.
These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic
integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale,
high-speed quantum-secure networks.

### [2] [Consistent Simulation of Fibonacci Anyon Braiding within a Qubit Quasicrystal Inflation Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21643)
*Marcelo M. Amaral*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于一维准晶膨胀码（QIC）的框架，用于模拟非阿贝尔任意子编织，并通过局部3量子比特结构实现可扩展的量子计算。


<details>

Result: 通过实验验证了框架的有效性，并在IBM量子处理器上成功执行了编织算法，电路深度显著降低。

Conclusion: 该工作为可编程量子系统上任意子编织的模拟提供了可扩展且物理可行的途径。

Abstract: The simulation of non-Abelian anyon braiding is a critical step towards
fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce a framework for this task
based on a one-dimensional Quasicrystal Inflation Code (QIC). The code is
defined by a local Hamiltonian whose ground state manifold enforces Fibonacci
tiling constraints and possesses the correct Fibonacci degeneracy. We derive
the corresponding braid operators and demonstrate that, while they are formally
non-local, they possess an exact, local 3-qubit structure. This allows us to
distill their action into a single, physically realizable $8 \times 8$ gate,
which we term the $B_{gate}$. We prove through comparative compilation for
systems with different numbers of qubits that constructing circuits by
composing these local gates is dramatically more scalable than compiling the
equivalent global unitary, showing a greater than tenfold reduction in circuit
depth. To validate the framework, we successfully executed a braiding algorithm
for the Jones polynomial, a topological invariant of knots, on an IBM Quantum
processor, quantifying the signal degradation due to hardware noise. Finally,
we numerically confirm for systems up to 17 qubits that our construction
rigorously satisfies the required Temperley-Lieb and braid group relations
while preserving the code subspace. This work establishes a validated and
physically grounded pathway for the scalable simulation of anyonic braiding on
programmable quantum systems.

Result: 发现纠缠衰减遵循指数规律，并确定了量子相干与经典态的阈值。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了退相干理论，为量子传感和成像等技术的设计提供了定量标准。

Abstract: The resilience of quantum entanglement under irreversible,
energy-transferring interactions remains a fundamental question in quantum
foundations and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a fully microscopic
quantum electrodynamics framework to describe how spatial entanglement evolves
when one particle of an entangled pair undergoes dissipative processes such as
ionization or inelastic scattering. We show that entanglement decay follows an
exponential law governed by recoil-induced momentum diffusion and identify a
sharp operational threshold separating quantum-coherent and classical regimes.
This threshold depends on whether the cumulative recoil-induced uncertainty
exceeds the intrinsic bandwidth of the entangled state. Our results extend
decoherence theory beyond Gaussian and weak-coupling models, providing
quantitative criteria for entanglement survival in radiative environments and
informing the design of robust quantum protocols in quantum sensing, imaging,
and radiation-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for computing time-dependent quantum transition
rates (QTRs) that describe the pace of evolution of a quantum state from a
given subspace to a target subspace. QTRs are expressed in terms of flux-flux
correlators and are shown to obey two complementary quantum speed limits. Our
framework readily accommodates the generalization of Hamiltonian dynamics to
arbitrary open quantum evolution, including quantum measurements. We illustrate
how QTRs can be controlled by counterdiabatic driving.

### [5] [Characterizing non-Markovianity via quantum coherence based on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21691)
*Yassine Dakir,Abdallah Slaoui,Rachid Ahl Laamara*

Main category: quant-ph

Conclusion: 基于Kirkwood-Dirac准概率相干性的方法为非马尔可夫动力学分析提供了新的视角，且具有实验可操作性和物理直观性。

Abstract: We present a new measure of non-Markovianity based on the property of
nonincreasing quantum coherence via Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability under
incoherent completely positive trace-preserving maps. Quantum coherence via the
KD quasiprobability is defined as the imaginary part of the KD
quasiprobability, which is maximised over all possible second bases and
evaluated using an incoherent reference basis. A measure non-Markovianity based
on KD quasiprobability coherence would capture memory effects via the time
evolution of the imaginary part of the KD quasiprobability, providing an
experimentally accessible and physically intuitive alternative to traditional
measures relying on quantum Fisher information or trace distance. This approach
is applied to the study of dissipation and dephasing dynamics in single- and
two-qubit systems. The results obtained show that, in the cases studied, our
measure based on coherence via Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability performs at
least as well as $\ell_{1}$-norm coherence in detecting non-Markovianity, this
provides a novel perspective on the analysis of non-Markovian dynamics.

### [6] [Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by many-body angular momentum couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21831)

Conclusion: 提出的方法为qudit多控制酉算子提供了有效的表示和实现途径，尤其在光学系统中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in
terms of many-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is
particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting
connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points
in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to
dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We
describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph
states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit
tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar
two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety
of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of
qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs
single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical
operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum
hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum
representation.

### [7] [Crosstalk-Resilient Quantum MIMO for Scalable Quantum Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21704)
*Seid Koudia,Symeon Chatzinotas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种基于GKP编码的量子多路复用抗串扰策略，通过将离散变量量子信息编码到连续变量模式中，吸收串扰噪声，保证逻辑信息完整传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子通信网络中串扰问题限制了吞吐量的扩展，需解决信号保真度下降的挑战。

Method: 使用GKP编码将离散变量量子信息映射到连续变量模式，分析模式混合干扰，证明噪声可被吸收到不影响逻辑内容的子系统。

Result: 在理想条件下实现完美传输，数值模拟显示在高斯位移噪声下的保真度行为和速率-保真度权衡。

Conclusion: 为量子网络中的抗串扰多路复用奠定了编码理论基础。

Abstract: We address the challenge of crosstalk in quantum multiplexing -an obstacle to
scaling throughput in quantum communication networks. Crosstalk arises when
physically coupled quantum modes interfere, degrading signal fidelity. We
propose a mitigation strategy based on encoding discrete-variable (DV) quantum
information into continuous-variable (CV) bosonic modes using
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. By analyzing the effect of mode-mixing
interference, we show that under specific noise strength conditions, the
interaction can be absorbed into a gauge subsystem that leaves the logical
content intact. We provide rigorous conditions for perfect transmission in the
ideal case, derive the structure of the output codes and prove the existence of
a gauge-fixing decoder enabling recovery of the logical information. Numerical
simulations under displacement Gaussian noise illustrate the fidelity behavior
and rate-fidelity tradeoff. Our results establish a coding-theoretic foundation
for crosstalk-resilient multiplexing in quantum networks.

### [8] [Practical roadmap to measurement-altered criticality in Rydberg arrays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21963)
*Stephen Naus,Yue Liu,Sara Murciano,Pablo Sala,Manuel Endres,Jason Alicea*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在Rydberg原子链中实现测量改变临界性的方案，通过测量特定原子子集来调控量子临界相关性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索弱测量如何改变量子临界波函数的普遍性质，填补实验验证的空白。

Method: 在Ising和三临界Ising相变的Rydberg原子链中，通过周期性测量原子子集，并利用后选择控制测量结果。

Result: 测量显著改变了量子临界相关性，且最显著的结果出现概率高达10%（100个原子的链）。

Conclusion: 该方案实验开销低，仅需调整后处理平均方法，即可展示测量改变临界性的现象。

Abstract: Weak measurements have been predicted to dramatically alter universal
properties of quantum critical wavefunctions, though experimental validation
remains an open problem. Here we devise a practical scheme for realizing
measurement-altered criticality in a chain of Rydberg atoms tuned to Ising and
tricritical Ising phase transitions. In particular, we show that projectively
measuring a periodic subset of atoms alters quantum critical correlations in
distinct ways that one can control via the choice of measured sites and the
measurement outcomes. While our protocol relies on post-selection, the
measurement outcomes yielding the most dramatic consequences occur with
surprisingly large probabilities: O(10%) with chains featuring O(100) sites.
Characterizing the proposed post-measurement states requires only an adjustment
in the post-process averaging of outcomes used to characterize unmeasured
critical states, resulting in minimal additional experimental overhead for
demonstrating measurement-altered criticality.

Abstract: We present a protocol using machine learning (ML) to simultaneously optimize
the quantum error-correcting code space and the corresponding recovery map in
the framework of continuous-time quantum error correction. Given a Hilbert
space and a noise process -- potentially correlated across both space and time
-- the protocol identifies the optimal recovery strategy, measured by the
average logical state fidelity. This approach enables the discovery of recovery
schemes tailored to arbitrary device-level noise.

### [10] [Dipoles and Anyonic Directional Confinement via Twisted Toric Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22025)

Motivation: 研究受限任意子激发及其对系统性质的影响，探索新的激发态和逻辑算符结构。

Method: 通过修改2D环面码哈密顿量，引入空间方向禁闭；扩展到3D模型，利用群上同调扭曲实现。

Result: 发现受限偶极子激发和分形激发，逻辑算符依赖于系统尺寸；3D模型中引入新型偶极-环和偶极-平面子激发。

Conclusion: 受限任意子激发导致新的激发态和逻辑算符结构，为拓扑量子计算和凝聚态物理提供新视角。

Abstract: We introduce a modified 2D toric code Hamiltonian that exhibits explicit
anyon confinement along a single spatial direction. By bounding the motion of
these confined anyons, we obtain dipolar excitations with restricted mobility.
We analyze the resulting logical operators, whose existence depends on the
system size, as well as the structure of gapped boundaries and a tensor network
representation of the ground state. Furthermore, when confinement is enforced
in both directions, fractal-like excitations emerge, resulting in unpaired
logical operators.
  We extend our construction to 3D models, such as the surface code and the
X-cube model, leading to novel dipole-loop and dipole-planon excitations that
arise from bounding confined excitations. These modifications are implemented
through group cohomological twistings--projective representations of finite
groups--with most examples based on Z2xZ2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Lindblad主方程的应用领域扩展，其适用边界变得模糊，新研究领域（如开放量子多体系统和非平衡凝聚态）的出现需要重新评估其有效性。

Method: 通过一系列案例研究和示例，重新审视了Lindblad主方程的三种标准近似，并对比了常见观点与实际情况。

Result: 提出了一个实用检查清单，帮助评估Lindblad框架在特定问题中的适用性。

Conclusion: 本文澄清了Lindblad主方程的适用性误解，为研究者提供了更清晰的指导。

Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a foundational tool for modeling the dynamics
of open quantum systems. As its use has extended far beyond its original
domain, the boundaries of its validity have grown opaque. In particular, the
rise of new research areas including open quantum many-body systems,
non-equilibrium condensed matter, and the possibility to test its limits in
driven-open quantum simulators, call for a critical revision of its regimes of
applicability. In this pedagogical review, we re-examine the folklore
surrounding its three standard approximations (Born, Markov, and Rotating Wave
Approximation), as we build our narrative by employing a series of examples and
case studies accessible to any reader with a solid background on the
fundamentals of quantum mechanics. As a synthesis of our work, we offer a
checklist that contrasts common lore with refined expectations, offering a
practical guideline for assessing the breakdown of the Lindblad framework in
the problem at hand.

Result: 成功展示了QMBS在混沌多体系统中可用于信息传输任务。

Conclusion: QMBS为混沌系统中的量子信息处理提供了新途径，拓展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity
breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body
system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or
long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum
information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate
that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly
interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS
eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show
that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information
transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.

Abstract: A study was performed to determine the extent cavity enhancement may increase
single-photon production while maintaining single-photon purity. It was found
that certain combinations of cavity lifetime and light-matter coupling strength
can lead to carrier-photon correlations that increase single-photon generation
rate while maintaining low 2nd order photon correlation. This study provides
guidance for future emitter-cavity design to achieve high purity and ultrafast
single photon generation.

Conclusion: 该协议为灵活共享多量子比特态和容错纠缠交换提供了新途径。

Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement
swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum
mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this
work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body
entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share
general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body
state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits
typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt
coefficients vanishes. The cost of many-body swapping - arising from
postselection in a third-party measurement - is determined by the 3rd R\'enyi
entanglement entropy of the partitioning. We provide a proof of concept of the
protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new
functionalities, such as flexible sharing of complex multi-qubit states and
fault-tolerant entanglement swapping.

Conclusion: 论文展示了惩罚方法的约束误差界限，并通过数值实验验证了其有效性，同时估计了基于线性组合哈密顿模拟的电路复杂度。

Abstract: Complicated boundary conditions are essential to accurately describe
phenomena arising in nature and engineering. Recently, the investigation of a
potential speedup through quantum algorithms in simulating the governing
ordinary and partial differential equations of such phenomena has gained
increasing attention. We design an efficient quantum algorithms for solving
differential equations with arbitrary boundary conditions. Specifically, we
propose an approach to enforce arbitrary boundary conditions and constraints
through adding a penalty projection to the governing equations. Assuming a
fast-forwardable representation of the projection to ensure an efficient
interaction picture imulation, the cost of to enforce the constraints is at
most $O(\log\lambda)$ in the strength of the penalty $\lambda$ in the gate
complexity; in the worst case, this goes as $O([\|v(0)\|^2\|A_0\| +
\|b\|_{L^1[0;t]}^2)]t^2/\varepsilon)$, for precision $\varepsilon$ and a
dynamical system $\frac{\rm d}{{\rm d}t} v(t) = A_0(t) v(t) + b(t)$ with
negative semidefinite $A_0(t)$ of size $n^d\times n^d$. E.g., for the heat
equation, this leads to a gate complexity overhead of $\widetilde O(d\log n +
\log t)$. We show constraint error bounds for the penalty approach and provide
validating numerical experiments, and estimate the circuit complexity using the
Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation.

*Archisman Ghosh,Satwik Kundu,Swaroop Ghosh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）面临NISQ时代的独特安全挑战，包括模型窃取、数据污染等攻击方式，防御机制利用量子特性应对威胁，但仍需解决噪声平衡等开放性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨量子机器学习在NISQ时代面临的安全威胁及其防御策略，为构建稳健的QML系统提供指导。

Method: 分析QML系统的攻击向量（如模型窃取、数据污染）及防御机制（如量子水印、硬件感知混淆）。

Result: 总结了攻击与防御的最新进展，提出了构建可信QML系统的路线图。

Conclusion: QML安全需平衡噪声与可靠性，解决跨平台攻击，并发展量子-经典信任框架。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical
machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative
tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in
the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines
adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in
cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models.
Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output
extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse
engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks.
Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured
QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership,
and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter
these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive
watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies
disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial
training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing
vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures.
However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing
noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks,
and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes
recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and
practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving
adversarial landscapes.

the first-order process made possible by simultaneous implementation of dipolar
recoupling and adiabatic demagnetization in a reference frame reached out
through nested transformations, firstly from the laboratory frame into the
rotating frame, and then into the spin coordinate system nutating inside its
parent frame. In such a nutating frame, both the static and resonantly rotating
radio-frequency (RF) fields are invisible, and the re-introduced dipolar
interaction provides a secular eigenstate on which dipolar order develops with
assist of an additional portion of RF field designed to implement adiabatic
demagnetization in the nutating frame.

Abstract: Delegated quantum computing (DQC) allows clients with low quantum
capabilities to outsource computations to a server hosting a quantum computer.
This process is typically envisioned within the measurement-based quantum
computing framework, as it naturally facilitates blindness of inputs and
computation. Hence, the overall process of setting up and conducting the
computation encompasses a sequence of three stages: preparing the qubits,
entangling the qubits to obtain the resource state, and measuring the qubits to
run the computation. There are two primary approaches to distributing these
stages between the client and the server that impose different constraints on
cryptographic techniques and experimental implementations. In the
prepare-and-send setting, the client prepares the qubits and sends them to the
server, while in the receive-and-measure setting, the client receives the
qubits from the server and measures them. Although these settings have been
extensively studied independently, their interrelation and whether
setting-dependent theoretical constraints are inevitable remain unclear. By
implementing the key components of most DQC protocols in the respective missing
setting, we provide a method to build prospective protocols in both settings
simultaneously and to translate existing protocols from one setting into the
other.

Abstract: A single excitation in a quantum spin network described by the Heisenberg
model can effect a variety of continuous-time quantum walks on unweighted
graphs, including those governed by the discrete Laplacian, adjacency matrix,
and signless Laplacian. In this paper, we show that the Heisenberg model can
effect these three quantum walks on signed weighted graphs, as well as a
generalized Laplacian equal to the discrete Laplacian plus a real-valued
multiple of the degree matrix, for which the standard Laplacian, adjacency
matrix, and signless Laplacian are special cases. We explore the algorithmic
consequence of this generalized Laplacian quantum walk when searching a
weighted barbell graph consisting of two equal-sized, unweighted cliques
connected by a single signed weighted edge or bridge, with the search oracle
constituting an external magnetic field in the spin network. We prove that
there are two weights for the bridge (which could both be positive, both
negative, or one of each, depending on the multiple of the degree matrix) that
allow amplitude to cross from one clique to the other -- except for the
standard and signless Laplacians that respectively only have one negative or
positive weight bridge -- boosting the success probability from 0.5 to 0.820 or
0.843 for each weight. Moreover, one of the weights leads to a two-stage
algorithm that further boosts the success probability to 0.996.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that offers ease
of training compared to other quantum neural network models, as it does not
rely on gradient-based optimization. Learning is performed in a single step on
the output features measured from the quantum system. Various implementations
of quantum reservoir computing have been explored in simulations, with
different measured features. Although simulations have shown that quantum
reservoirs present advantages in performance compared to classical reservoirs,
experimental implementations have remained scarce. This is due to the challenge
of obtaining a large number of output features that are nonlinear
transformations of the input data. In this work, we propose and experimentally
implement a novel quantum reservoir computing platform based on a circuit
quantum electrodynamics architecture, consisting of a single cavity mode
coupled to a superconducting qubit. We obtain a large number of nonlinear
features from a single physical system by encoding the input data in the
amplitude of a coherent drive and measuring the cavity state in the Fock basis.
We demonstrate classification of two classical tasks with significantly smaller
hardware resources and fewer measured features compared to classical neural
networks. Our experimental results are supported by numerical simulations that
show additional Kerr nonlinearity is beneficial to reservoir performance. Our
work demonstrates a hardware-efficient quantum neural network implementation
that can be further scaled up and generalized to other quantum machine learning
models.

Abstract: Gravitational interaction unavoidably influences atoms and their
electromagnetic radiation field in strong gravitational fields. Theoretical
description of such effects using the curved metric of general relativity is
limited due to the classical nature of the metric and the assumption of the
local inertial frame, where gravitational interaction is absent. Here we apply
unified gravity extension of the Standard Model [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802
(2025)] to solve the Dirac equation for hydrogen-like atoms in the 4xU(1)
gravity gauge field, which appears alongside all other quantum fields. We show
that the gravity gauge field shifts the atomic Dirac energy levels by an amount
that agrees with the experimentally observable gravitational redshift. Our
result for the redshift follows directly from quantum field theory and is
strictly independent of the metric-based explanation of general relativity.
Furthermore, we present how gravitational potential gradient breaks the
symmetry of the electric potential of the atomic nucleus, thus leading to
splitting of otherwise degenerate spectral lines in strong gravitational
fields. Enabling detailed spectral line analysis, our work opens novel
possibilities for future investigations of quantum photonics phenomena in
strong gravitational fields.

Abstract: We address the challenge of certifying quantum behavior with single
macroscopic massive particles, subject to decoherence and finite data. We
propose a hypothesis testing framework that distinguishes between classical and
quantum mechanics based on position measurements. While interference pattern
visibility in single-particle quantum superposition experiments has been
commonly used as a sufficient criterion to falsify classical mechanics, we show
that, from a hypothesis testing perspective, it is neither necessary nor
efficient. Focusing on recent proposals to prepare macroscopic superposition
states of levitated nanoparticles, we show that the likelihood ratio test --
which leverages differences across the entire probability distribution --
provides an exponential reduction in measurements needed to reach a given
confidence level. These results offer a principled, efficient method to falsify
classical mechanics in interference experiments, relaxing the experimental
constraints faced by current efforts to test quantum mechanics at the
macroscopic scale.

Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities have received significant attention as
system-independent measures of correlations in many-body quantum systems, e.g.,
as universal order parameters of synchronization. In this work, we present a
method to determine the macroscopic behavior of the steady-state multipartite
mutual information between $N$ interacting units undergoing Markovian evolution
that is invariant under unit permutations. Using this approach, we extend a
conclusion previously drawn for classical systems that the extensive scaling of
mutual information is either not possible for systems relaxing to fixed points
of the mean-field dynamics or such scaling is not robust to perturbations of
certain system parameters. In contrast, robust extensive scaling occurs for
system relaxing to time-dependent attractors, e.g., limit cycles. We illustrate
the applicability of our method on the driven-dissipative Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
model.

Abstract: Static electric fields have been suggested as a spin to orbital angular
momentum converter in neutrons. Initial calculations showed that the field
required to facilitate significant conversion to longitudinal orbital angular
momentum is prohibitively high for lab power supplies. In this work we exploit
the intra-atomic nuclear electric field in the periodic structure of perfect
single crystals, specifically quartz, which can be orders of magnitude larger
than lab fields. We calculate the Bragg and Laue diffracted wavefunctions of
thermal neutrons and back-diffracted neutrons and demonstrate spin to orbital
angular momentum conversion. Finally we report on a thermal neutron Bragg
diffraction experiment from [110] quartz confirming our results.

Abstract: This paper presents methodological improvements to variational quantum
algorithms (VQAs) for solving multicriteria optimization problems. We introduce
two key contributions. First, we reformulate the parameter optimization task of
VQAs as a multicriteria problem, enabling the direct use of classical
algorithms from various multicriteria metaheuristics. This hybrid framework
outperforms the corresponding single-criteria VQAs in both average and
worst-case performance across diverse benchmark problems. Second, we propose a
method that augments the hypervolume-based cost function with coverage-oriented
indicators, allowing explicit control over the diversity of the resulting
Pareto front approximations. Experimental results show that our method can
improve coverage by up to 40\% with minimal loss in hypervolume. Our findings
highlight the potential of combining quantum variational methods with classical
population-based search to advance practical quantum optimization.

Abstract: Decompositional theories describe the ways in which a global physical system
can be split into subsystems, facilitating the study of how different possible
partitions of a same system interplay, e.g. in terms of inclusions or
signalling. In quantum theory, subsystems are usually framed as sub-C* algebras
of the algebra of operators on the global system. However, most decompositional
approaches have so far restricted their scope to the case of systems
corresponding to factor algebras. We argue that this is a mistake: one should
cater for the possibility for non-factor subsystems, arising for instance from
symmetry considerations. Building on simple examples, we motivate and present a
definition of partitions into an arbitrary number of parts, each of which is a
possibly non-factor sub-C* algebra. We discuss its physical interpretation and
study its properties, in particular with regards to the structure of algebras'
centres. We prove that partitions, defined at the C*-algebraic level, can be
represented in terms of a splitting of Hilbert spaces, using the framework of
routed quantum circuits. For some partitions, however, such a representation
necessarily retains a residual pseudo-nonlocality. We provide an example of
this behaviour, given by the partition of a fermionic system into local modes.

Abstract: Understanding quantum theory's causal structure stands out as a major matter,
since it radically departs from classical notions of causality. We present
advances in the research program of causal decompositions, which investigates
the existence of an equivalence between the causal and the compositional
structures of unitary channels. Our results concern one-dimensional Quantum
Cellular Automata (1D QCAs), i.e. unitary channels over a line of $N$ quantum
systems (with or without periodic boundary conditions) that feature a causality
radius $r$: a given input cannot causally influence outputs at a distance more
than $r$. We prove that, for $N \geq 4r + 1$, 1D QCAs all admit causal
decompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be
decomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in
which its causal structure is compositionally obvious. This provides the first
constructive form of 1D QCAs with causality radius one or more, fully
elucidating their structure. In addition, we show that this decomposition can
be taken to be translation-invariant for the case of translation-invariant
QCAs. Our proof of these results makes use of innovative algebraic techniques,
leveraging a new framework for capturing partitions into non-factor sub-C*
algebras.

Abstract: Long-range entanglement distribution in a quantum network relies on
entanglement swapping at intermediate nodes along a network path to connect
short-range entangled states established over the network edges. The end-to-end
entanglement of a network path obtained via this process determines the utility
of the network path for executing entanglement enabled tasks and for the design
of entanglement routing protocols in the quantum network. Here, we study the
end-to-end entanglement of paths in a quantum network when the edges are
characterised by multi-parameter quantum states that may be considered to be
the output of arbitrary and unknown quantum channels described by the network's
edges. We find that over ensembles of multi-parameter states with fixed
concurrence but varying density matrix elements, the end-to-end entanglement
takes a range of values upper bounded by a function of the concurrence of the
network-edge states. The scaling behaviour of the average end-to-end
entanglement reveals that its distribution gets increasingly concentrated
around the mean as the paths become longer. For a network path of a given
length, the average end-to-end entanglement vanishes for edge concurrence
values below a threshold that increases with the path-length. Whereas, for edge
concurrence values greater than the threshold the average end-to-end
entanglement increases faster with the length of the path. As an implication of
our results, we show that the optimal path for entanglement distribution
between a pair of end nodes, connected by alternate paths with multi-parameter
states along the edges, can be indeterminate given only entanglement guarantees
along the network edges.

Abstract: A quantum computing algorithm is proposed to obtain low-lying excited states
in many-body interacting systems. The approximate eigenstates are obtained by
using a quantum space diagonalization method in a subspace of states selected
from the convergence path of the ADAPT-VQE (adaptive derivative-assembled
pseudo-Trotter Ansatz variational quantum eigensolver) towards the ground state
of the many-body problem. This method is shown to be accurate with only a small
overhead in terms of quantum resources required to get the ground state. We
also show that the quantum algorithm might be used to facilitate the
convergence of the ADAPT-VQE method itself. Successful applications of the
technique are made to like-particle pairing as well as neutron-proton pairing.
Finally, the $H_4$ molecule's dissociation also illustrates the technique,
demonstrating its accuracy and versatility.

Abstract: Understanding the connections between different quantum information protocols
has been proven fruitful for both theoretical insights and experimental
applications. In this work, we explore the relationship between non-local and
prepare-and-measure scenarios, proposing a systematic way to translate
bipartite Bell inequalities into dimensionally-bounded prepare-and-measure
tasks. We identify sufficient conditions under which the translation preserves
the quantum bound and self-testing properties, enabling a wide range of
certification protocols originally developed for the non-local setting to be
adapted to the sequential framework of prepare-and-measure with a dimensional
bound. While the dimensionality bound is not device-independent, it still is a
practical and experimentally reasonable assumption in many cases of interest.
In some instances, we find new experimentally-friendly certification protocols.
In others, we demonstrate equivalences with already known prepare-and-measure
protocols, where self-testing results were previously established using
alternative mathematical methods. Our results unify different quantum
correlation frameworks, and contribute to the ongoing research effort of
studying the interplay between parallel and sequential protocols.

Abstract: According to the Maxwell demon paradigm, additional work can be extracted
from a classical or quantum system by exploiting information obtained through
measurements on a correlated ancillary system. In the quantum setting, the
maximum work extractable via unitary operations in such measurement-assisted
protocols is referred to as daemonic ergotropy. In this work, we explore this
concept in the context of continuous-variable quantum systems, focusing on
Gaussian states and general-dyne (Gaussian) measurements. We derive a general
expression for the daemonic ergotropy and examine two key scenarios: (i)
bipartite Gaussian states where a general-dyne measurement is performed on one
of the two parties, and (ii) open Gaussian quantum systems under continuous
general-dyne monitoring of the environment. Remarkably, we show that for
single-mode Gaussian states, the ergotropy depends solely on the state's energy
and purity. This enables us to express the daemonic ergotropy as a simple
function of the unconditional energy and the purity of the conditional states,
revealing that enhanced daemonic work extraction is directly linked to
measurement-induced purification. We illustrate our findings through two
paradigmatic examples: extracting daemonic work from a two-mode squeezed
thermal state and from a continuously monitored optical parametric oscillator.
In both case we identify the optimal general-dyne strategies that maximize the
conditional purity and, in turn, the daemonic ergotropy.

Abstract: Quantum physics exhibits an intrinsic and private form of randomness with no
classical counterpart. Any setup for quantum randomness generation involves
measurements acting on quantum states. In this work, we consider the following
question: Given a quantum measurement, how much randomness can be generated
from it? In real life, measurements are noisy and thus contain an additional,
extrinsic form of randomness due to ignorance. This extrinsic randomness is not
private since, in an adversarial model, it takes the form of quantum side
information held by an eavesdropper who can use it to predict the measurement
outcomes. Randomness of measurements is then quantified by the guessing
probability of this eavesdropper, when minimized over all possible input
states. This optimization is in general hard to compute, but we solve it here
for any two-outcome qubit measurement and for projective measurements in
arbitrary dimension mixed with white noise. We also construct, for a given
measured probability distribution, different realizations with (i) a noisy
state and noiseless measurement (ii) a noiseless state and noisy measurement
and (iii) a noisy state and measurement, and we show that the latter gives an
eavesdropper significantly higher guessing power.

Abstract: A principal concern in the optimisation of parametrised quantum circuits is
the presence of barren plateaus, which present fundamental challenges to the
scalability of applications, such as variational algorithms and quantum machine
learning models. Recent proposals for these methods have increasingly used the
linear combination of unitaries (LCU) procedure as a core component. In this
work, we prove that an LCU of trainable parametrised circuits is still
trainable. We do so by analytically deriving the expression for the variance of
the expectation when applying the LCU to a set of parametrised circuits, taking
into account the postselection probability. These results extend to incoherent
superpositions. We support our conclusions with numerical results on linear
combinations of fermionic Gaussian unitaries (matchgate circuits). Our work
shows that sums of trainable parametrised circuits are still trainable, and
thus provides a method to construct new families of more expressive trainable
circuits. We argue that there is a scope for a quantum speed-up when evaluating
these trainable circuits on a quantum device.

Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their
recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and
forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and
interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the
reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words,
quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems.
Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and
their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and
geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is
enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by
leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for
designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion
$GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We
analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we
analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise
enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications
on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens
opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series
forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.

Method: 通过量子电路Born机器（QCBM）实现混合和全量子形式的KAN架构，利用预训练残差函数进行转换。

Result: 展示了QuKAN架构的可行性、可解释性和性能。

Conclusion: QuKAN为量子机器学习提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the
representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we
combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully
quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated
to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and
performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics lies at the heart of many issues in science and
engineering, but solving the associated partial differential equations remains
computationally demanding. With the rise of quantum computing, new approaches
have emerged to address these challenges. In this work, we investigate the
potential of quantum algorithms for solving the shallow water equations, which
are, for example, used to model tsunami dynamics. By extending a linearization
scheme previously developed in [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 013036 (2025)] for the
Navier-Stokes equations, we create a mapping from the nonlinear shallow water
equation to a linear system of equations, which, in principle, can be solved
exponentially faster on a quantum device than on a classical computer. To
validate our approach, we compare its results to an analytical solution and
benchmark its dependence on key parameters. Additionally, we implement a
quantum linear system solver based on quantum singular value transformation and
study its performance in connection to our mapping. Our results demonstrate the
potential of applying quantum algorithms to fluid dynamics problems and
highlight necessary considerations for future developments.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of open quantum systems remains a
significant challenge, particularly for Non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate
the profound utility of expressing the environmental correlation function as a
sum of damped sinusoidals within master equations. While not strictly required,
this decomposition offers substantial benefits, crucially reducing the cost of
Lamb-shift and decay rates calculations without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, this approach enables straightforward calculation of Lamb-shift
corrections, bypassing the need for complex principal value integration. We
show that these Lamb-shift effects are demonstrably non-negligible in heat
transport scenarios, and are needed for an accurate description. Unlike in the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan(GKLS) master equation, the non-commuting
nature of the Lamb-shift with the Hamiltonian in non-Markovian descriptions,
coupled with GKLS's inaccuracies at early times, brings the necessity of
Non-Markovian descriptions for finite-time thermodynamics. In the weak coupling
regime, our Master Equation formulations with exponential decomposition achieve
accuracy comparable to numerically exact methods. This methodology
significantly simplifies and accelerates the simulation of non-Markovian
dynamics in open quantum systems, offering a more reliable and computationally
tractable alternative akin to a Global Master Equation.

Abstract: Single-photon purity is one of the most important key metrics of many quantum
states of light. For applications in photonic quantum technologies, e.g.
quantum communication and linear optical quantum computing, a minimization of
the multi-photon error rate is required because of its error-introducing
nature. Ultimately, the purity of state-of-the-art single-photon sources was
found to be limited by spontaneous emission and subsequent reexcitation during
the interaction with the driving field. Here, we demonstrate that even this
fundamental limit to the single-photon purity can be overcome due to the
distinct spectro-temporal properties of the individual photons forming
multi-photon errors. For driving pulses shorter than the emitter lifetime, we
find that photons emitted during the pulse exhibit a significantly broader
spectral shape than the emitter's natural linewidth. Thus, we can selectively
filter out the majority of this instantaneously emitted photon by employing
narrowband spectral filters which reduces the measured degree of second-order
coherence at zero time delay by almost one order of magnitude. This enables a
significant suppression of the multi-photon error rate without detrimental
effects on the desired single-photon emission.

Abstract: Spin-squeezed states are a prototypical example of metrologically useful
quantum states where structured entanglement allows for enhanced sensing with
respect to the one possible using classically correlated particles. Relevant
aspects are both the efficient preparation of spin-squeezed states and the
scalability of estimation precision with the number $N$ of probes. Recently, in
the context of the generation of spin-squeezed states via coupling of
three-level atoms to an optical cavity, it was shown that increasing the
atom-cavity coupling can be detrimental to spin-squeezing generation, an effect
that is not appreciated in the standard second-order cavity removal
approximation. We describe adiabatic elimination techniques to derive an
effective Lindblad master equation up to third order for the atomic degrees of
freedom. We then show through numerical simulations that the spin-squeezing
scalability loss is correctly reproduced by the reduced open system dynamics,
pinpointing the relevant role of higher order contributions.

Abstract: As quantum computing progresses, variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) for
ground-state preparation have become an attractive option in leveraging current
quantum hardware. However, a major challenge in implementing VQE is
understanding whether a given quantum system can even reach the target ground
state. In this work, we study reachability conditions for VQE by analyzing
their inherent symmetries. We consider a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator with
global controls and evaluate its ability to reach ground states for Ising and
Heisenberg target Hamiltonians. Symmetry-based conclusions for a smaller number
of qubits are corroborated by VQE simulations, demonstrating the reliability of
our approach in predicting whether a given quantum architecture could
successfully reach the ground state. Our framework also suggests approaches to
overcome symmetry restrictions by adding additional quantum resources or
choosing different initial states, offering practical guidance for implementing
VQE in quantum simulation architectures. Finally, we illustrate connections to
adiabatic state preparation.

Abstract: We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow to model chemical reaction barriers
with the quantum-classical auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC)
algorithm with quantum tomography using matchgate shadows. The workflow
operates within an accelerated quantum supercomputing environment with the IonQ
Forte quantum computer and NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon Web Services. We present
several algorithmic innovations and an efficient GPU-accelerated execution,
which achieves a several orders of magnitude speedup over the state-of-the-art
implementation of QC-AFQMC. We apply the algorithm to simulate the oxidative
addition step of the nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura reaction using 24 qubits
of IonQ Forte with 16 qubits used to represent the trial state, plus 8
additional ancilla qubits for error mitigation, resulting in the largest
QC-AFQMC with matchgate shadow experiments ever performed on quantum hardware.
We achieve a $9\times$ speedup in collecting matchgate circuit measurements,
and our distributed-parallel post-processing implementation attains a
$656\times$ time-to-solution improvement over the prior state-of-the-art.
Chemical reaction barriers for the model reaction evaluated with active-space
QC-AFQMC are within the uncertainty interval of $\pm4$ kcal/mol from the
reference CCSD(T) result when matchgates are sampled on the ideal simulator and
within 10 kcal/mol from reference when measured on QPU. This work marks a step
towards practical quantum chemistry simulations on quantum devices while
identifying several opportunities for further development.

Abstract: Spectroscopy underpins modern scientific discovery across diverse
disciplines. While experimental spectroscopy probes material properties through
scattering or radiation measurements, computational spectroscopy combines
theoretical models with experimental data to predict spectral properties,
essential for advancements in physics, chemistry, and materials science.
However, quantum systems present unique challenges for computational
spectroscopy due to their inherent complexity, and current quantum algorithms
remain largely limited to static and closed quantum systems. Here, we present
and demonstrate a universal quantum computational spectroscopy framework that
lifts these limitations. Through leveraging coherently controlled quantum
dynamics, our method efficiently reconstructs the spectral information for both
closed and open systems, furtherly for time-dependent driven systems. We
experimentally validate this approach using a programmable silicon-photonic
quantum processing chip, capable of high-fidelity time-evolution simulations.
The versatility of our framework is demonstrated through spectroscopic
computations for diverse quantum systems -- including spin systems,
non-Hermitian systems, and quantum Floquet systems -- revealing novel phenomena
such as parity-time symmetry breaking and topological holonomy that are
inaccessible to conventional spectroscopy or quantum eigenstate algorithms.
{Furthermore, systematic benchmarking of UQCS against existing quantum
algorithms is numerically performed to demonstrate its unprecedented
capabilities and superior performance. This work establishes a noise-robust and
transformative paradigm for quantum spectral analysis.

Abstract: We present a canonical formalism for computing quantum fluctuations of
certain discrete degrees of freedom in systems governed by integrable partial
differential equations with known Hamiltonian structure, provided these models
are classical-field approximations of underlying many-body quantum systems. We
then apply the formalism to both the 2-soliton and 3-soliton breather solutions
of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, assuming the breathers are created
from an initial elementary soliton by quenching the coupling constant. In
particular, we compute the immediate post-quench quantum fluctuations in the
positions, velocities, norms, and phases of the constituent solitons. For each
case, we consider both the white-noise and correlated-noise models for the
fluctuation vacuum state. Unlike previous treatments of the problem, our method
allows for analytic solutions. Additionally, in the correlated-noise case, we
consider the particle-number-conserving (also called
$U(1)$-symmetry-conserving) Bogoliubov modes, i.e., modes with the proper
correction to preserve the total particle number. We find that in most (but not
all) cases, these corrections do not change the final result.

inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped
condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with
opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of
these pairs which demonstrates that vacuum fluctuations seeded the parametric
growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system
continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance
of non-classical features, pointing towards future experimental probes of the
less understood interaction-dominated regime.

Abstract: We report the formation of chiral quantum droplet in a spin-orbit coupled
Bose gas, where the system turns to a self-bound droplet when moving towards a
particular direction and remains gaseous otherwise. The chirality arises from
the breaking of Galilean invariance by spin-orbit coupling, which enables the
system to dynamically adjust its condensation momentum and spin polarization in
response to its velocity. As a result, only towards a specific moving direction
and beyond a critical velocity, the acquired spin polarization can trigger
collective interactions sufficient for self-binding and drive a first-order
transition from gas to droplet. We have mapped out a phase diagram of droplet,
gas and their coexistence for realistic spin-orbit coupled 39K mixtures with
tunable moving velocity and magnetic detuning. Our results have revealed the
emergence of chirality in spin-orbit coupled quantum gases, which shed light on
general chiral phenomena in moving systems with broken Galilean invariance.

Abstract: In one-dimensional bosonic quantum mixtures with SU(2)-symmetry breaking
Hamiltonian, the dynamical evolution explores different particle exchange
symmetry sectors. For the case of infinitely strong intra-species repulsion,
the hallmark of such symmetry oscillations are time modulations of the momentum
distribution [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 183402 (2024)], an observable routinely
accessed in experiments with ultracold atoms. In this work we show that this
phenomenon is robust in strongly interacting quantum mixtures with arbitrary
inter-species to intra-species interaction strength ratio. Taking as initial
state the ground state of the SU(2) symmetric Hamiltonian and time-evolving
with the symmetry breaking Hamiltonian, we analyze how the amplitude and
frequency of symmetry oscillations, and thus of the momentum distribution
oscillations, depend on the strength of the symmetry-breaking perturbation. We
find that the set of symmetry sectors which are coupled during the time
evolution is dictated by the spin-flip symmetry of the initial state and show
that the population of the initial state may vanish periodically, even in the
thermodynamic limit, thus revealing the robustness and universality of the
symmetry oscillations.

Conclusion: 该方法为动态检测超固体的第二声波和刚性提供了可行路径，并可用于孤子形成的研究。

Abstract: We propose a dynamical protocol to probe the rigidity and phase coherence of
dipolar supersolids by merging initially separated fragments in
quasi-one-dimensional (1D) double-well potentials. Simulations based on the
extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveal distinct dynamical signatures across
phases. Supersolids exhibit damped crystal oscillations following barrier
removal, with the damping rate reflecting superfluid connectivity. A
phase-imprinted jump additionally triggers metastable dark solitons, which
excites second sound, as revealed by an out-of-phase drift between the droplet
lattice and the superfluid background. Our results show a realizable path to
dynamically detect the second sound and rigidity of supersolids, as well as to
realize and probe soliton formation.

Abstract: In the paper, thermodynamics of canonical systems is derived from the
multinomial distribution of the occupancy numbers of quantum eigenstates. The
cathegorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) on which the
multinomial distribution is based, should be derived from the maximum entropy
principle, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper
proposes to take instead the Boltzmann distribution as cathegorical
distribution, discussing the reason why the entropy of the
multinomial-Boltzmann distribution should closely approximate the entropy
achieved by the multinomial distribution equipped with the entropy-maximizing
cathegorical distribution. After this, we impose Clausius' equation on the
Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, getting an
unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ that imposes the
energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be
substantially different from the inverse temperature. To support this
unexpected result, the paper presents an example where, with $\beta$ equal to
the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given
temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the
Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. However, the latter is derived from
entropy maximization with constrained expected energy and expected number of
particles, therefore if we plug $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature in the
multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, then the thermodynamics of the canonical
system obtained in this way turns out to be non-compatible with the principle
of maximum entropy.

Result: 在无序相互作用中，仍能观察到有序群体运动、手性和振荡态，以及短程相互作用下自组织小团体的形成。

Conclusion: 这些结果为研究更复杂的非随机非互易相互作用多物种群体模型提供了起点。

Abstract: Flocking is ubiquitous in nature and emerges due to short or long range
alignment interactions among self-propelled agents. Two unfriendly species that
anti-align or even interact non-reciprocally show more complex collective
phenomena, ranging from parallel and anti-parallel flocking over runand chase
behavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective
phenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random
non-reciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here the
extreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal
interactions between the individual particles is considered. As soon as the
alignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions the ordered
flocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random non-reciprocal
interactions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which
the collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range
interactions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques
emerge, in which medium size clusters of particles that have predominantly
aligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic
times. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of
multi-species flocking models with non-random but complex non-reciprocal
inter-species interactions.

Conclusion: 论文为理解“Kac prescription”提供了入门级的物理解释，澄清了常见误解。

Abstract: Systems with long-range interactions have seen a surge of interest in the
past decades. In the wake of this surge, the use of a system size dependent
rescaling, sometimes termed "Kac prescription," of the long-range pair
potential has seen widespread use. This ad hoc modification of the Hamiltonian
makes the energy extensive, but its physical justification and implications are
a frequent source of confusion and misinterpretation. After all, in real
physical $N$-body systems, the pair interaction strength does not scale with
the number $N$ of constituents. This article presents, at an introductory
level, scaling arguments that provide a clear physical interpretation of the
"Kac prescription" for finite systems as well as in the thermodynamic limit.

Abstract: We study the statistics of branching polymers with excluded-volume
interactions, by modeling them as single self-avoiding trees on a generic
regular periodic lattice with coordination number $q$. Each lattice site can be
occupied at most by one tree node, and the fraction of occupied sites can vary
from dilute to dense conditions. By adopting the statistics of directed trees
as a proxy for that of undirected trees without internal loops and by an exact
mapping of the model into a field theory, we compute the entropy and the mean
number of branch-nodes within a mean field approximation and in the
thermodynamic limit. In particular, we find that the mean number of
branch-nodes is independent of both the lattice details and the lattice
occupation, depending only on the associated chemical potential. Monte Carlo
simulations in $d=2,3,4$ provide evidence of the remarkable accuracy of the
mean field theory, more accurate for higher dimensions.

TL;DR: Altermagnets (AM) exhibit properties of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, with La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$ as a real-world example. Despite contradicting GKA rules, AM ordering is its ground state, explained by multiorbital effects and exchange interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Altermagnets (AM) can exist in materials like La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$ despite contradicting the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules.

Method: Combined ab initio and analytical methods to analyze exchange interactions and multiorbital effects in Mn$^{+2}$ ions.

Result: Found that direct exchange and superexchange interactions produce a large antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor coupling, explaining the AM ground state.

Conclusion: The multiorbital character of Mn$^{+2}$ resolves the contradiction with GKA rules, and magnon bands provide experimental signatures for AM.

Abstract: Altermagnets (AM) are a recently introduced type of magnets, with no net
magnetization like antiferromagnets, but displaying a non-relativistic Zeeman
splitting in reciprocal space like ferromagnets. One of the lately discussed
models to realize AM is the inverse Lieb lattice (ILL). Initially suggested as
a purely theoretical construct, the ILL occurs in real materials such as
La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$. However, AM on the ILL requires 90$^\circ$
nearest-neighbor superexchange to be {\it antiferromagnetic} and dominant over
the 180$^\circ$ next-nearest-neighbor superexchange, in apparent contradiction
to the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules. Yet, AM ordering was found to
be the ground state in La$_2$O$_3$Mn$_2$Se$_2$. Combining ab initio and
analytical methods, we determine how direct exchange and superexchange act
together to produce a large antiferromagnetic nearest-neigbor coupling. The
seeming contradiction with the GKA rules is traced back to the multiorbital
character of Mn$^{+2}$ ions. By calculating magnon bands, we identify universal
signatures of the exchange interactions, suggesting experimental fingerprints.

Conclusion: 激发-探测器原理是物理可实现性的必要条件，并可能为充分条件，为分类完美理论提供了初步结果。

Abstract: We study abelian planon-only fracton orders: a class of three-dimensional
(3d) gapped quantum phases in which all fractional excitations are abelian
particles restricted to move in planes with a common normal direction. In such
systems, the mathematical data encoding fusion and statistics comprises a
finitely generated module over a Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[t^\pm]$
equipped with a quadratic form giving the topological spin. The principle of
remote detectability requires that every planon braids nontrivially with
another planon. While this is a necessary condition for physical realizability,
we observe - via a simple example - that it is not sufficient. This leads us to
propose the $\textit{excitation-detector principle}$ as a general feature of
gapped quantum matter. For planon-only fracton orders, the principle requires
that every detector - defined as a string of planons extending infinitely in
the normal direction - braids nontrivially with some finite excitation. We
prove this additional constraint is satisfied precisely by perfect theories of
excitations - those whose quadratic form induces a perfect Hermitian form. To
justify the excitation-detector principle, we consider the 2d abelian anyon
theory obtained by spatially compactifying a planon-only fracton order in a
transverse direction. We prove the compactified 2d theory is modular if and
only if the original 3d theory is perfect, showing that the excitation-detector
principle gives a necessary condition for physical realizability that we
conjecture is also sufficient. A key ingredient is a structure theorem for
finitely generated torsion-free modules over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k} [t^\pm]$, where
$p$ is prime and $k$ a natural number. Finally, as a first step towards
classifying perfect theories of excitations, we prove that every theory of
prime fusion order is equivalent to decoupled layers of 2d abelian anyon
theories.

Abstract: Heavy fermion systems, traditionally realized in rare-earth compounds with
limited tunability, have hindered systematic exploration of correlated quantum
phenomena. Here, we introduce a general strategy for engineering heavy fermions
in incommensurate van der Waals heterostructures by coupling a Mott insulator
(Nb$_3$Cl$_8$) with itinerant electrons (from monolayer graphene),
circumventing strict lattice-matching requirements. Through magnetotransport
and slave spin mean-field calculations, we demonstrate the hybridization gap
($\Delta\approx30$ meV), gate-tunable metal-insulator transition, and
band-selective electron effective mass enhancement, hallmarks of Kondo
coherence. The heterostructure exhibits nearly order-of-magnitude electron
effective mass dichotomy between hybridized and conventional graphene-like
regimes, alongside in-plane magnetic field-induced metal-insulator transitions.
Top gate-temperature phase mapping reveals competing correlated states,
including insulating and hidden-order phases. This work establishes a scalable
platform for designing heavy fermion by replacing the itinerant electron
materials, with implications for engineering topological superconductivity and
quantum criticality in low-dimensional systems.

Abstract: In this work, we investigated the magneto-transport and magnetic properties
of GdGaSi, having non-centrosymmetric tetragonal structure, with space group
$I4_1md$. Our theoretical results are supported by experimental studies.
First-principles calculations reveal that GdGaSi is an antiferromagnetic
semimetallic system, characterized by dominant electron-type charge carriers.
In addition, the possible nontriviality of the crossing at the Fermi energy is
consistent with isostructural LaPtSi-structured materials. The compound shows
robust antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering with a N\'eel temperature of 19 K, and
spin-reorientation signature below $T_N$. The semimetallic nature with positive
magnetoresistance ($\simeq$ 2\% at 2 K and 8 T) is observed from the
magnetotransport data, having electrons as majority charge carrier, established
from the Hall measurements. The strong correlation in magnetism and transport
is supported by various observations, like (1) concordant transitions in $M(T)$
and $\rho (T)$ data, (2) change in the concentration and mobility of electron
below $T_N$, and (3) splitting of Kohler's plots in the two branches across the
transition. Thus, our findings establish GdGaSi as a material with intertwined
magnetic and transport degrees of freedom, within noncentrosymmetric lattice.

Abstract: Magnetism in strongly correlated honeycomb systems with $d^5$ electronic
configuration has garnered significant attention due to its potential to
realize the Kitaev spin liquid state, characterized by exotic properties.
However, real materials exhibit not only Kitaev exchange interactions but also
other magnetic exchanges, which may drive the transition from a spin liquid
phase to a long-range ordered ground state. This work focuses on modelling the
effective spin Hamiltonian for two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb magnetic systems
with $d^5$ electronic configurations. The Hubbard-Kanamori (HK) Hamiltonian
equipped with spin-orbit coupling and electron correlations is considered where
onsite energies and hopping parameters, preserving the crystal symmetry, are
extracted from the first principles Density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. Exact diagonalization (ED) calculations for the HK Hamiltonian on
a two-site cluster are performed to construct the effective magnetic
Hamiltonian. The ground-state magnetic properties are explored using the
semi-classical Luttinger-Tisza approach. As a representative case, the magnetic
ground state of the $d^5$ honeycomb system OsCl$_3$ is investigated, and the
variation of magnetic exchange parameters with respect to the correlation
strength (U) and Hund's coupling ($J_H$) is analyzed. The magnetic ground state
exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering for a chosen value of $U$ and $J_H$,
consistent with DFT results. This study provides insight into the magnetism of
OsCl$_3$ and offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
energy-based methods for calculating exchange interactions for strongly
correlated systems.

Conclusion: 通过耗散Schrieffer-Wolff变换，提出了一个有效的Kondo模型，表明强关联或强耗散会抑制杂质-浴耗散。

Abstract: We study a dissipative version of the Anderson Impurity model, where an
interacting impurity is coupled to a fermionic reservoir and exposed to
Markovian dissipation in the form of two-body losses. Using a self-consistent
hybridization expansion based on the Non-Crossing Approximation (NCA) we
compute the dynamics of the impurity, its steady-state and spectral function.
We show that the interplay between strong Coulomb repulsion and correlated
dissipation gives rise to robust signatures of Kondo physics both at weak and
strong losses. These include a strongly suppressed spin relaxation rate,
displaying a characteristic Kondo-Zeno crossover and a spectral function where
doublon band is quickly destroyed by dissipation while the coherent Kondo peak
remains visible for weak losses, then disappears at intermediate values and
finally re-emerge as the system enters in the Kondo-Zeno regime. As compared to
the case of single particle losses we show that two-body dissipation protects
Kondo physics. The picture obtained with NCA is confirmed by numerical
simulations of exact dynamics on finite-size chains. We interpret these results
using a dissipative Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, which leads to an
effective Kondo model with residual impurity-bath losses which are suppressed
by strong correlations or strong losses.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected solitons observed in various
classes of real magnets. In two-dimensional systems, where the target space of
local magnetization values is the two-sphere $S^2$, skyrmion textures are
classified by the homotopy classes of two-loops $S^2$ in $S^2$: $\Pi_2(S^2)
\cong Z$. Here, we demonstrate that more general topological skyrmion textures
emerge in the classical limit of quantum dimer systems, where the phase space
of the relevant classical theory is $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ (with $N=4$ for the
case of interest), because the relevant second homotopy group,
$\Pi_2(\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}) \cong Z$ for $N\geq 2$, remains unchanged. Building
on the framework established by Zhang et al. (2023), we consider a classical
limit based on SU(4) coherent states, which preserve intra-dimer entanglement.
We show that the zero-temperature phase diagram of frustrated spin-dimer
systems on a bilayer triangular lattice with weak inter-dimer coupling includes
two magnetic-field-induced $\mathbb{CP}^{3}$ skyrmion crystal phases.

Abstract: Twisted WSe$_2$ hosts superconductivity, metal-insulator phase transitions,
and field-controllable Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid transport properties.
In this work, we use dynamical mean-field theory to provide a coherent
understanding of the electronic correlations shaping the twisted WSe$_2$ phase
diagram. We find a correlated metal competing with three distinct
site-polarized correlated insulators; the competition is controlled by
interlayer potential difference and interaction strength. The insulators are
characterized by a strong differentiation between orbitals with respect to
carrier concentration and effective correlation strength. Upon doping, a strong
particle-hole asymmetry emerges, resulting from a Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen-type
charge-transfer mechanism. The associated charge-transfer physics and proximity
to a van Hove singularity in the correlated metal sandwiched between two
site-polarized insulators naturally explains the interlayer potential-driven
metal-to-insulator transition, particle-hole asymmetry in transport, and the
coherence-incoherence crossover in $3.65^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$.

Abstract: Using our developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin
Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting
spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling of normalized
spin current $\tilde{I}_S$ through the interface, and benchmark our approach on
1D Heisenberg chain, with the negative spinon spin current reproduced. In
addition, we find an algebraic scaling $\tilde{I}_S \sim T^{\alpha}$ with
varying exponent $\alpha$ in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the
triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature
SSE, with characteristic spin-current signatures distinguishing different
magnetic phases. Remarkably, we discover a persistent spin current
$\tilde{I}_S$ in the spin supersolid phase, which saturates to a non-zero value
in the low-temperature limit and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated
spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $\tilde{I}_S \sim T^{d/z}$ is
found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These
distinct quantum spin transport traits - particularly the sign reversal and
characteristic temperature dependence in SSE - provide sensitive experimental
probes for investigating spin-supersolid compounds such as
Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Moreover, our results establish spin supersolids as a
tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature
regime.

Abstract: While a predictive theory for unconventional superconductivity in Fe-based
superconductors remains elusive, an extensively debated aspect is the
interaction between phonons and strongly correlated electrons, and its
potential role in the pairing mechanism. Here, through the combination of first
principles dynamical mean field theory calculations and epitaxial growth of the
single-layer FeX (X=Se, S, Te) on SrTiO$_3$ (STO)(001) substrate, which
facilitates the controlled distortion of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron, we
demonstrate an unique superconducting dome where the superconducting gap peaks
at a `magic' angle of the FeX$_4$ tetrahedron and the electron-phonon coupling
(EPC) for the A$_{1g}$ mode is maximized for the FeSe film. Our findings
uncover a significant role of electronic correlations in strengthening Cooper
pairing in unconventional superconductors by enhancing EPC.

Abstract: We introduce a holographic framework for the entanglement Hamiltonian in
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with area-law entanglement, whose
reduced density matrix $\rho \propto e^{-H_e}$ can be treated as a
lower-dimensional mixed state. By replicating $\rho$, we reconstruct the
fixed-point SPT wavefunction, establishing an exact correspondence between the
bulk strange correlator of the (d+1)-dimensional SPT state and the twisted
R\'enyi-N operator of the d-dimensional reduced density matrix. Notably, the
reduced density matrix exhibits long-range or quasi-long-range order along the
replica direction, revealing a universal entanglement feature in SPT phases. As
a colloary, we generalized the framework of twisted R\'enyi-N correlator to
thermal states and open quantum systems, providing an alternative formulation
of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, applicable to both closed and open systems.
Finally, we extend our protocol to mixed-state SPT phases and introduce new
quantum information metrics -- twisted R\'enyi-N correlators of the surgery
operator -- to characterize the topology of mixed states.
