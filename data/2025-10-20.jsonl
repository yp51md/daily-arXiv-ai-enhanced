However,\nin the general scenario where multiple parameters are simultaneously encoded in\na quantum probe, while surpassing the standard quantum limit is possible, its\npractical attainability is severely hindered. This difficulty arises due to the\nfundamental incompatibility among the optimal measurements required for\nestimating different parameters. A naturally multiparameter sensing scenario\nemerges when a network of quantum sensors is spatially distributed, with each\nindividual sensor probing a distinct parameter of interest. The central goal in\nsuch a setting is twofold: first, to surpass the standard quantum limit in\nestimating global properties of the system -- thereby achieving\nquantum-enhanced sensitivity for a given network size -- and second, to\nexplicitly identify the optimal measurement strategies necessary to practically\nattain this quantum advantage. Here, we analytically demonstrate\nquantum-enhanced sensitivity for a broad class of distributed quantum probes,\nincluding cases where the precision scales quadratically or quartically with\nthe sensing resources. We construct the corresponding optimal measurement\nstrategies that achieve the ultimate precision limits -- namely, saturation of\nboth the Holevo and quantum Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bounds. We then apply our framework\nto two concrete scenarios: the simultaneous estimation of multiple\ngravitational accelerations (gravimetry) and coupling strengths across\nspatially separated locations. Feasibility analyses indicate that the proposed\ndistributed quantum-enhanced sensing schemes are within reach of current\nexperimental capabilities."}

Designing schedules that\naccount for such limitations remains a significant challenge. We propose a\ntrust region Bayesian optimization (TuRBO) framework that jointly tunes\nannealing time and Fourier-parameterized schedules. Given a fixed embedding on\na quantum processing unit (QPU), the framework employs Gaussian process\nsurrogates with expected improvement to balance exploration and exploitation,\nwhile trust region updates refine the search around promising candidates. The\nframework further incorporates mechanisms to manage QPU runtime and enforce\nfeasibility under hardware constraints efficiently. Simulation studies\ndemonstrate that TuRBO consistently identifies schedules that outperform random\nand greedy search in terms of energy, feasible solution probability, and chain\nbreak fraction. These results highlight TuRBO as a resource-efficient and\nscalable strategy for annealing schedule design, offering improved QA\nperformance in noisy intermediate-scale quantum regimes and extensibility to\nindustrial optimization tasks."}

In particular, the decay rate towards\nthe steady state is a non-monotonic function of the bath coupling $\\mu$, and an\nanalogue of the Loschmidt echo for dissipative quantum systems undergoes a\nfirst order dynamical phase transitions that eventually becomes a crossover for\nsufficiently large $\\mu$. We provide evidence that these features have their\norigin in the presence of exceptional points in the purely real eigenvalues of\nthe SYK Liouvillian closest to the zero eigenvalue associated with the steady\nstate. An analytic calculation at small $N$, supported by numerical results for\nlarger $N$, reveals that the value of $\\mu \\sim 0.1$ at which the exceptional\npoint corresponding to the longest living modes occurs is close to a local\nmaximum of the decay rate. This value marks the start of a region of anomalous\nequilibration where the relaxation rate diminishes as the coupling to the bath\nbecomes stronger. Moreover, the mentioned change from transition to crossover\nin the Loschmidt echo occurs at a larger $\\mu \\sim 0.3$ corresponding with a\nproliferation of exceptional points in the low energy limit of the Liouvillian\nspectrum. We expect these features to be generic in the approach to equilibrium\nin quantum strongly interacting many-body Liouvillians."}

The central\nchallenges of this approach lie in the design of an expressive ansatz capable\nof representing the exact ground state wavefunction while concurrently being\nefficient to avoid numerical instabilities during the classical optimization.\nOwing to the constraints of current quantum hardware, the ansatz must remain\nsufficiently compact while retaining the flexibility to capture essential\ncorrelation effects. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic\ndynamic ansatz construction strategy in which the dominant operator blocks are\ninitially identified through commutativity screening, combined with an energy\nsorting criteria. Subsequently, the ansatz is progressively expanded in a\nstepwise manner via iterative operator block reordering. To minimize the\noverhead, the higher order correlation terms are incorporated via reduced\nlower-body tensor factorization in each operator block, while the adaptive\nconstruction strategy ensures that the optimization is guided along the optimal\ntrajectory to mitigate potential numerical instabilities due to the presence of\nlocal traps. Benchmark applications to various molecular systems demonstrate\nthat this strategy of progressive operator-block addition achieves accurate\nenergetics with significantly fewer parameters while efficiently bypassing\nlocal traps. Moreover, in strongly correlated regions, such as bond\ndissociation, the method successfully reproduces the ground state, where other\ncontemporary approaches often fail."}

For the\ncompletely disordered case $\\mu = 0$, we show that the universality class of\nlevel statistics depends solely on the parity of system size $L$ and locality\n$k$, classifying these Hamiltonians into the Gaussian Orthogonal (GOE), Unitary\n(GUE), or Symplectic (GSE) ensembles. For couplings with a non-zero mean, we\nmap the Hamiltonians to deformed random matrix ensembles and analyze conditions\nfor a energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state. We find\ntwo distinct regimes: for small locality ($k \\ll \\sqrt{L}$), we show that the\ngap closing threshold scales proportionally with the mean coupling $\\sigma \\sim\n\\mu$, and for large locality ($k \\gg \\sqrt{L}$) a spectral gap exists as long\nas $\\mu > \\sigma$. We analytically derive the expression for this energy gap in\nthe $k \\gg \\sqrt{L}$ limit.

These couplings replace\nboundary field matching conditions. This formalism works both in and out of\nthermal equilibrium, for closed as well as open quantum systems, and provides a\ngeneral dictionary between measurable correlation functions and entanglement\nentropy. $S^{(2q+1)}$ can be analytically continued to calculate the von\nNeumann entropy $S^{\\mathrm{vN}}$.

For interacting theories, we provide rules for\nconstructing all possible Feynman diagrams for $S^{(2q+1)}$.

However, recent\nstudies on various topological phases of matter show that EE from bipartitions\nalone cannot effectively distinguish geometric from topological contributions.\nMotivated by this limitation, we introduce the \\textit{subdimensional\nentanglement entropy} (SEE), defined for lower-dimensional\n\\textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs), as a response theory\ncharacterizing many-body systems via \\textit{virtual} deformations of SES\ngeometry and topology. Analytical calculations for cluster states, discrete\nAbelian gauge theories, and fracton orders reveal distinct subleading SEE terms\nthat sharply differentiate geometric and topological responses. Viewing the\nreduced density matrix on an SES as a mixed state, we establish a\ncorrespondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, identifying\n\\textit{strong} and \\textit{weak} classes. For SESs with nontrivial SEE, weak\nsymmetries act as \\textit{transparent patch operators} of the strong ones,\nforming robust \\textit{transparent composite symmetries} (TCSs) that remain\ninvariant under finite-depth quantum circuits and yield \\textit{strong-to-weak\nspontaneous symmetry breaking} (SW-SSB). By bridging entanglement, mixed-state\nand categorical symmetries, holographic principles of topological order, and\ngeometric-topological responses, SEE provides a unified framework that invites\nfurther theoretical and numerical exploration of correlated quantum matter."}
