Traditional approaches generally rely on sampling multiple intermediate states to ensure sufficient overlap in phase space and are, consequently, computationally expensive. Several generative-model-based methods have recently addressed this challenge by learning a direct bridge between distributions, bypassing the need for intermediate states. However, it remains unclear which approaches provide the best trade-off between efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we systematically review these methods and benchmark selected approaches with a focus on condensed-matter systems. In particular, we investigate the performance of discrete and continuous normalizing flows in the context of targeted free energy perturbation as well as FEAT (Free energy Estimators with Adaptive Transport) together with the escorted Jarzynski equality, using coarse-grained monatomic ice and Lennard-Jones solids as benchmark systems. We evaluate accuracy, data efficiency, computational cost, and scalability with system size. Our results provide a quantitative framework for selecting effective free energy estimation strategies in condensed-phase systems."}

In continuous space and time, two extensively studied examples are Brownian motion in a linear (V-shaped) or a quadratic (U-shaped) potential. The deterministic bias towards the minimum is represented, respectively, by a constant force for the former and by an elastic restoring force that increases proportionally with distance for the latter. Surprisingly, unlike Brownian walks, random walks under focal point potentials in discrete space and time have received little attention. Here, we bridge this gap by analysing the dynamics of lattice random walkers in the presence of a V-shaped potential, both in a finite and an infinite spatial domain, and a finite U-shaped potential. For the V-potential in unbounded space, we find the generating function of the occupation probability and analyse the time dependence of the mean number of distinct sites visited, demonstrating that its long-time growth is logarithmic. We also study the first-passage probability and show that its mean may display a minimum as a function of bias strength, depending on the location of the initial and target sites relative to the focal point. Qualitatively similar dependencies in the first-passage probability and its mean appear for the finite U-potential. As a comparative analysis to the U-potential, we construct the bounded V-potential and superimpose in both cases a resetting process, in which the walker returns at random times to a site distinct from the focal point with some probability. We quantify the different effects of resetting on the steady-state probability and the first-passage dynamics in the two cases, and show a motion-limited regime emerges even for relatively moderate resetting probabilities."}

Here, we directly visualize in-gap electronic states bound to impurities inside an exciton condensate phase of a van der Waals crystal Ta2Pd3Te5, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find that the energies of in-gap states are strongly correlated with the excitonic band gap, which is systematically tuned by local strain and carrier injection.

While the optical frequency comb revolutionized timekeeping by discretizing the continuum of light into countable teeth, and the Quantum Hall Effect standardized resistance via topological invariants, a comparable standard for interaction strength remains elusive. Currently, measuring the coupling constant ($g$) between quantum systems is an estimation problem, inherently subject to drift, noise, and fabrication variance. Here, we introduce Interaction Metrology, a protocol that transforms the measurement of coupling strengths from an analog estimation into a topological counting problem. By engineering a specific class of algebraic catastrophe -- the Unimodal $X_9$ singularity -- in a driven-dissipative lattice, we prove that the system's interaction moduli are topologically forced to take discrete, quantized values, forming a \"Geometric $k$-Comb.\" We derive the universality class of this quantization, showing that it arises from the discrepancy between the Milnor ($μ$) and Tjurina ($τ$) numbers of the effective potential, a strictly non-Hermitian effect forbidden in standard quantum mechanics. Finally, we provide an ab-initio blueprint for a silicon nitride implementation, demonstrating that this quantization is robust against disorder levels exceeding current foundry tolerances. This discovery establishes a universal standard for force sensing and quantum logic gates, enabling the calibration of interaction strengths with topological certainty."}

The energy dispersion of the SSH model is dominated by a gap around zero energy, which suppresses the transmission. This exponential suppression of the transmission with system length is determined by the Lyapounov exponent. Here we find an analytical expression of the Lyapounov as a function of energy in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder. We obtain this result by finding a recurrence relation for the local density, which can be averaged over different disorder configurations. There is excellent agreement between our analytical expression and the numerical results over a wide range of disorder strengths and disorder types.

By gradually reducing SOC strength to zero, the steady state smoothly evolves to a molecular state with directional symmetry breaking. The corresponding dispersion can then be probed experimentally through the center-of-mass momentum distribution of molecules at finite density.

Using a Monte Carlo method, we find a robust $4Q$ bipartite lattice of hedgehogs and antihedgehogs which melts through a first order phase transition at a critical temperature in certain segments of the phase diagram. The density of hedgehogs is a non-linear function of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and a linear function of the multiple-spin chiral interaction which plays the fundamental role of a ``magnetic flux'' or a hedgehog chemical potential.

While the energetic costs of such fluctuation-driven computation have been extensively studied within stochastic thermodynamics, much less is known about its computational complexity, in particular how computation time scales with circuit size. Here, the computation time of explicitly designed Brownian circuits is investigated numerically via the first-passage time to a completed state. For arithmetic circuits such as adders, varying the forward transition rate induces a sharp change in the scaling behavior of the mean computation time, from linear to exponential in circuit size. This change can be interpreted as an easy-hard transition in computational time complexity. The transition suggests that, for meaningful computational tasks, achieving efficient polynomial-time computation generically requires a finite forward bias, corresponding to a nonzero energy input. As a counterexample, it is shown that arbitrary logical operations can be reduced to an effectively one-dimensional stochastic process, for which the zero-bias limit lines within the computationally efficient (easy) regime. However, realizing such a one-dimensional normal form unavoidably leads to an exponential increase in circuit size. These results reveal a fundamental trade-off between computation time, circuit size, and energy input in Brownian circuits, and demonstrate that phase transitions in time complexity provide a natural framework for characterizing the cost of fluctuation-driven computation."}

In contrast, both the droplet and supersolid states exhibit a scissors-mode oscillation, which is effectively damped due to multiple closely spaced frequency components. Notably, we find that this damping rate provides a direct quantitative measure for the rigidity of different phases of a dipolar BEC. Furthermore, there exists a maximum angular deviation of the polarization direction, beyond which the droplet and the supersolid states undergo a permanent deformation i.e., we find an analog of the usual elastic to plastic phase transition of solids. We characterize this transition numerically using the fidelity of the condensate wavefunction with the ground state as well as the droplet width and periodicity of the supersolid density of the condensate which are experimentally accessible. Thus, the technique introduced here can be an important experimental benchmark to identify and characterize the superfluid and solid properties of different phases of dipolar BECs."}

For double power-laws we derive the graphicality of infinite sequences for all possible values of the degree exponents $γ_1$ and $γ_2$, uncovering a rich phase-diagram and pointing out the existence of five qualitatively distinct ways graphicality can be violated. The validity of theoretical arguments is supported by extensive numerical analysis."}

Following the prescient suggestion of P.W. Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:\n  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR), including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers, and\n  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \\gg v_Δ$.\n  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor."}

This paper examines under which conditions a classical fluid model may reproduce the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schrödinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schrödinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can reproduce the mathematical formalism of quantum and relativistic theory in their simplest form, without assuming the postulates principal to those theories."}

We do this by adiabatically connecting a near-ground-state-cooled array of up to 50 single strontium-86 atoms with a Bose-Hubbard superfluid. Through comparison with finite-temperature quantum-Monte-Carlo calculations, we estimate that the entropy per particle of the prepared many-body states is approximately $2 k_B$, and that the achieved temperatures are consistent with a significant superfluid fraction.

Our results successfully reproduce the prominent localized 5f peak observed in ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy around -2.8 eV below the Fermi level in the Am-I phase. While 5f electrons in Am-I and Am-II remain strongly localized, those in Am-III and Am-IV manifest discernible signatures of increased hybridization: a noticeable shift of spectral weight toward the Fermi level, enhanced hybridization strength, and the emergence of distinct multi-peak structures. These changes indicate that 5f electrons begin to participate in bonding and undergo partial delocalization under pressure. Nevertheless, the spectral weight of 5f electrons near the Fermi level in Am-IV remains relatively low, indicating that, compared to U and Pu, Am retains stronger localized 5f electrons even under high pressure. Analysis of the electronic configurations reveals pressure-enhanced valence state fluctuation, characterized by the mixing of 5f5, 5f6, and 5f7 electronic configurations. The X-ray absorption branching ratio further shows that the angular-momentum coupling scheme approaches the jj limit. Additionally, we demonstrate that the stability of the low-symmetry high-pressure phases (Am-III and Am-IV) is governed by a Peierls-like distortion mechanism, which reduces the total energy through symmetry-lowering lattice distortions accompanied by electronic reconstruction.

The approach is demonstrated using analytic simulations with the default.gaussian backend of PennyLane, where quantum states are represented by first and second moments and optimized end-to-end via automatic differentiation. Gaussian loss is modeled as a beam splitter interaction with an environmental vacuum mode of transmissivity $η\\in [0.3,0.95]$, while non-Gaussian phase noise is incorporated through a differentiable Monte-Carlo mixture of random phase rotations with jitter amplitudes $δ\\in [0,0.7]$. The core architecture employs a multi-mode Gaussian circuit consisting of a signal, ancilla, and environment mode. Input states are prepared using squeezing and displacement operations with parameters $(r_s,\\varphi_s,α)=(0.60,0.30,0.80)$ and $(r_a,\\varphi_a)=(0.40,0.10)$, followed by an entangling beam splitter with angles $(θ,φ)=(0.70,0.20)$.

While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level of higher statistical moments remains a daunting challenge, with analytic progress largely confined to random quantum circuit models or fine-tuned systems exhibiting space-time duality. Here we study how much randomness can be dynamically generated by generic quantum-chaotic evolution under physical, non-random Hamiltonians. Combining theoretical insights with numerical simulations, we show that for broad classes of initially unentangled states, the dynamics become effectively Haar-random well before the system can ergodically explore the physically accessible Hilbert space. Both local and highly nonlocal observables, including entanglement measures, equilibrate to their Haar expectation values and fluctuations on polynomial timescales with remarkably high numerical precision, and with the fastest randomization occurring in regions of parameter space previously identified as maximally chaotic. Interestingly, this effective randomization can occur on timescales linear in system size, suggesting that the sub-ballistic growth of Renyi entropies typically observed in systems with conservation laws can be bypassed in non-random Hamiltonians with an appropriate choice of initial conditions."}

We review the three qubit GHZ Mermin device, make its generalization to four qubits, and then construct analogous Mermin devices for the generalized Dicke states of three and four qubits. As a result of studying if their operations can be fully explained by Mermin's instructional sets, we show that the GHZ and Dicke states of three qubits and the GHZ state of four qubits do not allow such a description. However, among the two generalized Dicke states of four qubits, one does allow and the other does not allow such a description."}

Unlike previous schemes relying on externally engineered potentials or pump-loss landscapes, our approach reveals that the intrinsic nonlinear hydrodynamics of polariton fluids alone can lead to horizon formation. Using Whitham modulation theory and numerical simulations, we characterize the transition between subsonic and supersonic regimes and estimate the corresponding surface gravity and Hawking temperature. This mechanism opens a new route toward realizing polariton black holes and studying analogue gravitational effects, including Hawking-like emission, in Bose-Einstein quantum liquids."}

In contrast, for spatially separated dual spin currents, the time-reversal-invariant vector chirality emerges as a critical factor governing magnetization dynamics. Here, we investigate field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in an altermagnet RuO2/ferromagnet/heavy metal Pt trilayer, driven by chiral dual spin currents (CDSC). We demonstrate that the chirality of these dual spin currents acts as the deterministic role in breaking out-of-plane symmetry. Leveraging the intrinsic spin-splitting effect of the d-wave altermagnet to generate an x-polarized spin component, the interplay of non-collinear spin currents from two adjacent layers induces a helical magnetic texture within the intermediate layer. The resulting intralayer exchange coupling manifests as an effective in-plane magnetic field, facilitating deterministic switching. This distinct physical picture, validated by switching measurements and micromagnetic simulations, reveals that the switching polarity is dictated by chirality rather than charge current polarity. Characterized by the novel symmetry and low power consumption, CDSC offers a promising paradigm for next-generation high-performance spintronic architectures."}

However, quantum hardware roadmaps indicate that physical qubit numbers will remain limited in the foreseeable future, leading to residual logical errors that limit the size and accuracy of achievable computations. Recent work suggested logical error mitigation (LEM), which applies known error mitigation (EM) methods to logical errors, eliminating their effect at the cost of a runtime overhead. Improving the efficiency of LEM is crucial for increasing the logical circuit volumes it enables to execute.\n  We introduce syndrome-aware logical error mitigation (SALEM), which makes use of the syndrome data measured during error correction, when mitigating the logical errors. The runtime overhead of SALEM is exponentially lower than that of previously proposed LEM schemes, resulting in significantly increased circuit volumes that can be executed accurately. Notably, relative to the routinely used combination of error correction and syndrome rejection (post-selection), SALEM increases the size of reliably executable computations by orders of magnitude. In this practical setting in which space and time are both resources that need to be optimized, our work reveals a surprising phenomenon: SALEM, which tightly combines EC with EM, can outperform physical EM even above the standard fault-tolerance threshold. Thus, SALEM can make use of EC in regimes of physical error rates at which EC is commonly deemed useless."}

Such phase slips persist even at zero temperature due to a mechanism known as quantum activation \\cite{QuantumActivation}. In contrast to conventional tunneling, the quantum activation is described by a {\\em real-time} instanton trajectory in the complexified phase space of the system. In this work, we show that the phase-slip rate is exponentially sensitive to weak AC perturbations.

However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:\n  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR), including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers, and\n  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \\gg v_Δ$.\n  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor."}

The second Rényi entropy is readily measured using two-copy protocols and is often used as a proxy for the von Neumann entanglement entropy, where it is assumed to track its asymptotic scaling. However, Sugino and Korepiny (Int. J. Mod. Phys. B 32, 1850306 (2018)) revealed that in the ground state of some spin models, the scaling of the von Neumann and second Rényi entropies varies from power law to logarithmic scaling as a function of the Rényi index. By constructing a number-conserving many-body state with only two local degrees of freedom, we obtain a Rényi-index-dependent change in the leading entanglement scaling: the second Rényi entropy remains logarithmic while the von Neumann entropy is parametrically larger. We then introduce a symmetry-aware lower bound on the von Neumann entropy built from charge-resolved second Rényi entropies and the subsystem charge distribution. Comparing this bound to the total second Rényi entropy provides a practical diagnostic for anomalous entanglement scaling from experimentally accessible data."}

By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration."}

Using the Cole-Hopf transformation, the nonlinear Burgers equation is mapped to a diffusion equation, discretized on uniform grids, and encoded into a quantum state whose time evolution is approximated via Trotterized nearest-neighbor circuits implemented in Qiskit. Quantum simulations are executed on noisy Aer backends and IBM superconducting quantum devices and are benchmarked against high-accuracy classical solutions obtained using a Krylov-based solver applied to the corresponding discretized Hamiltonian. From measured quantum amplitudes, we reconstruct the velocity field and evaluate physical and numerical diagnostics, including the L2 error, shock location, and dissipation rate, both with and without zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). To enable data-driven error mitigation, we construct a large parametric dataset by sweeping viscosity, time step, grid resolution, and boundary conditions, producing matched tuples of noisy, ZNE-corrected, hardware, and classical solutions together with detailed circuit metadata. Leveraging this dataset, we train an attention-based graph neural network that incorporates circuit structure, light-cone information, global circuit parameters, and noisy quantum outputs to predict error-mitigated solutions. Across a wide range of parameters, the learned model consistently reduces the discrepancy between quantum and classical solutions beyond what is achieved by ZNE alone. We discuss extensions of this approach to higher-dimensional Burgers systems and more general quantum partial differential equation solvers, highlighting learned error mitigation as a promising complement to physics-based noise reduction techniques on NISQ devices."}

Broken symmetries in such a system can lead to inequivalent lattice sites, and magnetic impurities may interact selectively with particular orbitals or sublattices.

Here, we explore the behavior of individual Fe adatoms on a cluster-Mott charge-density-wave (CDW) system of 1T-TaS2 utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and density functional theory (DFT). Our measurements uncover pronounced site-dependent electronic states of CDW clusters with Fe adatoms, indicating distinct local coupling to cluster-Mott states. DFT calculations identify three distinct types of interactions; hybridization with localized correlated electrons, distorting the CDW cluster, and charge transfer. In particular, the hybridization of Fe 3d and half-filled Ta 5dz2 orbitals suppresses the Mott insulating state for an adatom at the center of a CDW cluster. While the results underscore a crucial role of the direct orbital hybridization and the limitation of the prevailing single-site Kondo impurity model, they suggest the possibility of controlling entangled interactions separately in a cluster Mott insulator."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Altermagnets exhibit spin-split electronic band structures despite having zero net magnetization, making them attractive for field-free spintronic applications. In this work, we show that a finite rectangular altermagnetic sample can acquire a net spin polarization purely due to its geometry. This effect arises from the interplay between the anisotropic, spin-resolved Fermi contours of an altermagnet and the discrete sampling of momentum space imposed by unequal sample dimensions. By explicitly counting occupied states, we demonstrate that rectangular samples with $L_x \\neq L_y$ host a finite spin polarization, which vanishes in the symmetric limit $L_x=L_y$ and in the thermodynamic limit. We further show that this geometry-induced spin polarization can be directly probed in transport measurements. In the tunneling regime, the ratio of spin to charge conductance exhibits characteristic square-like patterns as a function of sample dimensions, faithfully reflecting the underlying spin polarization. In addition, transport across ferromagnet--altermagnet--ferromagnet junctions reveals an asymmetric magnetoresistance with respect to reversal of the Zeeman field, providing an independent transport signature of the finite spin polarization. Our results establish geometry as an effective control parameter for spin polarization in altermagnets and suggest a viable route for exploiting finite-size effects in mesoscopic altermagnetic spintronic devices."}

The Fourier transform appears as a fibrewise unitary transition function, so that the standard position-momentum duality is made precise as a change of coordinates on a single geometric object.

The compound Ba$_2$DyRuO$_6$ is reported to exhibit a single magnetic transition, in sharp contrast to most of the other rare-earth (R) members in this family, A$_2$RRuO$_6$ (A = Ca/Sr/Ba), which typically show magnetic ordering of the Ru ions, followed by R-ion ordering.

In this work, we present experimental evidence for a predicted, unique spin valley locked electronic state generated by Bi zigzag chains in the layered compound BaMnBi2. We observe remarkable quantum transport properties in this material, including a stacked quantum Hall effect (QHE) and a nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). From the analysis of the QHE, we identify a spin valley degeneracy of four, while the NLHE provides supporting evidence for the anticipated valley contrasted Berry curvature, a typical signature of a spin valley locked state. This spin valley locked state contrasts with that observed in the sister compound BaMnSb2, where the degeneracy is two. This difference arises from significant variations in their orthorhombic crystal structures and spin orbit coupling.

Tailored molecules on a Si(100) surface image the probe apex, and the usual challenge of understanding the probe structure is effectively solved. The molecules can also react with the probe, with the two sides of the tunnel junction acting as reagents positioned with sub-angstrom precision. This allows abstraction or donation of atoms from or to the probe apex. We demonstrate this by using a novel alkynyl-terminated molecule to reproducibly abstract hydrogen atoms from the probe.

In this work, we propose q-iPrune, a one-shot structured pruning framework grounded in the algebraic structure of $q$-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry.\n  Unlike prior heuristic or gradient-based pruning methods, q-iPrune formulates redundancy directly at the gate level. Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity through state overlaps on a task-relevant ensemble. A gate is removed only when its replacement by a subgroup representative provably induces a bounded deviation on all task observables.\n  We establish three rigorous theoretical guarantees. First, we prove completeness of redundancy pruning: no gate that violates the prescribed similarity threshold is removed. Second, we show that the pruned circuit is functionally equivalent up to an explicit, task-conditioned error bound, with a closed-form dependence on the redundancy tolerance and the number of replaced gates. Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.\n  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $λ$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance. Experiments on standard quantum machine learning benchmarks demonstrate that q-iPrune achieves substantial gate reduction while maintaining bounded task performance degradation, consistent with our theoretical guarantees."}

Molecular dynamics (MD) naturally captures ballistic transport and phonon nonequilibrium, but has not been applied to hot-spot problems due to computational cost. Here, we perform the first MD simulations of hot-spot heat transfer across ballistic-diffusive regimes and benchmark them against FEM. We find that FEM using bulk thermal conductivity $κ_0$ significantly underestimates hot-spot temperature, even when the channel thickness is ~10 times the phonon mean free path, indicating persistent non-Fourier effects. We introduce a size-dependent \"best\" conductivity, $κ_{\\mathrm{best}}$, using which FEM can reproduce MD hot-spot temperatures with high fidelity. We further decompose the MD-extracted thermal resistance into: (i) diffusive spreading, (ii) cross-plane ballistic, (iii) heat-carrier selective heating, and (iv) residual 3D ballistic-spreading resistances, and quantify each contribution. The resulting framework offers a practical route to embed non-Fourier physics into FEM for hot-spot prediction, reliability assessment, and thermally aware design of next-generation transistors."}

We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, ν_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\\times_{ω_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones.

The device is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, whose complex eigenvalues encode the energy (real part) and the broadening (imaginary part) of the Andreev quasi-bound states. When extending the Andreev current formula to the non-Hermitian case, a novel contribution arises that is proportional to the phase derivative of the levels broadening. This term becomes particularly relevant in the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectrum, but its experimental detection is not straightforward. We identify optimal Andreev spectrum configurations where this novel current contribution can be clearly highlighted, and we outline an experimental protocol for its detection. We point out that the phase dependence in the levels imaginary part originates from the breaking of a time-reversal-like symmetry. In particular, spectral configurations in the broken phase of the symmetry and without EPs can be obtained, where this novel contribution can be easily resolved. The proposed protocol would allow to probe for the first time a fingerprint of non-Hermiticity in open junctions that is not strictly related to the presence of EPs."}

In continuous variable (CV) regime, squeezed state has been exploited to implement deterministic phase estimation. It is however, often restricted by fragility of quantum states. The quantum phase estimation sensitivity of squeezed state is significantly affected by loss or detection inefficiency, which restrict its applications. This issue can be solved by using a method of parametric amplification of squeezed state \\cite{OPA}. In this work, we implement multi-phase estimation with optical parametric amplification of entanglement generated from squeezed states. We find multi-phase estimation sensitivity is robust against loss or detection inefficiency, where we use two-mode Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled state and four-mode cluster state for analysis. Our work provides a method for realizing large-scale quantum metrology in real-world applications against loss or detection inefficiency."}

This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials."}

The magnetotransport response is governed by Landau quantization and the emergence of multiple chiral Landau levels associated with higher-order Weyl nodes. These anomaly-active modes have unidirectional dispersion fixed by the node's monopole charge and dominate charge transport. As the magnetic field increases, individual chiral branches successively cross the Fermi energy, producing discrete slope changes in the longitudinal conductivity and a step-like negative magnetoresistance. This quantized evolution provides a direct experimental signature of multi-Weyl topology. Bulk Landau levels contribute only at very low fields due to strong disorder scattering and do not affect the anomaly-driven regime. Our results establish a unified, fully quantum-mechanical framework in which negative magnetoresistance arises from the discrete Landau-quantized spectrum and microscopic impurity scattering, beyond semiclassical anomaly descriptions."}

As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\\si{\\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \\pm 38)$~\\si{\\nano\\meter} in the device.

In this work, we demonstrate that in the presence of geometric disorders, such as random bond dilution, a robust metal can emerge in a Chern insulator with particle-hole symmetry. The metallic phase is realized when the broken links are weakly stitched via concomitant insertion of $π$ fluxes in the plaquettes. These nucleate low-energy manifolds, which can provide percolating conduction pathways for fermions to elude localization. This diffusive metal, unlike those in superconductors, can carry charge current and even anomalous Hall current. We investigate the transport properties and show that while the topological insulator to Anderson insulator transition exhibits the expected Dirac universality, the metal insulator transition displays a different critical exponent $ν\\approx 2$ compared to a disordered topological superconductor, where $ν\\approx 1.4$.

Here, we directly visualize in-gap electronic states bound to impurities inside an exciton condensate phase of a van der Waals crystal Ta2Pd3Te5, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find that the energies of in-gap states are strongly correlated with the excitonic band gap, which is systematically tuned by local strain and carrier injection. Our theoretical analyses reveal that these in-gap states are induced by charge dipoles associated with Ta vacancies through a charge-exciton version of the YSR mechanism. Our findings establish both the YSR physics in exciton condensates and a novel microscopic tool to probe and control quantum properties in exciton condensates persisting up to room temperature."}

Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian version in which the spin-flip rate differs between the two spin directions. While the naive expectation is that non-Hermiticity might suppress coherent phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, we find that when the facilitating direction of the spin is disfavored, the oscillations are instead \\emph{enhanced}, decaying much slower than in the PXP limit. We demonstrate that this can be understood through a similarity transformation that maps our model to the standard PXP model, revealing that the oscillations are enhanced versions of the PXP scars.

In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy. By combining the standard TLS theory with a thermal conductance model, the measured power-dependent response is quantitatively reproduced and readout-enhanced relaxation damping from off-resonant TLSs is identified as the primary mechanism limiting mechanical coherence.

We build up a general framework for systematically classifying 3D interacting TSCs protected by crystalline symmetries together with discrete internal symmetries. We first establish a complete classification for fermionic symmetry protected topological phases (FSPT) with purely discrete internal symmetries, which determines the crystalline case via the crystalline equivalence principle. Using domain wall decoration, we obtain classification data and formulas for generic FSPTs, what are suitable for systematic computation. The four layers of decoration data $(n_1, n_2, n_3, ν_4)$ characterize a 3D FSPT with symmetry $G_b\\times_{ω_2}Z_2^f$, corresponding to $p+ip$, Kitaev chain, complex fermion, and bosonic SPT layers. Inspired by previous works, a crucial aspect is the $p+ip$ layer, where classification involves two possibilities: anti-unitary and infinite-order symmetries (e.g., translation). We show the former maps to some mirror FSPT classification with the mirror plane decorated by a $p+ip$ superconductor, while the latter is determined by the free part of $H^1(G_b, Z_T)$, corresponding to weak TSCs. Another key point is the Kitaev chain decoration for the anti-unitary symmetries, which differs essentially from unitary ones.

The three-qubit W-state is one such example where every state is robust to single-qubit loss.

Here, we focus on the distribution of a non-symmetric version of such states, namely $W_{\\mathrm{mod}}$ states. These states belong to the W-class, and have one ebit of entanglement across a specific bipartition, enabling deterministic teleportation and superdense coding. In particular, we describe a few protocols through which these multipartite entangled states can be distributed {\\it deterministically} in a quantum network by first preparing them locally in a central node and then transmitting individual qubits to the end nodes. We analyse the performance of these protocols based on the fidelity of the final distributed state, considering all types of noises that can act during the distribution.

For pure single-qubit inputs, a particular choice of the single-qubit unitary yields globally chaotic, strongly mixing dynamics that explores the entire Bloch sphere, providing a physical realization of ergodic behavior in a complex map. We extend the analysis to realistic, noisy preparation by considering mixed initial states and the induced nonlinear evolution inside the Bloch sphere. Numerical results show that the maximally mixed state is an attractor for mixed inputs, although many trajectories exhibit transient increases in purity before ultimately converging. To quantify robustness against noise, we introduce a practical notion of quasi-ergodicity: ensembles prepared in a small angular patch at fixed purity rapidly spread to cover all directions, while the purity gradually decreases toward its minimal value. By varying the final single-qubit gate, we identify a broad family of protocols that remain ergodic-like for pure states, supported by consistent diagnostics including the absence of attracting cycles, agreement of time and ensemble statistics, rapid spreading from localized regions, and exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. Away from the special globally mixing case, the mixed-state dynamics can change qualitatively: for most ergodic-like parameters, a finite subset of noisy inputs is driven toward purification rather than complete mixing, demonstrating the coexistence of statistical mixing and purification within a single iterated protocol."}

The Lie-algebraic criteria of controllability imply that such an array is not completely controllable, but satisfies the conditions for subspace controllability on any subspace with a fixed number of excitations. Therefore, a qubit array described by the model under consideration is state-to-state controllable for an arbitrary choice of initial and final states that have the same Hamming weight. This limited controllability is exploited here for the time-optimal dynamical generation of an $a$-excitation Dicke state $|D^{N}_{a}\\rangle$ ($a=1,2,\\ldots, N-1$) in a linear array with $N$ qubits starting from a generic Hamming-weight-$a$ product state. To dynamically generate the desired Dicke states -- including $W$ states $|W_{N}\\rangle$ as their special ($a=1$) case -- in the shortest possible time with a single local $Z$ control, we employ an optimal-control scheme based on the dressed Chopped RAndom Basis (dCRAB) algorithm. We optimize the target-state fidelity over the expansion coefficients of smoothly-varying control fields in a truncated random Fourier basis; this is done by combining Nelder-Mead-type local optimizations with the multistart-based clustering algorithm that facilitates searches for global extrema. In this manner, we obtain the optimal control fields for Dicke-state preparation in arrays with up to $N=9$ qubits. Based on our numerical results, we find that the shortest possible state-preparation times scale quadratically with $N$. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our control scheme against small control-field deviations from the optimal values."}

Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian version in which the spin-flip rate differs between the two spin directions. While the naive expectation is that non-Hermiticity might suppress coherent phenomena such as quantum many-body scars, we find that when the facilitating direction of the spin is disfavored, the oscillations are instead \\emph{enhanced}, decaying much slower than in the PXP limit. We demonstrate that this can be understood through a similarity transformation that maps our model to the standard PXP model, revealing that the oscillations are enhanced versions of the PXP scars.

Accurate modeling of these devices is essential for predicting performance, improving design, and optimizing control. Many modeling approaches currently rely on lumped circuit approximations or other simplified treatments that can be limited in resolving the interplay between the qubit dynamics and the electromagnetic circuitry, leading to significant experimental deviations from numerical predictions at times. To address many of these limitations, methods that self-consistently solve the Schrödinger equation for qubit dynamics with the classical Maxwell's equations have been developed and shown to accurately predict a wide range of effects related to superconducting qubit control and readout. Despite these successes, these methods have not been able to consider multi-qubit effects that give rise to qubit-qubit entanglement. Here, we address this by rigorously deriving how multi-qubit coupling effects between transmon qubits can be embedded into Maxwell-Schrödinger methods. To support this, we build on earlier first-principles derivations of Maxwell-Schrödinger methods for the specific case of two transmon qubits coupled together through a common electromagnetic system in the dispersive regime. To aid in validating aspects of the Maxwell-Schrödinger framework, we also provide a new interpretation of Maxwell-Schrödinger methods as an efficient simulation strategy to capture the class of non-Markovian open quantum system dynamics. Our results demonstrate that these effects can give rise to strong classical crosstalk that can significantly alter multi-qubit dynamics, which we demonstrate for the cross-resonance gate. These classical crosstalk effects have been noted in cross-resonance experiments, but previous quantum theory and device analysis could not explain their origin."}

Our results show that while the Coulomb interaction plays a pivotal role in significantly enhancing quantum phase synchronization by facilitating energy exchange and phase coherence, it has little impact on complete and $φ$-synchronization. This indicates that amplitude and frequency locking are primarily determined by the optical driving, whereas phase alignment depends critically on inter-resonator coupling. We also demonstrate that the oscillations of the two optical cavities, which are indirectly coupled via the mechanical resonators, can become aligned over time, resulting in classical synchronization. These findings provide a robust mechanism for controlling collective quantum dynamics and offer a foundation for applications in quantum communication, precision sensing, and the development of synchronized quantum networks."}

This paper develops this perspective for circuit QED dispersive readout through a first-principles derivation starting from the circuit Lagrangian. The transmon qubit terminating a transmission line resonator provides a frequency-dependent boundary condition whose pole structure encodes the qubit's transition frequencies; different qubit states yield different resonator frequencies. Two approximations, linear response and a pole-dominated expansion valid near resonance, reduce the boundary function to a rational form in the Sturm-Liouville eigenparameter. The extended Hilbert space of the Fulton-Walter spectral theory then provides a framework for the dressed-mode eigenvalue problem conditional on the qubit state. The dispersive shift and vacuum Rabi splitting emerge from the transcendental eigenvalue equation, with the residues determined by matching to the splitting: $δ_{ge} = 2Lg^2ω_q^2/v^4$, where $g$ is the vacuum Rabi coupling. A level repulsion theorem guarantees that no dressed mode frequency coincides with a transmon transition. For two qubits with matched dispersive shifts, odd-parity states become frequency-degenerate; true parity-only measurement requires engineered suppression of linear dispersive terms."}

Using semiclassical dynamics, Majorana representations, and Husimi-Q distributions, we analyze the structure and metrological properties of the resulting states.

In contrast to the conventional Duffing oscillator, the observed nonlinearity exhibits a mixed reactive-dissipative character. Notably, the reactive effect can manifest as either a softening or hardening of the mechanical resonance, depending on the ratio of thermal to phonon energy.

Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures."}

An exponentially scaling DLA dimension is associated with the presence of so-called barren plateaus (BP) in the optimization landscape, which renders training intractable. In this work, we investigate the DLA of QAOA applied to the canonical MaxCut, for both weighted and unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, we show that when the weights are drawn from a continuous distribution, the DLA dimension grows as $Θ(4^n)$ almost surely for all connected graphs except paths and cycles. In the more common unweighted setting, we show that asymptotically all but an exponentially vanishing fraction of graphs have $Θ(4^n)$ large DLA dimension. The entire simple Lie algebra decomposition of the corresponding DLAs is also identified, from which we prove that the variance of the loss function is $O(1/2^n)$, implying that QAOA on these weighted and unweighted graphs all suffers from BP. Moreover, we give explicit constructions for families of graphs whose DLAs have exponential dimension, including cases whose MaxCut is in $\\mathsf P$. Our proof of the unweighted case is based on a number of splitting lemmas and DLA-freeness conditions that allow one to convert prohibitively complicated Lie algebraic problems into amenable graph theoretic problems. These form the basis for a new algorithm that computes such DLAs orders of magnitude faster than previous methods, reducing runtimes from days to seconds on standard hardware. We apply this algorithm to MQLib, a classical MaxCut benchmark suite covering over 3,500 instances with up to 53,130 vertices, and find that, ignoring edge weights, at least 75% of the instances possess a DLA of dimension at least $2^{128}$."}

Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability.

Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing.

Quantum correlations are quantified using negativity to capture entanglement and quantum discord based on linear entropy to characterize more general nonclassical correlations. Our results show that both thermal fluctuations and phase noise lead to a monotonic degradation of quantum correlations, with increasing temperature accelerating coherence loss and inducing entanglement sudden death at finite temperatures. While negativity vanishes abruptly under sufficiently strong noise, quantum discord persists beyond the entanglement threshold, revealing residual quantum correlations in mixed states.

Across 1-128 QPUs and 2,500 trials per point, ModEn-Hub-style orchestration sustains about 90% teleportation success while the baseline degrades toward about 30%, at the cost of higher average entanglement attempts (about 10-12 versus about 3). These results provide clear, high-level evidence that adaptive resource orchestration in the ModEn-Hub enables scalable and efficient quantum-HPC operation on near-term hardware."}

The concept of a PT transition has been extended to Markovian open quantum systems, which are described by the GKSL equation. Interestingly, the PT transition in many-body Markovian open quantum systems, the so-called \\textit{Lindbladian PT (L-PT) phase transition}, is closely related to two classes of exotic nonequilibrium many-body phenomena: \\textit{continuous-time crystals} and \\textit{non-reciprocal phase transitions}. In this review, we describe the recent advances in the study of L-PT phase transitions. First, we define PT symmetry in three distinct contexts: non-Hermitian systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, and Markovian open quantum systems, highlighting the interconnections between these frameworks. Second, we develop mean-field theories of L-PT phase transitions for collective-spin systems and for bipartite bosonic systems with particle-number conservation. Within these classes of models, we show that L-PT symmetry can induce a breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry down to a discrete one, leading to persistent periodic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the L-PT phase transition point is typically \\textit{a critical exceptional point}, where multiple collective excitation modes with zero excitation spectrum coalesce. These findings establish an explicit connection to continuous-time crystals and non-reciprocal phase transitions. Third, going beyond the mean-field theory, we analyze statistical and quantum properties, such as purity and quantum entanglement indicators of time-independent steady states for several specific models with the L-PT symmetry. Finally, we discuss future research directions for L-PT phase transitions."}

We show that the Toffoli count can be reduced to at most n. The Toffoli depth can also be reduced to O(1), at the cost of 2n Toffoli gates, even without using any ancilla or measurement. In fact, using a measurement-based uncomputation, the Toffoli depth can be further reduced to 1.

Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient troughs. This refers to a non-monotonic convergence of the gradients, which may become very small even though the minimum energy has not been reached. This results in difficulties finding the right operators to add to the ansatz, due to the limited number of shots and statistical uncertainties, leading to stagnation in the circuit structure optimization. In this paper, we propose ways to detect and mitigate this phenomenon. Leveraging the non-commutative algebra of the ansatz, we develop heuristics for determining where to insert new operators into the circuit. We find that gradient troughs are more likely to arise when the same locations are used repeatedly for new operator insertions. Our novel protocols, which add new operators in different ansatz positions, allow us to escape gradient troughs and thereby lower the measurement cost of the algorithm. This approach achieves an effective balance between cost and efficiency, leading to faster convergence without compromising the low circuit depth and gate count of ADAPT-VQE."}

Our framework allows any tomographic data - including archival datasets -- to be reinterpreted in terms of fundamental nonlocality tests. We introduce a generic, constructive method to generate tailored Bell inequalities and showcase their applicability to certify the non-locality of states in realistic experimental scenarios. Recognizing the stabilizer nature of the considered operators, we analyze our inequalities in the context of witnessing quantum magic - a crucial resource for quantum computing. Our approach requires Pauli measurements only and tests the quantum magic solely through the resources present in the state. Our results establish a universal standard that unifies state tomography with nonlocality certification and its application to quantum magic witnessing, thereby streamlining both fundamental studies and practical applications."}

When combined with nonreciprocal hopping, the system exhibits both the non-Hermitian skin effect and a hybrid skin-topological effect, whereby first-order edge states and second-order corner states accumulate at selected corners of the lattice. We demonstrate that the spectral winding number of the edge states under cylindrical geometry dictates this corner localization and can be reversed by tuning the altermagnetic order.

By deriving the exciton Berry curvature in momentum space for a general inhomogeneous 2D system, we establish its dependence on the Berry curvature and the effective mass of electron and hole. As illustrative examples, the exciton Hall effect in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP) are calculated. For these materials, we demonstrate that a linear Hall (Nernst) exciton current with the non-zero Berry curvature is strictly forbidden by the symmetries. This finding aligns with earlier experimental observations on the exciton Hall effect in MoSe$_2$. In contrast, a strong anisotropy in BP leads to a net linear Hall current of excitons, exhibiting a relatively large value and resembling an anomalous Hall effect rather than a valley Hall effect. Our work reveals that the specific symmetry of 2D materials can induce a significant linear exciton Hall (Nernst) effect even without Berry curvature, which is normally forbidden with non-zero Berry curvature in the monolayer 2D material. This observation holds promise for future optoelectronic applications and offers exciting possibilities for experimental exploration."}

As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array.

While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level of higher statistical moments remains a daunting challenge, with analytic progress largely confined to random quantum circuit models or fine-tuned systems exhibiting space-time duality. Here we study how much randomness can be dynamically generated by generic quantum-chaotic evolution under physical, non-random Hamiltonians. Combining theoretical insights with numerical simulations, we show that for broad classes of initially unentangled states, the dynamics become effectively Haar-random well before the system can ergodically explore the physically accessible Hilbert space. Both local and highly nonlocal observables, including entanglement measures, equilibrate to their Haar expectation values and fluctuations on polynomial timescales with remarkably high numerical precision, and with the fastest randomization occurring in regions of parameter space previously identified as maximally chaotic. Interestingly, this effective randomization can occur on timescales linear in system size, suggesting that the sub-ballistic growth of Renyi entropies typically observed in systems with conservation laws can be bypassed in non-random Hamiltonians with an appropriate choice of initial conditions."}
