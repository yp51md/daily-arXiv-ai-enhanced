Progress in this field hinges on achieving stronger and tunable nonlinear effects, which are essential for controlling magnon dynamics and frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrate the magnon Kerr effect in an anisotropic magnonic system comprising a 200~nm-thick yttrium iron garnet film strongly coupled to a three-dimensional microwave resonator. The strong shape anisotropy significantly enhances the magnon Kerr effect compared to a sphere of equivalent volume, while the cavity enables sensitive probing of magnetization dynamics. We demonstrate continuous tunability of the magnitude and sign of the Kerr shift by controlling the static orientation of the magnetization. Input-output modeling of the magnon-photon interaction provides a consistent description of our system and Kerr coefficients matching the experimental results. Our findings demonstrate a scalable approach to enhancing Kerr anharmonicity in hybrid magnon-photon systems while preserving strong coupling."}

In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction. This model provides a microscopic mechanism by which proximity induced spin orbit coupling can be amplified via moire engineering."}

However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $β$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \\lesssim 10\\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape. This could provide a new window into the degeneracy, anisotropy, and competing interactions underlying the Kitaev QSL."}

Here, we experimentally study the entanglement and symmetries of random many-body quantum states generated by evolving simple product states under ergodic Floquet models. We find excellent agreement with the predictions from the Haar-random state ensemble. First, we measure the Rényi-2 entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem size, observing the Page curve.

Here, we report a protocol for deterministically creating SPEs in monolayer WSe2 on SiO2/Si substrates using a sharp diamond AFM (atomic force microscope) tip. A displacement-controlled indentation process is developed, allowing indent depths > 150 nm necessary for creating SPEs. Sharp defect peaks (~200 μeV) are observed in cryogenic (4K) photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at nanoindented sites and are stable upto ~ 120K. 76% of sites exhibit sharp defect-bound peaks confirmed by power-dependent, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL (TRPL). AFM and PL mapping link these peaks to indent periphery. The peaks show sub-linewidth spectral jitter, no blinking, and single-photon nature in second-order autocorrelation measurements. SPEs can be switched on/off, and background emissions suppressed using electrical gating. Gate-voltage dependent TRPL indicate that SPE dynamics can be tuned, depending on nature of SPE, pointing the way to higher-purity SPEs.

Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium. We establish physical criteria distinguishing genuine thermal equilibrium from purely formal temperature assignments and demonstrate that the classical notion of an infinite thermal reservoir emerges as an effective idealization within a hierarchy of dynamically maintained photon baths.

We develop a continuum model for the shrinking dynamics of antiskyrmions in bulk DMI systems, using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the time derivative of the magnetization field. Owing to the structure of their azimuthal angle, or helicity, elliptic antiskyrmions are energetically favored over circular ones. To capture this feature, we parametrize the magnetization field with a triangular radial profile and an elliptic in-plane shape. This ansatz yields four coupled dynamical equations governing time evolution of the semi-axes, helicities, and rotation angles. In the absence of the DMI, circular antiskyrmions shrink isotropically, exhibiting a crossover from exponential decay to square-root collapse. Initially elliptic antiskyrmions are driven towards circularity. For finite DMI, the semi-axes dynamics couples to the helicity and rotation, where the theory predicts a rotation angle following by half of the slope of the helicity evolution which is linear in time. Only at small semi-axes a cross-over to a logarithmic divergence occurs. The shrinking dynamics of the antiskyrmion size is found to be accompanied by quadrupole-like oscillations.

In this study, we investigate the interfacial spin pumping and temperature-dependent spin current exchange in a Cr1.12Te2/Cu/Ni80Fe20 (Py)(FM1/NM/FM2) trilayer structure. Using broadband and cryogenic ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements, we investigate key magnetization dynamical parameters, including the effective Gilbert damping factor, effective magnetic fields, interfacial spin mixing conductance, and spin current density. Efficient spin angular momentum transfers from Py to Cr1.12Te2 are observed at room temperature. At lower temperatures, the enhanced linewidth reflects temperature dependent spin pumping effects occurring at distinct precession frequencies of the ferromagnetic layers. Notably, the absence of interfacial Damping indicates that spin pumping can be modulated by controlling the net spin current flow.

Through a nonunitary gauge transformation, the system is mapped onto a disorder-free lattice, enabling exact analytical solutions for the full spectrum and eigenstates.

In this setup, a quantum point contact bends a single edge into a loop, where tunneling occurs at the open end and is controlled by the QPC voltage. In contrast with previously studied two-edge geometries, the weak backscattering regime is dominated by the first-order perturbative term, allowing quantum transport quantities to factorize into a non-universal prefactor and a braiding-induced contribution that provides direct access to the universal statistical angle $πλ$. While previous analyses neglected edge-to-edge capacitance, we show that capacitive effects, which are known to play a crucial role in mesoscopic capacitors, modify both the current and the current cross-correlations. Using a two-point Green's function formalism augmented by Dyson's equation to include the charging energy, we quantify how the fluctuations of the cross-correlations depend simultaneously on $λ$ and on the capacitance of the loop. Our results indicate that a reliable extraction of the statistical angle requires a parallel measurement of the loop capacitance, which can be implemented via a charged gate coupled to the junction."}

This challenge is particularly severe in calibrating fault-tolerant, error-corrected circuits, where logical error probabilities are suppressed to higher order relative to physical noise and are therefore difficult to calibrate through direct logical measurements. Recently, Wagner et al. [PRL 130, 200601 (2023)] showed that, for phenomenological Pauli noise models, the logical channel can instead be inferred from syndrome measurement data generated during error correction. Here, we extend this framework to realistic circuit-level noise models. From a unified code-theoretic perspective and spacetime code formalism, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the logical channel from syndrome data alone and explicitly characterize the learnable degrees of freedom of circuit-level Pauli faults. Using Fourier analysis and compressed sensing, we develop efficient estimators with provable guarantees on sample complexity and computational cost. We further present an end-to-end protocol and demonstrate its performance on several syndrome-extraction circuits, achieving orders-of-magnitude sample-complexity savings over direct logical benchmarking. Our results establish syndrome-based learning as a practical approach to characterizing the logical channel in fault-tolerant quantum devices."}

In the isotropic case ($Δ=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $Δ$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $Δ$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model."}

Within this framework, the emergence of the t-GGE is fully accounted for by the quasiparticle picture, and we argue that this description remains valid whenever the Lindbladian admits an appropriate coarse-grained representation."}

A new avenue was recently opened in this field by predicting that the Josephson quantum mechanics in the odd parity sector, when a quasiparticle in trapped in an Andreev bound state, is fundamentally different from the conventional one in the even sector. The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment. Here we consider the distinct case of a superconducting qubit made of a single Josephson junction whose environment reduces to a capacitance. We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime.

Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \\textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \\textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes. Our work thus substantially extends the scope of quantum product codes and provides a versatile framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum memories."}

Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium. We establish physical criteria distinguishing genuine thermal equilibrium from purely formal temperature assignments and demonstrate that the classical notion of an infinite thermal reservoir emerges as an effective idealization within a hierarchy of dynamically maintained photon baths.

In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction. This model provides a microscopic mechanism by which proximity induced spin orbit coupling can be amplified via moire engineering."}

While traditional system identification attempts to reconstruct full system matrices (incurring exponential cost in the Hilbert dimension), we propose Quantum Spectral Filtering, a method that shifts the goal to improper dynamic learning. Leveraging the optimal concentration properties of the Slepian basis, we prove that the learnability of such systems is governed strictly by an effective quantum dimension $k^*$, determined by the spectral bandwidth and memory horizon.

Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \\textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \\textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes. Our work thus substantially extends the scope of quantum product codes and provides a versatile framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum memories."}

QEM strategies based on agnostic noise amplification (ANA) are intrinsically resilient to such noise variations, but their sampling cost remains a major practical bottleneck. Here we introduce a mitigation framework that combines virtual noise scaling with a layered mitigation architecture, yielding orders of magnitude reduction in runtime overhead compared to conventional zero-noise extrapolation post-processing. The proposed approach is compatible with dynamic circuits and can be seamlessly integrated with error detection and quantum error correction schemes.

By appropriately tuning the frequency of a pair of lasers, a two-photon transition is continually driven to an atomic excited state that emits photons at the desired wavelength. We show that resonantly coupling a cavity mode to the telecom transition can enhance the rate of emission while retaining the antibunched counting statistics that are characteristic of atomic light sources. We also explore coupling a second, independent cavity mode to the atom, which increases the telecom emission rate and introduces quantum correlations between the cavity modes. A model for the hyperfine structure of a single cesium atom is then described and numerically integrated to demonstrate the viability of implementing the scheme with a modern cavity QED system."}

To survive in a realistic noisy environment, magic states must be prepared fault-tolerantly and protected by a quantum error-correcting code. The recent discovery of highly efficient quantum low-density parity-check codes, together with efficient logic gates, lays the groundwork for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation. This motivates the search for fast and parallel protocols for logical magic state preparation to enable universal quantum computation. Here, we introduce a fast code surgery procedure that performs a fault-tolerant measurement of many transversal logic gates in parallel. This is achieved by performing a generalized gauging measurement on a quantum code that supports a higher-form transversal gate. The time overhead of our procedure is constant, and the qubit overhead is linear. The procedure inherits fault-tolerance properties from the base code and the structure of the higher-form transversal gate. When applied to codes that support higher-form Clifford gates our procedure achieves fast and fault-tolerant preparation of many magic states in parallel. This motivates the search for good quantum low-density parity-check codes that support higher-form Clifford gates."}

However, their memory remains confined to local elements, in contrast to biological or artificial networks where memory is shared across the system. Here, we propose a scalable PQMR network that enables measurement-based memory sharing. Each memristive node updates its internal state using the history of its own and neighbouring quantum states, thereby realizing distributed memory. By modelling each node as a photonic quantum memtransistor, we demonstrate pronounced enhancements in both classical and quantum hysteresis at the device level, as well as enhanced network-level quantum hysteresis. Implemented as a quantum reservoir, the architecture achieves improved Fashion-MNIST classification accuracy and confidence via increased data separability.

These theoretical bounds characterise noise-induced margin decay and are validated via numerical simulations across multiple datasets, as well as experiments on real quantum hardware. We further justify the focus on margin-based measures by empirically establishing margins as a reliable indicator of generalisation performance for QSVMs. Additionally, we motivate the study of local depolarising noise by presenting empirical evidence demonstrating that the commonly used global depolarising noise model is overly optimistic and fails to accurately capture the degradation of generalisation performance observed in the NISQ era."}

A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime.

The underlying optimization problem occurs frequently in physics and beyond, for instance in the computation of the injective tensor norm in multilinear algebra. Here, we introduce a method to determine the maximal overlap of a pure multiparticle quantum state with product states based on considering several copies of the pure state. This leads to three types of hierarchical approximations to the problem, all of which we prove to converge to the actual value. Besides allowing for the computation of the geometric measure of entanglement, our results can be used to tackle optimizations over stochastic local transformations, to find entanglement witnesses for weakly entangled bipartite states, and to design strong separability tests for mixed multiparticle states.

Through a nonunitary gauge transformation, the system is mapped onto a disorder-free lattice, enabling exact analytical solutions for the full spectrum and eigenstates. As a consequence, the inverse participation ratio is strictly energy-independent and controlled solely by a global phase.

In this work, we analytically calculate the 2D Zak phase for a 2D non-Hermitian SSH-type Hamiltonian that supports a rich structure and edge currents. Closed-form expressions for eigenstates and divisions of the phase diagram are obtained, including for regions in the phase diagram where different types of exceptional points exist.
