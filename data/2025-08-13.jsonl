Second, EPSR extends the scope of the\nPSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate\n$U(x) = \\exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs\nare valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words.\nAdditionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by\nWierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it\nyields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the\nweighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter\nshifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates."}

The\nsecond type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the\nlocalized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called\neverywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with\nalmost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.\nAfter illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend\nthe analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE).

Previous studies reveal that the transition between them\ncan be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a\ndirectly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem.\nMotivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct\nanyons in the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We\nconfirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC\nand DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly,\nusing the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the\nWilson loops, we further reveal that $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from\nthe $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition\nbetween $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path\ntoward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions\nbeyond anyon condensation."}

Unlike the case of the standard\nweak-coupling regime, in the USC case, we find distinct relaxation behavior for\ntwo-time correlators depending on the types of the operators involved in the\ncorrelation function. Interestingly, the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT)\nemerges after the fastest relaxation time-scale, which is governed by the\nsystem-bath coupling strength. We exemplify our findings for the dissipative\nspin-boson model and further find excellent agreement with the numerically\nexact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method."}

However, in this work, we demonstrate that SOI can\nbe harnessed to implement an arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit (2Q) gate. We\nconsider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are\nsmoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary\nhigh-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and\nwaiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially,\nperforming 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization\nof a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented\nusing static dots. Our findings establish a practical route toward direct\nimplementation of any 2Q gate via spin shuttling, significantly reducing\ncontrol overhead in scalable quantum computing architectures."}
