The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) - a phenomenon where systems\ninitially farther from equilibrium can thermalize faster - can be understood in\nterms of how rapidly a symmetry, broken by initial conditions, is dynamically\nrestored. In this work, we study the QME in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XYZ\nmodel with power-law decaying interactions in the presence of a magnetic field.\nIn the prethermal regime generated by large field strengths, the system\ndevelops a continuous U(1) symmetry, enabling the QME to emerge. However, due\nto the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the QME can only arise when\ninteractions are sufficiently short-ranged. This leads to an interplay between\nthe external field, interaction range, and dynamical symmetry restoration. We\nsystematically explore this interplay and analyze the dependence of the QME on\nthe effective temperature set by the initial state.

If\none wishes to explain such correlations by classical means, a natural\npossibility is to allow communication between the parties. In particular, LHV\nmodels augmented with two bits of classical communication can explain the\ncorrelations of any two-qubit state. Would this still hold if communication is\nrestricted to measurement outcomes? While in certain scenarios with a finite\nnumber of inputs the answer is yes, we prove that if a model must reproduce all\nprojective measurements, then for any qubit-qudit state the answer is no. In\nfact, a qubit-qudit under projective measurements admits an LHV model with\noutcome communication if and only if it already admits an LHV model without\ncommunication. On the other hand, we also show that when restricted sets of\nmeasurements are considered (for instance, when the qubit measurements are in\nthe upper hemisphere of the Bloch ball), outcome communication does offer an\nadvantage.

In the perfectly\nordered case, where atoms are spaced by exact integer multiples of the\nwavelength, the system exhibits the characteristic superradiant burst with a\npeak emission rate scaling as $N^2$. Using large-scale semiclassical\nsimulations, we find that this key signature of superradiance remains\nasymptotically robust under strong spatial and spectral disorder, but also\nexhibits subtle finite-size scaling toward this limit. To explain our\nobservations, we provide an analytical variational estimate for the maximal\ndecay rate, which tightly bounds the numerical results and reveals how disorder\nshapes the collective decay. Specifically, we find that even in the presence of\nstrong disorder, the spins tend to self-organize spontaneously according to\ntheir locations, which overall optimizes constructive interference effects and\nexplains the emergence of mirror-asymmetric correlations in superradiant decay.\nThese findings resolve important open questions regarding the existence and\nnature of superradiance in strongly disordered arrays and offer valuable\ninsights for understanding collective quantum optical phenomena in realistic\nsystems."}

The encoding\nof correlations across space and time characterises the structure, history, and\ninteractions of systems. One of the most fundamental properties that emerges\nfrom studies of information is the area law, which states that information\nshared between spatial subregions typically scales with the area of their\nboundary rather than their volume. In non-interacting, quantum many-body\nsystems, where Gaussian statistics apply, the scaling of information measures\nis well understood. Within interacting systems, the readout of information\nmeasures is impeded by the complexity of state reconstruction. As such, no\nmeasurements beyond small quantum systems (e.g., composed of few, localised\nparticles) have been made. Here, we fill this gap by experimentally\ndemonstrating the area law of mutual information in an ultra-cold atom\nsimulator of quantum fields with tuneable interaction strength. Our results\ndetail the scaling of mutual information with subsystem volume, boundary area,\nand separation between spatial regions at finite temperature. Moreover, we\nquantify the total effect of non-Gaussian correlations using an\ninformation-theoretic measure - relative entropy.
