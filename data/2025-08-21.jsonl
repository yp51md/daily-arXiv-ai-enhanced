For small twist angles, the density of\nstates as a function of filling and interlayer bias shows qualitatively\ndifferent behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\\circ$) and antialigned\n($60^\\circ$) stacking.

On the other hand, as quantum systems interact with\ntheir surroundings, decoherence emerges, leading to the gradual decay of\nquantum coherence and entanglement. In the case of entanglement, this is known\nas entanglement sudden death (ESD). Decoherence mechanisms are examined,\nfocusing on how various environmental factors, such as thermal,\nelectromagnetic, and collisional decoherence, influence the integrity of\nentangled states. The role of quantum noise, such as amplitude damping, phase\ndamping, and depolarizing, is also analyzed. By integrating theoretical\ninsights with experimental findings, this study highlights the delicate balance\nbetween maintaining entanglement and mitigating decoherence. The findings have\nsignificant implications for the development of quantum technologies, including\nquantum computing and quantum communication, where preserving entanglement is\ncrucial for achieving robust and reliable performance."}

We carefully evaluate the original model in\na coordinate-independent way without requiring a two-dimensional space a\npriori. All scalar field and vector space axioms are traced from model axioms\nand observer choices, including additive and multiplicative units and inverses.\nKnown theorems in math classify allowable amplitude algebras as the real\nassociative composition algebras, namely, the two-dimensional (split-)complex\nnumbers and the four-dimensional (split-)quaternions. Observed probabilities\nare quadratic in amplitudes, akin to the Born rule in physics.

Based on the\nBronstein inequality, here, we use a totally disconnected topological space\n$\\mathcal{X}$ as a model for the space. However, we consider the time as a real\nvariable. In this framework, the formalism of Dirac-von Neumann can be used.\nThis discreteness hypothesis implies that given two different points in space,\nthere is no continuous curve (a world line) joining them. Consequently, this\nhypothesis is not compatible with the theory of relativity. We propose\n$\\mathbb{R}\\times(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathcal{X})^{3}$ as a model of a space-time.\nFor simplicity, we work out our models using\n$\\mathbb{R}\\times(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathcal{X})$ as the configuration space.\nQuantum mechanics (QM), in the sense of Dirac-von Neumann, on the Hilbert space\n$L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathcal{X})$ is a non-local theory: the Hamiltonians\nare non-local operators, and thus, spooky action at a distance is allowed. The\nparadigm asserting that the universe is non-locally real implies that the\nproposed version of QM admits realism. This version of QM can be specialized to\nstandard QM by using Hamiltonians acting on wavefunctions supported on the\nregion $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$. We apply the developed formalism to the\nmeasurement problem. We propose a new mechanism for the collapse of the\nwavefunction. The mechanism resembles the one proposed by Ghirardi, Ramini, and\nWeber, but there are significant differences. The most important feature is\nthat the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation describes the dynamics at all times, even at\nthe moment of measurement.

This can be used in\nquantum networks to perform applications such as blind quantum computing or\nlong-distance quantum key distribution (QKD) with quantum repeaters. Devices to\nperform RSP, referred to as a client, ideally have low hardware requirements,\nsuch as only sending photonic qubits. A weak coherent pulse source offers a\npractical alternative to true single-photon sources and is already widely used\nin QKD. Here, we introduce two new protocols to the previously known protocol\nfor RSP with a weak-coherent-pulse-based device. The known technique uses a\ndouble-click (DC) protocol, where a photon from both the server and the client\nneeds to reach an intermediate Bell state measurement. Here, we add to that a\nsingle-click (SC) RSP protocol, which requires only one photon to reach the\nBell state measurement, allowing for better performance in certain regimes. In\naddition, we introduce a double-single-click (DSC) protocol, where the SC\nprotocol is repeated twice, and a CNOT gate is applied between the resulting\nqubits. DSC mitigates the need for phase stabilization in certain regimes,\nlowering technical complexity while still improving performance compared to DC\nin some regimes. We compare these protocols in terms of fidelity and rate,\nfinding that SC consistently achieves higher rates than DC and, interestingly,\ndoes not suffer from an inherently lower fidelity than the DC, as is the case\nfor entanglement generation. Although SC provides stronger performance, DSC can\nstill show performance improvements over DC, and it may have reduced technical\ncomplexity compared to SC. Lastly, we show how these protocols can be used in\nlong-distance QKD using quantum repeaters."}

A central challenge in\nHamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space\nassociated with gauge degrees of freedom.

We construct\nefficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians\ndirectly in the thermodynamic limit.

This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D\ngauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as\ninfinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a\nbenchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing\nexpected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical\nbehavior at finite mass.
