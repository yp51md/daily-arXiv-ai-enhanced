*Farzan Moosavi,Bilal Farooq*

Main category: quant-ph

Conclusion: 量子计算与强化学习的结合为解决大规模优化问题提供了高效且可扩展的方案。

Abstract: Quantum computation has demonstrated a promising alternative to solving the
NP-hard combinatorial problems. Specifically, when it comes to optimization,
classical approaches become intractable to account for large-scale solutions.
Specifically, we investigate quantum computing to solve the large-scale
Capacitated Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (CPDPTW). In this
regard, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework augmented with a Parametrized
Quantum Circuit (PQC) is designed to minimize the travel time in a realistic
last-mile on-demand delivery. A novel problem-specific encoding quantum circuit
with an entangling and variational layer is proposed. Moreover, Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) are
designed for comparison through numerical experiments, highlighting the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of the scale of the solution and
training complexity while incorporating the real-world constraints.

### [2] [Quantum-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks: Comparative Analysis of Classical and Hybrid Quantum-Classical Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09209)
*Kun Ming Goh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了混合量子-经典GAN（HQCGAN），验证了在噪声量子设备上量子生成器作为潜在先验的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAN的性能受限于潜在表示的质量，而量子电路可能提供更好的潜在向量。

Method: 比较了经典GAN和三种不同量子比特数的HQCGAN，使用Qiskit的AerSimulator模拟噪声量子设备，评估了FID和KID指标。

Result: 经典GAN表现最佳，但7量子比特HQCGAN表现接近，3量子比特模型收敛受限。量子采样开销仅导致训练时间适度增加。

Conclusion: HQCGAN在NISQ时代具有潜力，可作为生成模型的增强手段。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for producing high-fidelity data samples, yet their performance is constrained
by the quality of latent representations, typically sampled from classical
noise distributions. This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs
(HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum
circuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a
classical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using
Qiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum
devices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the
low-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are
trained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and
Kernel Inception Distance (KID). Results show that while the classical GAN
achieved the best scores, the 7-qubit HQCGAN produced competitive performance,
narrowing the gap in later epochs, whereas the 3-qubit model exhibited earlier
convergence limitations. Efficiency analysis indicates only moderate training
time increases despite quantum sampling overhead. These findings validate the
feasibility of noisy quantum circuits as latent priors in GAN architectures,
highlighting their potential to enhance generative modelling within the
constraints of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era.

### [3] [Certifying Quantum States with Uniform Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09259)
*Liang Mao,Yifei Wang,Yingfei Gu,Chengshu Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了均匀测量在量子信息处理中的应用，特别是用于高效认证图态，并提供了实验方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的量子位分辨操作和测量成本高，需要局部寻址和大量经典控制。均匀测量作为一种资源高效的替代方案，能够并行执行，降低成本并提高保真度。

Method: 提出了一种基于均匀测量的认证算法，并设计了基于模拟模式里德堡原子阵列的实验方案。

Result: 证明了均匀测量可以高效认证某些图态，并提供了性能保证的认证算法。

Conclusion: 均匀测量为量子平台上的量子态直接高效表征提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: Qubit-resolved operations and measurements are required for most current
quantum information processing schemes. However, these operations can be
experimentally costly due to the need for local addressing, demanding
significant classical control. A more resource-efficient alternative to extract
information is uniform measurement, where a site-independent rotation of qubits
is performed before measuring in the computational basis. This operation can be
performed in parallel, or globally, in atom- and ion-based platforms, reducing
resource cost and increasing fidelity. In this work, we initiate the
exploration of the utility of this operation in quantum information processing.
In particular, we demonstrate that uniform measurements can certify certain
graph states, a family of highly entangled and broadly useful quantum states.
We provide a sample-efficient certification algorithm with a proved performance
guarantee, together with an experimental scheme based on analog-mode Rydberg
atom arrays. Uniform measurements, therefore, allow direct and efficient
characterization of quantum states on quantum platforms in a hitherto
unexplored manner.

Method: 采用复标度方法（CSM）和精确WKB分析，计算连续谱并推导S矩阵，重新解释Aguilar-Balslev-Combes定理。

Result: 通过修改的希尔伯特空间严格定义了物理态，将散射截面与谱理论联系起来。

Conclusion: 研究为散射理论及相关公式提供了新的见解，深化了对共振现象的理解。

Abstract: Resonance phenomena are central to many quantum systems, where resonant
states are typically described by pole singularities of S-matrix. In this work,
we apply the complex scaling method (CSM) and exact WKB analysis to describe
scattering problems, incorporating both bound and resonant states. We compute
continuum spectrum based on the exact WKB analysis and derive the S-matrix for
the inverted Rosen--Morse potential. We reinterpret the
Aguilar--Balslev--Combes theorem, on which CSM is based; we then discuss the
physical significance of the Siegert boundary condition and rigorously define
physical states in a modified Hilbert space. Our analysis connects the
scattering cross-section and spectral theory, providing insights into the
scattering theory and related formulas.

### [5] [Displaced Janus States: Tunable Non-Gaussianity and Exact Higher-Order Coherences for Quantum Advantage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09234)

Result: 揭示了量子干涉如何调控非高斯性，并识别了产生Wigner负性和海森堡极限计量精度的参数区域。

Conclusion: 位移Janus态为非高斯态工程提供了基础工具，是混合量子协议和容错连续变量计算的关键资源。

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states are essential for achieving a quantum advantage in
continuous-variable (CV) information processing. Among these, superpositions of
squeezed states offer a rich phenomenology, yet a complete analytical
understanding of their higher-order quantum statistics-such as the transition
from extreme bunching ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to suppression ($g^{(k>2)} \to
0$)-has remained elusive. In this work, we introduce and provide an exact
solution for the displaced Janus state-a coherent superposition of two squeezed
coherent states. We develop a powerful analytical framework built upon a new
family of Generalized Squeezing Polynomials that yields closed-form expressions
for its arbitrary-order coherence functions, Wigner function, and quantum
Fisher information. This enables a full characterization of the state's tunable
non-Gaussianity, revealing how quantum interference can transform the extreme
photon bunching of its components into strong antibunching or perfect
multiphoton suppression. We identify parameter regimes that generate Wigner
negativity and can be harnessed for achieving Heisenberg-limited metrological
precision. Our work provides a foundational toolkit for engineering
non-Gaussian states, establishing the displaced Janus state as a key resource
for hybrid quantum protocols and fault-tolerant CV computation.

### [6] [A Symmetry-Based Taxonomy of Quantum Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09236)

Conclusion: 对称性为中心的量子算法分类法具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: We propose a taxonomy for quantum algorithms grounded in the fundamental
symmetries, both continuous and discrete, underlying quantum state spaces,
oracles, and circuit dynamics. By organizing algorithms according to their
symmetry groups and invariants, we define distinct algorithm classes whose
behavior, verification, and complexity can be characterized by the symmetries
they preserve or exploit. This symmetry-centric classification not only
reflects the deep connection between symmetries and conservation laws in
physics, but also yields practical benefits for scalable and reliable quantum
computation.

### [7] [Scalable Fluxonium-Transmon Architecture for Error Corrected Quantum Processors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09267)
*Lukas Heunisch,Longxiang Huang,Stephan Tasler,Johannes Schirk,Florian Wallner,Verena Feulner,Bijita Sarma,Klaus Liegener,Christian M. F. Schneider,Stefan Filipp,Michael J. Hartmann*

Main category: quant-ph

Result: 数值模拟显示，CZ门的闭合系统保真度远低于相干极限，且在旁观量子位存在时仍保持高保真度。

Conclusion: 该架构为大规模量子计算提供了可扩展的解决方案，尤其适用于纠错编码。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum computing architecture composed of alternating
fluxonium and transmon qubits, that are coupled via transmon tunable couplers.
We show that this system offers excellent scaling properties, characterized by
engineered zero $ZZ$-crosstalk in the idle regime, a substantial reduction of
level-crowding challenges through the alternating arrangement of different
qubit types within the lattice, and parameter regimes that circumvent the
capacitive loading problem commonly associated with fluxoniums. In numerical
simulations, we show a parametrically driven CZ-gate that achieves a
closed-system infidelity that is orders of magnitude below the coherence limit
for gate durations $\gtrsim 30\,\rm{ns}$ using a two-tone flux pulse on the
tunable coupler. Furthermore, we show that this gate scheme retains its
fidelity in the presence of spectator qubits, making it a scalable solution for
large lattices. Moreover, for the implementation of error correcting codes, our
approach can leverage the long coherence times and large non-linearities of
fluxoniums as data qubits, while fixed-frequency transmons with established
readout techniques can serve as measurement ancillas.

### [8] [Secure authentication via Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions: a review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09296)

Method: 采用共引选择方法追踪QPUF架构的演变，从QR-PUFs到HPUFs，并分析信息论分析的作用。

Result: 尽管有显著进展，实现实用且稳健的QPUF认证仍是一个开放挑战。

Conclusion: QPUF认证的实用化仍需进一步研究，尤其是在解决量子存储和随机性等关键挑战方面。

Abstract: Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs) offer a physically grounded
approach to secure authentication, extending the capabilities of classical
PUFs. This review covers their theoretical foundations and key implementation
challenges - such as quantum memories and Haar-randomness -, and distinguishes
QPUFs from Quantum Readout PUFs (QR-PUFs), more experimentally accessible yet
less robust against quantum-capable adversaries. A co-citation-based selection
method is employed to trace the evolution of QPUF architectures, from early
QR-PUFs to more recent Hybrid PUFs (HPUFs). This method further supports a
discussion on the role of information-theoretic analysis in mitigating
inconsistencies in QPUF responses, underscoring the deep connection between
secret-key generation and authentication. Despite notable advances, achieving
practical and robust QPUF-based authentication remains an open challenge.

### [9] [Oscillating bound states in waveguide-QED system with two giant atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09338)
*F. J. Lü,W. Z. Jia*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了两个相同的两能级巨原子与一维波导耦合系统中的连续谱束缚态（BIC），分析了耦合构型和原子参数对衰减抑制的影响，并对束缚态进行了详细分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索连续谱束缚态在波导量子电动力学中的行为及其在量子技术中的应用潜力。

Result: 系统支持静态束缚态和振荡束缚态，后者在特定条件下可包含更多谐波成分，适用于高容量量子信息处理。

Conclusion: 研究增进了对多巨原子波导量子电动力学中BIC的理解，并揭示了其在量子技术中的潜在应用。

Abstract: We study the bound states in the continuum (BIC) in a system of two identical
two-level giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. By deriving
general dark-state conditions, we clarify how coupling configurations and
atomic parameters influence decay suppression. Through analysis of the
long-time dynamical behaviors of atoms and bound photons, we carry out a
detailed classification of bound states and explore the connections between
these dynamical behaviors and the system's intrinsic light-matter interactions.
The system supports static bound states with persistent atomic excitations, and
oscillating bound states with periodic atom-photon or atom-atom excitation
exchange. Under certain conditions, oscillating bound states can contain more
harmonic components owing to the emergence of additional quasi-dark modes,
rendering them promising platforms for high-capacity quantum information
processing. These findings advance the understanding of BIC in waveguide
quantum electrodynamics with multiple giant atoms and reveal their prospective
applications in quantum technologies.

Result: 解析表达式与全量子计算结果吻合良好，尤其在离子-原子碰撞的共振电荷转移中表现显著。

Conclusion: 相位锁定是共振交换散射的核心机制，解析表达式为高能行为提供了有效描述。

Abstract: Resonant-exchange scattering plays a key role in many-body dynamics and
transport phenomena (such as spin, charge, or excitation diffusion) at low and
moderate temperatures. Recent investigations have shown that the locking of
phase shifts is central to resonant-exchange scattering at low energies.
Moreover, phase-shift locking causes an unexpected behavior, namely the
resonant-exchange cross section over a broad range of energies is largely
dictated by $s$-wave scattering, whose influence extends high above the
$s$-wave Wigner regime. Here, we generalize our previous treatment to higher
energies and derive an analytical expression for the resonant-exchange cross
section which depends on a few parameters and accounts not only for the locking
of phase shifts, but also for their gradual unlocking with increased energy. We
find good agreement between the computed (fully quantal) cross sections and
those obtained with our expression, which we illustrate in great detail for the
case of resonant charge-transfer in ion-atom collisions.

Conclusion: Bures距离可作为区分混沌与可积系统的有效指标，其标度行为源于可积系统中局部守恒量的不连续性。

Abstract: The average subsystem trace distance has been proposed as an indicator of
quantum many-body chaos and integrability. In integrable systems, evaluating
the trace distance faces two challenges: the computational cost for large
systems and ambiguities in defining and ordering eigenstates. In this paper, we
calculate the average subsystem Bures distance in the spin-1/2 transverse-field
Ising chain. We develop an efficient algorithm to evaluate the Bures distance
between two Gaussian states, which allows us to access larger system sizes. To
address the degeneracy issue, we consider simultaneous eigenstates of all local
conserved charges and use these charges to systematically order degenerate
states. The results align with the conjectured linear increase with subsystem
size. We demonstrate that the distinct scaling behaviors of the average
subsystem trace and Bures distances in chaotic versus integrable systems stem
from discontinuities of local conserved charges across the spectrum in
integrable systems. Additionally, we investigate the average subsystem
distances between random pure Gaussian states but do not observe a linear
increase.

Abstract: Aquantummemoryforlightisexpectedtoplayacrucialroleinquantumcommunicationprotocols
and distributed quantum computing. In addition to storage and buffering, a
quantum memory can be used for manipulations of stored states to allow more
complex quantum network operations. In this work, we demonstrate an in-memory
Fourier transform using a combination of two well-established quantum memory
protocols: Gradient Echo Memory and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency.
Our experiment is realised using an ensemble of rubidium atoms that are laser
cooled in an elongated magneto-optic trap to maximise optical depth. The
results of our time-frequency Fourier transform can be understood as a temporal
double slit. We show that the interference between time-separated pulses
depends on the relative phase and time between the pulses of light. The use of
a quantum memory enables us to illuminate exactly where and how interference
occurs between time separated pulses. Time-frequency Fourier manipulation is a
well established technique in classical optical systems. Our combination of
Fourier manipulation and quantum-compatible memory could be used to bring
similar capability to quantum optical systems.

Result: 非马尔可夫动力学能广泛稳定BTCs，且表现出复杂的参数依赖性。

Conclusion: 研究为耗散系统中稳定时间晶体提供了新途径，并可能推动时间平移对称性破缺的研究。

Abstract: We study Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in the presence of non-Markovian
dynamics. In contrast to BTCs observed in earlier works in the Markovian
regime, we show that non-Markovian dynamics can be highly beneficial for
stabilizing BTCs over a wide range of parameter values, even in the presence of
intermediate rates of dissipation. We analyze the effect of non-Markovian
dynamics on BTCs using quantum Fisher information, order parameter, a measure
of non-Markovianity, and a dynamical phase diagram, all of which show complex
behaviours with changing non-Markovianity parameters. Our studies can pave the
way for stabilizing time crystals in dissipative systems, as well as lead to
studies on varied dissipative dynamics on time translational symmetry breaking.

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计高效传输系统提供了指导，适用于电子、光伏和量子通信领域。

Abstract: Carrier transport in quantum networks is governed by a variety of factors,
including network dimensionality and connectivity, on-site energies, couplings
between sites and whether they are short- or long-range, and environmental
effects. In this work, we identify classes of quasi-one-dimensional chains with
energy profiles that optimize carrier transport under such influences.
Specifically, we optimize on-site energies using Optax's optimistic gradient
descent and AdaMax algorithms, enabled by the JAX automatic differentiation
framework. Focusing on steady-state transport, we study the system's behavior
under combined unitary and nonunitary (dephasing and dissipative) effects using
the Lindblad quantum master equation. After validating our optimization scheme
on short chains, we extend the study to larger systems where we identify
systematic patterns in energy profiles. Our analysis reveals that different
types of energy landscape enhance transport, depending on whether inter-site
tunneling couplings in the chain are short- or long-range, the existence of
environmental interactions, and the temperature of the environment. Our
classification and insights of optimal energy landscapes offer guidance for
designing efficient transport systems for electronic, photovoltaic and quantum
communication applications.

Abstract: We demonstrate that parallel repetition of the multiplayer anchored optimal
value, $\omega \big( G_{\bot} \big)^{\otimes n}$, decays exponentially. Central
to our approach are several probabilistic computations, pertaining to: (1) the
computation of expected values for quantifying how the winning probability of
the game is likely to change under the anchoring transformation; (2) the
computation of positive operator valued measurements, which can be placed into
direct correspondence with several probabilistically defined quantities; (3)
the computation of Relative, and Relative-min entropies; (4) and lastly, the
computation of generalized error bounds, which have previously been analyzed by
the author in several multiplayer game-theoretic settings (arXiv: 2505.06322,
and arXiv: 2507.03035). This work builds upon observations originally provided
by Bavarian, Vidick, and Yuen (arXiv: 1509.07466).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型连续变量量子秘密共享协议（SDD-CVQSS），通过状态判别检测器（SDD）替代传统相干检测器，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续变量量子秘密共享（CVQSS）性能有限，需要改进以实现更高的安全性和效率。

Method: 开发了SDD-CVQSS协议，设计了专用的SDD以高效区分混合态，并建立了安全模型对抗光束分裂集体攻击。

Conclusion: SDD-CVQSS通过后选择方案补偿长距离传输性能下降，为高性能CVQSS提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum secret sharing (CVQSS) is a promising approach to
ensuring multi-party information security. While CVQSS offers practical ease of
implementation, its present performance remains limited. In this paper, we
propose a novel CVQSS protocol integrated with a state-discrimination detector
(SDD), dubbed SDD-CVQSS. In particular, we first develop the detailed procedure
of SDD-CVQSS, which replaces the traditional coherent detector with an SDD and
eliminates the long-standing necessary step of establishing multiple
point-to-point quantum key distribution links between all users and the dealer.
We then elaborate on the principle of the specifically designed SDD, which can
efficiently discriminate mixed states with a much lower error probability.
Finally, we construct a security model for SDD-CVQSS and derive its security
bound against beam-splitting collective attacks. Numerical simulations show
that SDD-CVQSS outperforms conventional CVQSS in both maximum transmission
distance and secret key rate, even surpassing the PLOB bound. Additionally, we
find that the performance degradation of SDD-CVQSS in long-distance
transmission scenarios can be effectively compensated for using a
post-selection scheme, providing a feasible way to achieve high-performance
CVQSS.

Abstract: Parrondo's paradox describes a counterintuitive phenomenon where alternating
between two individually losing games results in a winning expectation. While
its classical origin relies on capital-dependent bias and noise-induced
asymmetry, realizing a robust quantum version of the paradox has remained
challenging, especially under the constraint of single-qubit coin systems. In
this work, we demonstrate that a genuine quantum Parrondo effect can emerge in
discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) by alternating two SU(2) coin operators and
introducing a localized phase shift at the origin. Through a series of
numerical experiments, we show that this minimal model, without entanglement or
high-dimensional coins, exhibits sustained positive drift only in the presence
of spatial inhomogeneity. We analyze the role of phase angle, coin parameters,
and game sequences, and identify optimal regions in which constructive
interference enables paradoxical transport. Our findings validate recent
theoretical claims that translational symmetry breaking is essential for
overcoming interference-induced cancellation, thereby enabling directed quantum
motion. This work opens new possibilities for realizing counterintuitive
quantum dynamics using low-resource architectures, with potential applications
in quantum control, energy harvesting, and coherence-assisted transport.

Abstract: In dissipative bosonic systems, dephasing is typically expected to accelerate
relaxation and suppress coherent dynamics. However, we show that in networks of
coherently coupled bosonic modes with non-uniform local dissipation, the
presence of quasi-dark states leads to a nontrivial response to dephasing:
while weak dephasing facilitates equilibration, moderate to strong dephasing
induces a pronounced slowdown of relaxation, revealing the existence of an
optimal dephasing rate that enhances equilibration. Using exact dynamical
equations for second-order moments, we demonstrate that dephasing suppresses
coherent transport and gives rise to long-lived collective modes that dominate
the system's late-time behavior. This phenomenon bears striking similarities to
Lifshitz-tail states, which are known in disordered systems to cause
anomalously slow relaxation. Our results uncover a counterintuitive mechanism
by which dephasing, rather than promoting equilibration, can dynamically
decouple specific modes from dissipation, thereby protecting excitations. These
findings highlight how non-Hermitian physics in open bosonic systems can give
rise to unexpected dynamical regimes, paving the way for new strategies to
control relaxation and decoherence in bosonic quantum systems, with broad
implications for both experimental and theoretical quantum science.

Result: 实验证实相对WFEs存在，且湍流对长距离链路（如地面-卫星）的影响更显著。

Conclusion: 传统CV-QKD假设需重新审视，长距离链路的性能可能受WFEs限制更严重。

Abstract: When undertaking continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) across
atmospheric channels, strong classical local oscillators (LOs) are often
polarization-multiplexed with the weak quantum signals for coherent measurement
at the receiver. Although the wavefronts of the quantum signal and LO are often
assumed to experience the same distortion across channels, previous theoretical
work has shown that they can experience differential distortions, resulting in
relative wavefront errors (WFEs). Such errors have previously been shown to
limit CV-QKD performance, in some cases leading to zero secure key rates. In
this work, for the first time, we provide strong experimental evidence that
relative WFEs are present in some circumstances and that standard assumptions
in CV-QKD deployments may need to be revisited. In addition, we demonstrate how
turbulence can affect the detailed form of the relative WFEs, thereby
indicating that long-range links like terrestrial-satellite channels are likely
impacted more than short-range terrestrial-only channels.

Abstract: Quantum reference frame transformations have been proposed to provide a means
by which to translate descriptions of quantum systems relative to each other.
At present, there are several differing frameworks for describing quantum
reference frames, with concomitantly different transformation rules. Here, we
investigate a simple example of three qubit systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry in order to analyze physical and conceptual distinctions between three
contemporary approaches to quantum reference frames -- dubbed
perspective-neutral, extra particle and operational. By constructing two
three-qubit states that are indistinguishable by observables relative to one
frame but are distinguishable by observables relative to another, we show that
each of the three approaches provides a distinct transformation rule, which may
be understood to reflect differing attitudes towards the global state and the
information that can be accessed by each frame. This helps us to shed light on
the operational meaning of each approach and the contexts in which they may be
most naturally applied.

Abstract: Universal quantum computers promise to solve computational problems that are
beyond the capabilities of known classical algorithms. To realize such quantum
hardware on a superconducting material platform, a vast number of physical
qubits has to be manufactured and integrated at high quality and uniformity on
a chip. Anticipating the benefits of semiconductor industry processes in terms
of process control, uniformity and repeatability, we set out to manufacture
superconducting quantum circuits in a semiconductor fabrication facility. In
order to set a baseline for the process quality, we report on the fabrication
of coplanar waveguide resonators in a 200 mm production line, making use of a
two-layer superconducting circuit technology. We demonstrate high material and
process quality by cryogenic Q-factor measurements exceeding $10^6$ in the
single-photon regime, for microwave resonators made of both Niobium and
Tantalum. In addition, we demonstrate the incorporation of superconducting
Niobium air bridges in our process, while maintaining the high quality factor

used in practice for game development and deployment. In this work we identify
procedural content generation as a very promising area of application and
exploration. We examine a selection of algorithmic approaches used in classical
procedural content generation and propose promising quantum algorithms that
could provide an alternative approach or a computational advantage. We then end
with a hypothetical game that exploits a recent quantum algorithm for computing

Abstract: Ground-state cooling is essential for accessing the quantum regime and
enabling quantum control of macroscopic systems. However, achieving
optomechanical cooling in the unresolved-sideband regime ($\omega_b < \kappa$)
remains challenging. In this Letter, we propose an efficient cooling strategy
based on a hybrid optomechanical system incorporating a yttrium iron garnet
(YIG) sphere embedded in an optomechanical cavity. Under strong cavity driving,
the Kerr nonlinearity of the magnons hosted in the YIG sphere gives rise to a
two-magnon process. Adiabatic elimination of the magnons yields an effective
two-photon process in the cavity, which destructively interferes with all
dissipative channels, surpassing the quantum backaction limit and enabling
\textit{complete suppression} of heating under optimal conditions, even in the
deeply unresolved sideband regime (DUSR: $\omega_b \ll \kappa$). Moreover,
injecting squeezed vacuum noise into the cavity not only preserves these
advantages but also delivers additional enhancements, including higher net
cooling rates, reduced optomechanical coupling requirements, and improved noise
robustness. Comparative analysis shows that our approach outperforms existing
schemes without Kerr magnons, underscoring the potential of integrating
nonlinear magnonics with optomechanics for quantum control of macroscopic
mechanical systems.

Conclusion: 提出的方法简化了纠缠认证，适用于部分态信息的情况。

Abstract: Entanglement certification is crucial in physical experiments, particularly
when only partial knowledge of the quantum state is available. In this context,
we present an entanglement criterion based on positive but not completely
positive maps, which eliminates the need to identify eigenvalues of the output
state. Notably, the Faddeev-LeVerrier algorithm establishes a relationship
between the coefficients of characteristic polynomials and the moments of a
matrix. This enables the existence of negative eigenvalues through the moments
of the output state. The effectiveness of our criterion relies on the selection
of positive maps, similar to the original positive maps criterion.

Abstract: We investigate the capabilities of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks
(QGANs) in image generations tasks. Our analysis centers on fully quantum
implementations of both the generator and discriminator. Through extensive
numerical testing of current main architectures, we find that QGANs struggle to
generalize across datasets, converging on merely the average representation of
the training data. When the output of the generator is a pure-state, we
analytically derive a lower bound for the discriminator quality given by the
fidelity between the pure-state output of the generator and the target data
distribution, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the limitations
observed in current models. Our findings reveal fundamental challenges in the
generalization capabilities of existing quantum generative models. While our
analysis focuses on QGANs, the results carry broader implications for the
performance of related quantum generative models.

Conclusion: 对称性视角不仅简化并统一了已知结果，还为量子干扰和传感的新发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer is a foundational tool in quantum optics,
with both fundamental and practical significance. Earlier works identified that
input-state symmetry under exchange of the two spatial modes is fundamental in
the understanding of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. We now show that this notion of
symmetry is central to generalizing this effect. In particular, this point of
view enables the construction of extensions beyond the standard two
single-photon case to arbitrary input states, as well as to configurations with
more than two spatial modes via a natural generalization of the beam splitter
to a discrete Fourier transform interferometer. Beyond its conceptual
significance, this framework offers direct insights into quantum metrology,
showing how symmetry properties of input states allow the computation of
explicit precision bounds. By focusing on symmetry, we provide a perspective
that simplifies and unifies a range of known results, while paving the way for
new developments in quantum interference and sensing.

Abstract: Generative learning models in medical research are crucial in developing
training data for deep learning models and advancing diagnostic tools, but the
problem of high-quality, diverse images is an open topic of research.
Quantum-enhanced generative models have been proposed and tested in the
literature but have been restricted to small problems below the scale of
industry relevance. In this paper, we propose quantum-enhanced diffusion and
variational autoencoder (VAE) models and test them on the fundus retinal image
generation task. In our numerical experiments, the images generated using
quantum-enhanced models are of higher quality, with 86% classified as gradable
by external validation compared to 69% with the classical model, and they match
more closely in features to the real image distribution compared to the ones
generated using classical diffusion models, even when the classical diffusion
models are larger than the quantum model. Additionally, we perform noisy
testing to confirm the numerical experiments, finding that quantum-enhanced
diffusion model can sometimes produce higher quality images, both in terms of
diversity and fidelity, when tested with quantum hardware noise. Our results
indicate that quantum diffusion models on current quantum hardware are strong
targets for further research on quantum utility in generative modeling for
industrially relevant problems.

Conclusion: 该PIC平台为大规模光学控制提供了可扩展的解决方案，适用于容错量子计算机和其他精密技术。

Abstract: High-fidelity control of the thousands to millions of programmable qubits
needed for utility-scale quantum computers presents a formidable challenge for
control systems. In leading atomic systems, control is optical: UV-NIR beams
must be fanned out over numerous spatial channels and modulated to implement
gates. While photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer a potentially scalable
solution, they also need to simultaneously feature high-speed and
high-extinction modulation, strong inter-channel isolation, and broad
wavelength compatibility. Here, we introduce and experimentally validate a
foundry-fabricated PIC platform that overcomes these limitations. Designed for
Rubidium-87 neutral atom quantum computers, our 8-channel PICs, fabricated on a
200-mm wafer process, demonstrate an advanced combination of performance
metrics. At the 795 nm single-qubit gate wavelength, we achieve a mean
extinction ratio (ER) of 71.4 $\pm$ 1.1 dB, nearest-neighbor on-chip crosstalk
of -68.0 $\pm$ 1.0 dB, and -50.8 $\pm$ 0.2 dB after parallel beam delivery in
free-space. This high-performance operation extends to the 420 nm and 1013 nm
wavelengths for two-qubit Rydberg gates, showing ERs of 42.4 dB
(detector-limited) and 61.5 dB, respectively. The devices exhibit 10-90% rise
times of 26 $\pm$ 7 ns, achieve dynamic switching to -60 dB levels within
microsecond timescales, and show pulse stability errors at the $10^{-3}$ level.
This work establishes a scalable platform for developing advanced large-scale
optical control required in fault-tolerant quantum computers and other
precision technologies.

Abstract: Majorana-based quantum computation in nanowires and neutral atoms has gained
prominence as a promising platform to encode qubits and protect them against
noise. In order to run computations reliably on such devices, a fully
fault-tolerant scheme is needed for state preparation, gates, and measurements.
However, current fault-tolerant schemes have either been limited to specific
code families or have not been developed fully. In this work, we develop a
general framework for fault-tolerant computation with logical degrees encoded
into Majorana hardware. We emphasize the division between even and odd Majorana
codes and how it manifests when constructing fault tolerant gadgets for these
families. We provide transversal constructions and supplement them with
measurements to obtain several examples of fault tolerant Clifford gadgets. For
the case of odd codes, we give a novel construction for gadgets using quantum
reference frames, that allows to implement operations that are forbidden due to
parity superselection. We also provide a fault-tolerant measurement scheme for
Majorana codes inspired by Steane error correction, enabling state preparation,
measurement of logical operations and error correction. We also point out a
construction for odd Majorana codes with transversal T gates. Finally, we
construct an asympotically good quantum LDPC Majorana code with qubit degrees
of freedom. Our work shows that all necessary elements of fault-tolerant
quantum computation can be consistently implemented in fermionic hardware such
as Majorana nanowires and fermionic neutral atoms.

Conclusion: 研究深化了对量子重现的理论理解，揭示了其与量子混沌的关系，并指出了量子计量和控制的特殊参数区域。

Abstract: The Poincar\'e recurrence theorem shows that conservative systems in a
bounded region of phase space eventually return arbitrarily close to their
initial state after a finite amount of time. An analogous behavior occurs in
certain quantum systems where quantum states can recur after sufficiently long
unitary evolution, a phenomenon known as quantum recurrence. Periodically
driven (i.e. Floquet) quantum systems in particular exhibit complex dynamics
even in small dimensions, motivating the study of how interactions and
Hamiltonian structure affect recurrence behavior. While most existing studies
treat recurrence in an approximate, distance-based sense, here we address the
problem of exact, state-independent recurrences in a broad class of
finite-dimensional Floquet systems, spanning both integrable and non-integrable
models. Leveraging techniques from algebraic field theory, we construct an
arithmetic framework that identifies all possible recurrence times by analyzing
the cyclotomic structure of the Floquet unitary's spectrum. This
computationally efficient approach yields both positive results, enumerating
all candidate recurrence times and definitive negative results, rigorously
ruling out exact recurrences for given Hamiltonian parameters. We further prove
that rational Hamiltonian parameters do not, in general, guarantee exact
recurrence, revealing a subtle interplay between system parameters and
long-time dynamics. Our findings sharpen the theoretical understanding of
quantum recurrences, clarify their relationship to quantum chaos, and highlight
parameter regimes of special interest for quantum metrology and control.

Abstract: We study the quantum statistics of single-mode radiation emitted by an atomic
ensemble when the ensemble is initially prepared in a superradiant Dicke state.
We show that while the radiation is well approximated by the Glauber coherent
state at early times in the evolution, the emission can be truly quantum at
later times. In particular, one can observe a large amount of photon-number
squeezing in the emission under certain conditions; even a Fock state can be
produced. We discuss the quantum statistics of the emission for various
parameters, including different initial conditions for the atomic ensemble. To
obtain these results, we have developed a formalism where we are able to
calculate the quantum statistics of the emission over long time-scales even
when the number of atoms in the ensemble is quite large.

Abstract: In this work we improve the quantum communication rates of various quantum
channels of interest using permutation-invariant quantum codes. We focus in
particular on parametrized families of quantum channels and aim to improve
bounds on their quantum capacity threshold, defined as the lowest noise level
at which the quantum capacity of the channel family vanishes. These thresholds
are important quantities as they mark the noise level up to which faithful
quantum communication is theoretically possible. Our method exploits the fact
that independent and identically distributed quantum channels preserve any
permutation symmetry present at the input. The resulting symmetric output
states can be described succinctly using the representation theory of the
symmetric and general linear groups, which we use to derive an efficient
algorithm for computing the channel coherent information of a
permutation-invariant code. Our approach allows us to evaluate coherent
information values for a large number of channel copies, e.g., at least 100
channel copies for qubit channels. We apply this method to various physically
relevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure
channel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing
channel. For each channel family we obtain improved lower bounds on their
quantum capacities. For example, for the 2-Pauli and BB84 channel families we
significantly improve the best known quantum capacity thresholds derived in
[Fern, Whaley 2008]. These threshold improvements are achieved using a
repetition code-like input state with non-orthogonal code states, which we
further analyze in our representation-theoretic framework.

Abstract: We investigate the role of relaxation mechanisms in the driven response of
elastic disordered interfaces in finite dimensions, focusing on the interplay
between dimensionality and interaction range. Through extensive numerical
simulations, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes. In two-dimensional
systems with long-range interactions, we observe a regime of coexistence
between pinned and flowing states. In contrast, for one-dimensional interfaces
with long-range elasticity, as well as for short-range interactions in both 1D
and 2D, the coexistence regime is absent. Nevertheless, the avalanche
statistics differ significantly from those of overdamped systems: the usual
power-law distribution is replaced by a pronounced bump, associated with large,
anomalous avalanches that expand ballistically. We interpret these events as
failed synchronization attempts and suggest they could be detected in
experimental systems.

Abstract: We study sign structures of the ground states of spin-$1/2$ magnetic systems
using the methods of Boolean Fourier analysis. Previously it was shown that the
sign structures of frustrated systems are of complex nature: specifically,
neural networks of popular architectures lack the generalization ability
necessary to effectively reconstruct sign structures in supervised learning
settings. This is believed to be an obstacle for applications of neural quantum
states to frustrated systems. In the present work, we develop an alternative
language for the analysis of sign structures based on representing them as
polynomial functions defined on the Boolean hypercube - an approach called
Boolean Fourier analysis. We discuss the relations between the properties of
the Boolean Fourier series and the learning complexity of sign structures, and
demonstrate that such polynomials can potentially serve as variational
ans\"atze for the complex sign structures that dramatically outperform neural
networks in terms of generalization ability. While ans\"atze of this type
cannot yet be directly used in the context of variational optimization, they
indicate that the complexity of sign structures is not an insurmountable curse,
and can potentially be learned with better designed NQS architectures. Finally,
we show how augmenting data with Boolean functions can aid sign prediction by
neural networks.

Abstract: We study the dynamic behavior of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with
dipolar interactions when the influence of external electric fields affects the
coherent tunneling properties. Here, we propose a tunable platform based on
BECs where Josephson oscillations can be engineered and modulated through
external electric fields. We develop a theoretical and numerical frame-work
that reveals how electric fields affect intercondensate tunneling, phase
dynamics, and collective excitations. By employing a coupled set of
Gross-Pitaevskii equations with adiabatic elimination of excited states, we
demonstrate field-induced tuning of Josephson frequencies and a transition from
contact to dipole-dominated regimes. These findings corroborate theoretical
predictions about the sensitivity of dipolar BECs to external fields and deepen
our understanding of quantum coherence and tunneling in long-range interacting
quantum systems.

Abstract: Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we
demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in
these lattices through \textit{superoscillations}. This generic wave phenomenon
occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the
frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how
sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a
one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless
Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the
relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it
is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain
multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes
superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in
blue-detuned optical lattices.

Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres which can
undergo collisions converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. As the two
species represent birds and air, this reactive collision mimics birds flapping
their wings, allowing for their propulsion. We demand microscopic reversibility
of the reactive collisions. We then introduce a chemostat to drive the system
out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one
restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can
turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition.

Abstract: Using the framework of generalized exclusion processes we study mixtures of
passive and active particles interacting by steric repulsion. The particles
move in a pore with periodically modulated aperture, which is modeled by a
quasi-one-dimensional channel with periodic tooth-shaped profile. Internal
driving of the active particles induces a ratchet current of these particles.
In the current-density diagram, we observe three main regimes: of free flow; of
thermally activated processes; of spinodal decomposition. When the density of
particles is increased, we observe a transition to jammed state, where the
ratchet current is substantially reduced. In time evolution, the transition to
jammed state is seen as sudden drop of current at certain time. The probability
distribution of these jamming times follows an exponential law. The average
jamming time depends itself exponentially on the density of active particles.
The coefficient in this exponential is nearly independent of the switching rate
of the active particles as well as on the presence or absence of passive
particles. Due to the interaction, the current of active particles imposes a
drag on the passive particles. In the limit of both large systems and long
times, the current of passive particles has always the same direction as the
ratchet current of active particles. However, during the evolution of the
system we observe very slow (logarithmic in time) approach to the asymptotic
value, sometimes accompanied by current reversal, i.e. current of active and
passive particles may go in opposite direction.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了驱动密集胶体混合物中粒子行为的普遍规律，为粒子分离提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The system of driven dense colloid mixtures is studied in one-, two- and
three-dimensional geometries. We calculate the diffusion coefficients and
mobilities for each particle type, including cross-terms, in a hydrodynamic
limit, using a mean-field-type approximation. The set of non-linear diffusion
equations are then solved. In one dimension, analytical results are possible.
We show that in mixtures, the ``Brazil nut'' phenomenon, or depletion of larger
particles by force of smaller ones, appears quite generically. We calculate the
ratchet current and quantify the capability of sorting particles according to
their size. We also indicate that the ``Brazil nut'' effect lies behind the
possibility of perfect separation, where large and big particles travel in
strictly opposite direction.

Motivation: 研究管状系统中密集胶体混合物的动力学行为，特别是粒子间的相关性，以扩展ASEP模型的应用范围。

Method: 通过放松ASEP模型的排他约束并引入两种粒子，使用Kirkwood近似计算相关性，并与数值模拟结果对比。

Result: Kirkwood近似对近邻相关性准确，但对长程相关性失效；单组分系统相关性幂律衰减（指数≈2），双组分系统行为更复杂。

Conclusion: 扩展的ASEP模型属于不同于可映射为零范围过程的ASEP模型的新普适性类别。

Abstract: The system of driven dense colloid mixture in a tube with diameter comparable
with particle size is modeled by a generalization of asymmetric simple
exclusion (ASEP) model. The generalization goes in two directions: relaxing the
exclusion constraint by allowing several (but few) particles on a site, and by
considering two species of particles, which differ by size and transport
coefficients. We calculate the nearest-neighbor correlations using a variant of
Kirkwood approximation and show by comparison with numerical simulations that
the approximation provides quite accurate results. However, for long-range
correlations, we show that the Kirkwood approximation is useless, as it
predicts exponential decay of the density-density correlation function with
distance, while simulation data indicate that the decay is algebraic. For
one-component system, we show that the decay is governed by a power law with
universal exponent close to 2. In two-component system, the correlation
function behaves in more complicated manner; its sign oscillates but the
envelope decays again very slowly and the decay is compatible with power-law
with exponent somewhat lower than 2. Therefore, our generalization of ASEP
belongs to different universality class than the ensemble of generalized ASEP
models which are mappable to zero-range processes.

Motivation: 解决长程相互作用晶格模型模拟中计算复杂度高的问题，提升模拟效率。

Method: 采用预决策方案，针对形式为$V(r)=r^{-d-\sigma}$的势能，将计算复杂度从$O(N^2)$降至$O(N^{2-\sigma/d})$或$O(N)$。

Conclusion: 该算法通用、简单且计算复杂度低，有望广泛应用于长程相互作用晶格模型的研究，尤其是在非平衡态物理中。

Abstract: We propose a fast and general predecision scheme for Metropolis Monte Carlo
simulation of $d$-dimensional long-range interacting lattice models. For
potentials of the form $V(r)=r^{-d-\sigma}$, this reduces the computational
complexity from $O\left(N^2\right)$ to $O\left(N^{2-\sigma/d}\right)$ for
$\sigma < d$ and to $O\left(N \right)$ for $\sigma > d$, respectively. The
algorithm is implemented and tested for several $\mathrm{O}(n)$ spin models
ranging from the Ising over the XY to the Edwards-Anderson spin-glass model.
With the same random number sequence it produces exactly the same Markov chain
as a simulation with explicit summation of all terms in the Hamiltonian. Due to
its generality, its simplicity, and its reduced computational complexity it has
the potential to find broad application and thus lead to a deeper understanding
of the role of long-range interactions in the physics of lattice models,
especially in nonequilibrium settings.

Abstract: Directed cycles form the fundamental motifs in natural, social and artificial
networks, yet their distinct computational roles remain under-explored,
particularly in the context of higher-order structure and function. In this
work, we investigate how two types of directed cycles - feedforward and
feedback - can act as higher-order structures to facilitate the flow and
integration of information in sparse random networks, and how these roles
depend on the environment of the cycles. Using information-theoretic measures,
we show that network size, sparsity and relative directionality critically
impact the information-processing capacities of directed cycles. In a network
with no-preferred global direction, a feedforward cycle enables greater
information flow and a feedback cycle allows for increased information
integration. The relative direction of a feedforward cycle as well as the
structural incoherence it induces, determines its capacity to generate
higher-order behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that introducing feedback loops
into otherwise feedforward architectures increases the diversity of network
activity patterns. These findings suggest that directed cycles serve as
computational motifs with local information processing capabilities that depend
on the structure they are embedded. Using directed cycles, we highlight the
interdependence between higher-order structures and the higher-order order
behaviour they can induce in the network dynamics.

Conclusion: SDEP为长程相互作用驱动的非局部流体动力学提供了一个可处理的例子。

Abstract: We study the symmetric Dyson exclusion process (SDEP) - a lattice gas with
exclusion and long-range, Coulomb-type interactions that emerge both as the
maximal-activity limit of the symmetric exclusion process and as a discrete
version of Dyson's Brownian motion on the unitary group. Exploiting an exact
ground-state (Doob) transform, we map the stochastic generator of the SDEP onto
the spin-$1/2$ XX quantum chain, which in turn admits a free-fermion
representation. At macroscopic scales we conjecture that the SDEP displays
ballistic (Eulerian) scaling and non-local hydrodynamics governed by the
equation $\partial_t \rho+\partial_x j[\rho]=0$ with
$j[\rho]=(1/\pi)\sin(\pi\rho(x,t))\sinh(\pi\mathcal{H}\rho(x,t))$, where
$\mathcal{H}$ is the Hilbert transform, making the current a genuinely
non-local functional of the density. This non-local one-field description is
equivalent to a local two-field "complex Hopf" system for finite particle
density. Closed evolution formulas allow us to solve the melting of single and
double block initial states, producing limit shapes and arctic curves that
agree with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The model thus offers a
tractable example of emergent non-local hydrodynamics driven by long-range
interactions.

Abstract: We numerically investigated the Brownian motion of active Janus particles in
a linear array of planar counter-rotating convection rolls at high P\'eclet
numbers. Similarly to passive particles, active microswimmers exhibit advection
enhanced diffusion, but only for self-propulsion speeds up to a critical value.
The diffusion of faster Janus particles is governed by advection along the
array's edges, whereby distinct diffusion regimes are observed and
characterized. Contrary to passive particles, the relevant spatial
distributions of active Janus particles are inhomogeneous. These peculiar
properties of active matter are related to the combined action of noise and
self-propulsion in a confined geometry and hold regardless of the actual flow
boundary conditions.

Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy, we investigated the
quasiparticle and spin dynamics in single crystals of bilayer nickelate
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the
presence of two distinct density wave (DW)-like orders, manifesting with onset
temperatures at $\sim$140 K and $\sim$115 K. Through time-resolved ellipticity
measurements, we identified the higher-temperature order at 140 K ($T_{\rm
SDW}$) as the onset of a spin density wave (SDW) with associated electronic
nematicity. In contrast, the lower-temperature order is attributed to a charge
order. A key finding is the differential response of these orders to
photoexcitation: the charge order is entirely suppressed at a pump fluence of
approximately 40 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, whereas the SDW order persists up to 200
$\mu$J/cm$^2$, albeit with its characteristic temperature suppressed to
approximately 70 K. These compelling experimental observations provide critical
insights into the coexistence and manipulability of density wave phenomena in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, laying a foundation for future research into their optical
control.

Abstract: It is well known that the anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic and strongly
paramagnetic metals in addition to electron skew scattering on impurities is
determined by internal mechanism linked to the Berry curvature, a
quantum-mechanical property of the electron states of a perfect crystal.
Experimentally, however, it has been established that the Berry curvature does
not play any role in the Hall resistance of the ferromagnet URhGe. URhGe is so
called altermagnetic ferromagnet which crystal symmetry includes operation of
time inversion only in combination with rotations and reflections. The
explanation for strictly zero Berry curvature of electronic states in this
material lies in the non-symmorphic symmetry of its crystal lattice.

Abstract: We explore a class of dynamical protocols - that we term loop quenches -
which are tailored for the study of symmetry-protected topological (SPT)
systems. In loop quenches, SPT phases can survive even out of equilibrium, thus
evading the dynamical violation of their protecting symmetry. Moreover, we
demonstrate that employing loop quenches allows to detect the equilibrium
topology via measurable dynamical quantities. Focusing on chiral-SPT phases, we
introduce the Loschmidt chirality amplitude as a key observable that encodes
the equilibrium topological invariant. We exemplify our method for
chiral-symmetric one-dimensional two-band insulators and propose a pump-probe
measurement scheme which allows to extract the amplitude in question. Our
protocol uncovers a direct dynamical signature of SPT phases and, most
importantly, paves the way for a general diagnostic framework that can be
extended to other symmetry classes and dimensions.

Abstract: We report Coulomb drag studies in an electron-hole bilayer graphene
heterostructure in a magnetic field, where the orbital, spin, and valley
degrees of freedom are lifted by the combined effects of exchange interaction,
Zeeman energy, and vertical displacement field. Our device enables the
application of a large vertical displacement field in both layers. In addition
to the well-established strong Coulomb drag between Landau levels with an
orbital quantum number N = 0, we observe a Coulomb drag signal between the N =
1 Landau levels under a suitable vertical displacement field. As the
displacement field increases further, the Coulomb drag signal between N = 1
Landau levels weakens, and a Coulomb drag signal emerges between the N = 0 and
N = 1 Landau levels. These findings suggest the important roles of the orbital
index and vertical displacement field in interlayer Coulomb interactions within
the quantum Hall regime of coupled bilayer systems.

Abstract: Recent introduction of superlattice potentials has opened new avenues for
engineering tunable electronic band structures featuring topologically
nontrivial moir\'{e}-like bands. Here we consider optoelectronic properties of
Bernal-stacked graphene subjected to a superlattice potential either
electrostatically or through lattice twisting to show that it exhibits a giant
shift current response that is orders of magnitude larger than existing
predictions in twisted mulitlayer systems. Effects of gate voltage and the
strength and phase of the superlattice potential on the shift current are
delineated systematically across various topological regimes. Our study gives
insight into the nature of nonlinear responses of materials and how these
responses could be optimized by tuning the superlattice potential.

Abstract: The planar Hall effect is a phenomenon that the Hall conductivity emerges
perpendicular to the electric field in the presence of an in-plane magnetic
field. We investigate the planar Hall effect in two-dimensional higher
symmetric $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$, where those with $X=d,g,i$ are
altermagnets. The $X$-wave magnet is characterized by the number $N_{X}$ of the
nodes in the band structure, where $N_{X}=1,2,3,4,6$ corresponding to
$X=p,d,f,g,i$. We demonstrate that the Hall conductivities are almost half
quantized and well approximated by the formula $\sigma _{xy}=\pm (e^{2}/2h)$
sgn$\left( J\sin N_{X}\Phi \right) $, where $J$ is the coefficient of the
coupling between the $X$-wave magnet and the electrons, and $\Phi $ is the
direction of the applied magnetic field. Hence, the Hall conductivity has the
periodicity with respect to $\Phi $, and the periodicity is equal to the number
$N_{X}$ of the nodes. This property may be used to confirm that the target
material is indeed an $X$-wave magnet. Furthermore, the sign of $J$ may be used
as a bit for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Abstract: We use charge sensing to detect entropy changes in a double quantum dot
defined by electrostatic gating of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. This system
can be tuned to be two separate systems, like two independent, artificial
atoms, or a single coherent system, like a molecule. We study entropy changes
in both regimes due to changes in the occupation of the system. First we
recover the single-dot result for each dot, that the occupation of the dot by a
single electron corresponds to an increase in the entropy of $k_{\mathrm{B}}
\log 2$. Next we examine two different charge transitions in the "molecular"
regime, and how it reveals itself in terms of the measured entropy. We also
uncover a realization of Pauli blockade that clutters the entropy signal. By
applying a rate equation model, we demonstrate the effect's nonequilibrium
origins and exclude it from the analysis of the system's entropy. Understanding
these experiments in this simplest coupled system enables the study of the
entropy in other, more complicated coupled quantum systems, such as ones with
topological or highly entangled ground states.

Conclusion: 扭曲角度可有效调控超导界面的临界电流，为超导器件设计提供新思路。

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting phase and perpendicular
Josephson supercurrent in twisted three-dimensional (3D) superconductors, where
two layered 3D materials are stacked with a relative twist. We formulate the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and develop a self-consistent method to
calculate the superconducting order parameter and the resulting supercurrent.
Applying this framework to a toy model with Fermi surfaces located near the
Brillouin zone corners, we demonstrate a phase discontinuity at the twisted
interface, indicating that a Josephson junction is formed purely by the twist.
Our calculations reveal that the interface supports a finite critical current
even when the Fermi surfaces of the two superconductors are completely
separated, unlike in the case of a twisted normal-metal interface. We further
show that the critical current can be effectively controlled by the twist
angle, transitioning from a high-transparency regime at small angles to a
low-transparency regime at larger angles.

Abstract: Driving non-topological materials out of equilibrium using time-periodic
perturbations, such as circularly-polarized laser light, is a compelling way to
engineer topological phases. At the same time, topology has traditionally only
been considered for crystalline materials. Here we propose an experimentally
feasible way of driving monolayer amorphous carbon topological. We show that
circularly polarized laser light induces both regular and anomalous edge modes
at quasienergies $0$ and $\pm \pi$, respectively. We also obtain complete
topological characterization using an energy- and space-resolved topological
marker based on the spectral localizer. Additionally, by introducing atomic
coordination defects in the amorphous carbon, we establish the importance of
the local atomic structure in topological amorphous materials. Our work
establishes amorphous systems, including carbon, as a versatile and abundant
playground to engineer topological phases.

Abstract: Fine-tuning the functional properties of nanomaterials is crucial for
technological applications. Superlattices, characterized by periodic
repetitions of two or more materials in different dimensions, have emerged as a
promising area of investigation. We present a study of the phonon interference
effect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp
interfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity
measurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice
nanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a
minimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to
room temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from
coherent to incoherent thermal transport. Notably, this effect is not destroyed
by surface boundary or by phonon-phonon scattering, as the crossover trend is
also observed at room temperature. Our results were corroborated by both ab
initio lattice dynamics and semiclassical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics
calculations. These findings provide insights into the wave-like and
particle-like transport of phonons in superlattice nanowires and demonstrate
the potential for engineering thermal properties through precise control of the
superlattice structure.

Abstract: We present a proposal for achieving light-induced superconductivity using
exciton polaritons - hybrid light-matter particles of excitons (bound
electron-hole pairs) and microcavity photons. In contrast to previous theories
of polariton-mediated superconductivity, which typically require multiple
semiconductor layers, we show that superconductivity can be induced within a
single semiconductor monolayer with inverted conduction bands, such as in the
tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides. The key ingredient is that we
can resonantly excite exciton polaritons into bands that are different from
those occupied by the doped electrons, thus avoiding any Pauli blocking
effects. Crucially, we can exploit the trion fine structure (i.e., multiple
exciton-electron bound states) and tune the electron-polariton interactions via
Feshbach resonances. Our theory of polariton-mediated superconductivity
includes the energy dependence of the polariton-mediated interactions between
electrons, as well as the polariton-induced changes to the electron
quasiparticles. We find that superconductivity at elevated temperatures is
within reach of current experiments.

Abstract: Electronic metadevices leveraging sub-wavelength metallic features have shown
great potential for high-frequency switching. Theoretical analysis based on a
one-dimensional (1D) model indicates that reducing the size of subwavelength
features can enhance electrical properties, such as contact resistance and
switching cutoff frequency. Here, we report higher-than-expected contact
resistance in electronic metadevices when the subwavelength feature size is
aggressively downscaled. We attribute this effect to transverse currents in the
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) running parallel to the stripe width. We
present the first experimental demonstration of a metadevice governed by a
one-dimensional model, which we refer to as a quasi-1D electronic metadevice
and show that it enables enhanced electrical performance. Our findings pave the
way to design next generation electronic metadevice switches with applications
in future telecommunication circuits.

Abstract: The linear (proportional to local vacancy concentration) term in specific
resistance of the material does not directly contribute to the change of
memristor's total resistance when the vacancies are redistributed inside while
keeping their total number constant. But it still changes kinetics of the
vacancy drift under the influence of a passing electric current. These changes
are especially significant in the presence of metal-insulator phase transition
in the memristor's material. In this paper, kinetic equation for local vacancy
concentration is obtained, and exact solutions for its steady states are
analyzed. It is shown that not only in the weakly nonlinear case (when the
dependence of the specific resistance on the vacancy concentration can be
neglected), but also in a strongly non-linear memristor with phase transition,
its kinetics can be reduced to the classical exactly solvable Burgers equation.
