Yet, the product states typically only span parts of a larger degenerate eigenspace. Here, we classify this eigenspace in the one-dimensional periodic XXZ chain at all roots of unity $q$, where $q^2$ is an $\\ell$-th primitive root of unity. For commensurate chain lengths $N$ with $q^N=1$, we prove that the minimal degeneracy is $2^{N/\\ell}\\ell$ using the representation theory of the affine Temperley-Lieb (aTL) algebra. For the incommensurate case, we derive analogous exponential lower bounds of $2^{2\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2\\ell}\\rfloor+1}$ if $N$ is even and $2^{2\\lfloor \\frac{N}{2\\ell}+\\frac{1}{2}\\rfloor}$ if $N$ is odd and $q^\\ell=1$. Our proof employs the morphisms between aTL modules discovered by Pinet and Saint-Aubin and emphasizes the importance of exact sequences and hidden twisted boundary condition sectors that mediate the degeneracy. In the case of commensurate chain lengths, we connect to the Fabricius-McCoy string construction of all Bethe roots of the degenerate subspace, which previously uncovered parts of our results. We corroborate our results numerically and demonstrate that the lower bound is saturated for chain lengths $N\\leq20$. Our work demonstrates for a concrete system how the interplay of the Bethe ansatz, aTL representation theory, and twisted boundary conditions explains degeneracy connected to long-lived product states, stimulating research towards generalization to higher dimensions. Exponential degeneracy could boost applications of spin chains as quantum sensors."}

Both are investigated by extending the framework of quantum generalized hydrodynamics to account for the underlying stochastic dynamics. We derive the evolution of the local quasiparticle occupation function, which characterizes the system at large space-time scales, and analyze the resulting entanglement spreading. By incorporating quantum fluctuations of the occupation function and employing conformal field theory techniques, we obtain the exact contribution to the entanglement entropy for each individual noise realization. Averaging over these realizations then yields the full entanglement statistics in the hydrodynamic regime. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by exact numerical calculations. The results presented here constitute the first application of quantum generalized hydrodynamics to stochastic quantum systems, demonstrating that this framework can be successfully extended beyond purely unitary dynamics to include stochastic effects."}

Distortion is introduced through controlled random displacements of lattice sites, thereby modifying nearest-neighbor distances. Bond occupation is permitted only when the bond length is smaller than a prescribed connection threshold, directly coupling geometric disorder to connectivity. Finite-size scaling analysis is employed to determine percolation thresholds for finite systems and in the thermodynamic limit. We find that when the connection threshold exceeds the nearest-neighbor distance of the undistorted lattice, the percolation threshold increases monotonically with distortion strength, indicating a systematic suppression of spanning. In contrast, this monotonic behavior breaks down when the connection threshold is below the nearest-neighbor distance of the undistorted lattice, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between geometric distortion and connectivity. We further identify critical values of the connection threshold and the distortion amplitude required for global spanning when all the allowed bonds are occupied. All qualitative behaviors remain robust across both lattice geometries. These results clarify how geometric disorder reshapes percolation in three-dimensional crystalline networks."}

We investigate the ``structural complexity'' of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model, a paradigmatic system exhibiting a second-order phase transition at a certain critical temperature which is often cited as a canonical example of complex morphology. We define a quantitative metric for this structural complexity, $\\mathcal C_s$, through the lens of algorithmic information theory by approximating the Kolmogorov complexity of lattice configurations via standard lossless image compression algorithms. We regularize our proposed metric, $\\mathcal C_s$, by comparing the compressibility of a configuration to that of its pixel-wise sorted and randomly shuffled counterparts. We arrive at a definition of $\\mathcal C_s$ as a product of two components representing the systems departure from perfect order and disorder respectively which we then plot as a function of temperature. Our numerical simulations reveal a distinct peak in $\\mathcal C_s$ at the known critical temperature $T_c$. This result demonstrates that such information-theoretic measures can act as sensitive, model-agnostic indicators of criticality, directly quantifying the emergence of complex structure at the boundary between order and chaos, opening the door to data-driven applications in domains where analytic solutions are unavailable."}

Among these, network pruning provides a clear and effective route to sparsity. We study pruning from a statistical-physics perspective, interpreting performance degradation under weight removal as a phase transition. Focusing on magnitude-based pruning with fine-tuning, we show that deep networks undergo a sharp transition from a cooperative, functional phase to a disordered phase with collapsed performance. This transition is characterized by scaling laws consistent with second-order critical behavior, with connectivity as the control parameter. Our findings suggest universal pruning-induced criticality across architectures and datasets. Finally, we show that there exists a large class of subnetworks sharing the same nodes' degrees with similar learning ability, thus linking model performance to its topological properties."}

The average number of photons radiated by a charged particle passing through a plate made of this metamaterial is obtained. Given the positions of the transition radiation maxima in momentum space for different velocities of a charged particle, the method for reconstruction of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in metamaterials is proposed. Applying this method conversely, one can predict the radiation spectrum and polarization properties of transition radiation by means of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in the metamaterial known, for example, from the effective model. It is shown that the strong spatial dispersion alters qualitatively the properties of transition radiation from a charged particle traversing normally a plate made of the helical metamaterial along its symmetry axis in the paraxial regime, viz., there is a nonzero forward radiation in contrast to transition radiation in media without strong spatial dispersion. Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation and the anomalous Doppler effect in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion are described."}

It is proven that the unique set of eigenfunctions or preferred basis exists for any non-isolated sub-system. Applying the new eigenvalue equation to the relative motion of a hydrogen atom together with the derived relativistic Hamiltonian to quantify the impact of finite proton mass to the fine structure, correction to the fine structure is obtained as a result of the entanglement of the relative motion and the center-of-mass motion, which can be used to verify the correctness of the proposed eigenvalue equation. Applying the equation to the measurement of electron double-slit interference, it is analyzed that the photon packets with Lorentzian spectral lineshape, the domain and state density of the sub-system, and the energy of the incident electron together determines the spontaneous emission rate of the incident electron. Photons generated in this process excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the detector. Corresponding to any emitted or absorbed photon, the sub-system is found to be uniquely determined by maximizing the transition rate. This new principle is valid for atoms too. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the transition rates and example numerical results show good correlation between calculation and the position measurement experiment. The discovered common mechanisms that determine the sub-systems, the preferred bases, and transition rates form the foundation of a new, general, and consistent theory of quantum measurement."}

The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\\infty}(S;λ)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the microcanonical setting, the \\emph{only} way $P_{\\infty}^{(E)}(S;λ)$ can remain the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally."}

Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$.

The analysis is carried out within the framework of the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach, which allows for a non-perturbative treatment of strong interspecies correlations while retaining analytical transparency. The BF interaction is modeled by a properly regularized attractive contact potential, enabling the exploration of both the attractive and repulsive energy branches. We determine the minimal BB repulsion required to ensure mechanical stability of the mixture by evaluating the inverse compressibility matrix over the full range of BF coupling strengths, within the domain of validity of the LOCV approximation. The interaction contribution to the energy is benchmarked against available experimental data and Quantum Monte Carlo results in the single-impurity limit, showing good agreement. Our analysis reveals how the critical BB coupling depends on interaction strength, density imbalance, and mass ratio. In particular, we find that mixtures with equal boson and fermion masses exhibit enhanced stability, requiring the smallest BB repulsion to prevent mechanical instability. In this case, a relatively small BB interaction is sufficient to stabilize attractive mixtures for all values of the BF interaction. These results provide a theoretical framework for assessing stability conditions in experimentally realizable two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions."}

The dynamics are governed by a Lindblad superoperator that drives all initial states toward a maximally mixed infinite-temperature steady state, isolating dynamical mechanisms from static equilibrium properties. Considering two representative quasiperiodic models, namely a tight-binding chain with a mosaic potential and its extension with power-law long-range hopping, we show that a properly engineered two-step protocol, in which the system is first steered to a finite temperature intermediate state, yields a strictly shorter overall relaxation time than direct evolution from the same initial configuration. This protocol-induced acceleration persists for both initially localized and extended eigenstates and remains robust in the presence of long-range hopping. A Liouvillian spectral analysis reveals that the mechanism originates from a redistribution of spectral weight that suppresses overlap with the slowest decay modes, rather than from any modification of the decay spectrum itself. Our results establish quasiperiodic chains as a controlled setting for engineering relaxation pathways through Liouvillian spectral structure."}

Ba4Ir3O10 has a quasi-2D structure composed of buckled sheets, which constitute corner-connected Ir3O12 trimers containing three distorted face-sharing IrO6 octahedra. The Ir atoms are distributed over two symmetrically inequivalent sites: the center of the trimer (Ir1) and its two tips (Ir2). The Ir1 - Ir2 distance within the trimer is quite small and equals to 2.58 A at low temperature. As a result, the clear formation of bonding and antibonding states at the Ir1 site occurs. The large bonding-antibonding splitting stabilizes the dyz-orbital-dominant antibonding state of t2g holes and produces a wide energy gap at the Fermi level. However, the energy gap opens up only with taking into account strong Coulomb correlations at the Ir2 site. Therefore, we have quite a unique situation when the insulating state is driven by both the dimerization at the Ir1 site and Mott insulating behavior at the Ir2 one. We have investigated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Ir L3 edge. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum possesses several sharp features below 2.1 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir t2g levels.

Layer-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magneto-transport, and compressibility measurements jointly determine the phase diagram. The high-field evolution of the antiferromagnetic state reveals a metamagnetic-like transition at a critical field B*, above which a Chern insulating transport response reappears. Our results establish the MoTe2/WSe2 moire platform as a tunable realization of an extended Kane-Mele-Hubbard model hosting sequential correlation-topology-intertwined transitions."}

These observables allow for a quantitative characterization of the quantum correlations present in a top quark--antiquark system, thus enabling an interpretation of collider data in terms of quantum states and their properties. Discord is observed to be greater than zero with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations ($σ$). Evidence for steering is found with a significance of more than 3$σ$. This is the first evidence for steering, and the first observation of discord in a high-energy system. No Bell correlation is observed within the currently probed phase space, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These results experimentally corroborate the full hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quarks with discord being the most basic form of quantum correlation, followed by entanglement, steering and Bell correlation. The significance of nonzero magic, which is a complementary observable to the quantum-correlation hierarchy, is found to exceed 5$σ$ in several regions of phase space."}

The heavy-tailed resets generate magnetisation distributions that differ significantly from both equilibrium dynamics and the previously studied Ising model with exponentially distributed reset times. In two dimensions, for $T > T_C$, we find a quasi-ferro state for all $α$, marked by a double-peaked distribution that diverges at $m=0$ and $m=m_0$; no steady state exists for $α< 1$, while a stationary state emerges for $α> 1$. For $T < T_C$, power law resetting produces two distinct regimes separated by a crossover exponent $α^* = 1-c$: a single-peak ferromagnetic phase localised at $m_{eq}$ for $α< α^*$, and a dual-peak ferromagnetic phase with divergences at $m_{eq}$ and $m_0$ for $α> α^*$.

In the compound Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, the main electronic bands closely resemble those of pristine 2H-TaS$_2$, with no clear signs of band folding. However, a shallow electron pocket, referred to as the $β$-feature, was detected at the Fermi level near the corner of the superlattice Brillouin zone. The surface vs bulk origin of this feature is debated, as it cannot be reproduced using standard DFT calculations. To resolve this, we employed cluster perturbation theory (CPT) to incorporating an exact treatment of strong electron correlations (U) on the cobalt sites, going beyond DFT+U approximation. To further substantiate this, we studied an underdoped sample, Co$_{0.22}$TaS$_2$, where a reduced charge transfer leads to different Co orbital character near the Fermi level. We find that its electronic structure closely resembles that of undoped 2H-TaS$_2$, and crucially, lacks the $β$-feature.

Upon dosing the dopants to Mott-insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we found a new Ru $3d$ photoemission peak emerging on the lower binding-energy side, suggesting the creation of a core-hole screening channel associated with coherent Ru $4d$ states around the Fermi level.

Suspended TMD monolayers provide an effective route to minimizing substrate-induced disorder. Here we demonstrate the spatially uniform excitonic spectrum from high-quality WSe2 suspended monolayers fabricated by gold-assisted exfoliation directly onto an Au contact electrode of a gate-tunable device. The resulting membranes span narrow suspended regions up to ~80 um and show spatially uniform photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures with neutral-exciton linewidths as low as ~4.5 meV, comparable to the narrowest values reported for high-quality monolayers. Spectral reproducibility across the suspended regions supports an intrinsic optical response, while gate-dependent measurements resolve multiple excitonic species.

In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states. These states are biphoton frequency combs, an example of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. Inspired by GKP codes, our protocol involves discretizing the continuous time and frequency degrees of freedom and encoding information by time-frequency displacements. This approach leverages the inherently large Hilbert space found in quantum frequency combs, with resilience against both temporal and spectral errors. In addition to describing the theoretical structure of the protocol, we propose an experimental implementation using standard telecommunication components, time-resolving single-photon detectors and a frequency beamsplitter. We also analyze the effect of experimental noise and errors on the channel capacity of the protocol. We demonstrate that for realistic experimental parameters, contemporary technologies satisfy the prerequisites for superdense coding with biphoton frequency combs, achieving a transmission rate of approximately 8.91 bits per transmitted photon (equivalent to 481 distinguishable messages with asymptotically vanishing errors). This more than doubles the previously highest transmission rate of 4 bits achieved by the Kwiat-Weinfurter scheme, while also having competitive optical loss. Furthermore, our results beat the rate achievable using a single-photon frequency comb with identical parameters by 4.6 times. Our protocol thus represents an experimentally feasible application of time-frequency grid states to entanglement-assisted communication, contributing to the active fields of continuous-variable and high-dimensional quantum information."}

This behavior reveals a dramatic efficiency advantage of physically realistic, finite-speed searchers over Brownian ones and illustrates how diffusive macroscopic models may be conceptually misleading in predicting the short-time behavior of a physical system.

In generalized LPFET (gLPFET), the embedding clusters are designed from a full-size gKS system where the (in-principle non-local) Hartree-Fock exchange potential is combined with a local (in the localized orbital representation) correlation potential. The latter is optimized self-consistently such that gKS and local embedding cluster's densities match. Unlike in DMET, which uses the same (global) chemical potential value in all clusters, each embedded orbital has its own chemical potential in gLPFET. We show analytically that, when electron correlation is strongly local, the latter potential becomes a simple functional of the correlation potential. Numerical calculations on model systems confirm the high accuracy of gLPFET in this regime, in contrast to DMET.

The reflection of the chemical field leads to an effective confinement of the particle, which itself is reflected before encountering the channel ends. The system displays a transition from a passive state, where the particle rests at the channel midpoint, to an active state characterized by highly regular, non-chaotic oscillations. We analytically construct the phase diagram and derive the oscillation frequency and amplitude in the vicinity of the transition.

We show that tuning the breathing asymmetry stabilizes extended quantum analogues of both rank-1 and rank-2 $U(1)$ Coulomb liquids within a single microscopic model, directly distinguished by their characteristic pinch-point morphologies in momentum space. This provides the first controlled quantum realization in three dimensions where gauge theories of different rank emerge within a single microscopic spin Hamiltonian.

We test this interpretation using controlled simulations of overdamped stochastic dynamics on curved surfaces in which local noise, geometry, and forces are held fixed while global constraints are varied. Trajectories are generated for particles evolving toward a central attractor, and entropy production is quantified using both a continuum probability-current estimator and coarse-grained Markov transition statistics across multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Across systematic sweeps of timestep size, domain extent, and boundary topology, entropy production is governed primarily by constraint-induced probability flow rather than local stochastic variability. Periodic domains that permit sustained circulation yield substantially higher entropy production than reflecting domains despite identical local stochastic structure, with the magnitude of the separation depending on domain extent. In contrast, coarse-grained estimates decrease as temporal resolution increases and rise with finer spatial binning, demonstrating that discrete estimates depend strongly on observation scale and may fail to resolve topology-induced irreversible structure. Ergo, entropy production is not a direct measure of environmental roughness or randomness. Instead, it quantifies how strongly system dynamics are driven away from reversibility by global constraints, geometry, and the space of allowed trajectories. Interpreted in this way, entropy production maps function as diagnostics of organized probability flow and provide a principled method for detecting hidden dynamical constraints from trajectory data alone."}

Building on the framework introduced in Gunn et al., Phys. Rev. B 111, 115110 (2025), we extend the analysis from abelian and class-2 nilpotent groups to all finite nilpotent groups. For any such symmetry group $G$, we construct explicit protocols composed of $G$-symmetric circuits and measurements with feedforward that transform symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states into the trivial phase and vice versa using a finite number of measurement rounds determined by the nilpotency class of $G$. Although these transformations are approximate, we prove that their success probability converges to unity in the thermodynamic limit, establishing asymptotically deterministic equivalence. Consequently, all SPT phases protected by finite nilpotent groups collapse to a single phase once symmetric measurements and feedforward are allowed. We further show that the same holds for non-normal MPS with long-range correlations, including GHZ-type states. The central technical ingredient is a hierarchical structure of irreducible representations of nilpotent groups, which enables a recursive reduction of non-abelian components to abelian ones. Our results demonstrate that symmetric measurements lead to a complete collapse of both symmetry-protected and non-normal MPS phases for all finite nilpotent symmetry groups."}

Our results demonstrate that both the charging energy and ergotropy of the quantum batteries can be significantly enhanced within the ultra-strong coupling regime and across a broader temperature range in transient time. A unidirectional energy flow is achieved by controlling the system's initial state through its two-mode squeezed ground state. Furthermore, we show that the steady-state stored energy, along with its corresponding ergotropy, can be enhanced at larger temperatures and stronger coupling strengths. Notably, a purely beam-splitter or two-mode squeezing interaction yields zero ergotropy. These findings indicate that the enhanced stored energy and ergotropy of the quantum battery arises principally from the combined effects of beam-splitter and parametric amplification (squeezing) couplings. In addition, the presence of the squared electromagnetic vector potential term can prevent a phase transition and achieve a significant charging energy and high ergotropy in the deep-strong coupling regime. The results presented herein enhance our understanding of the operating principles of open bosonic quantum batteries."}

The explicit form of the double elementary braiding matrices (DEBMs) in these models are derived from the F-matrices and R-symbols obtained via the q-deformed representation theory of SU(2). Using these EBMs, standard single-qubit gates are synthesized up to a global phase by a Genetic Algorithm-enhanced Solovay-Kitaev Algorithm (GA-enhanced SKA), achieving the accuracy required for fault-tolerant quantum computation with only 2-level decomposition. For two-qubit entangling gates, Genetic Algorithm (GA) yields braidwords of 30 braiding operations that approximate the local equivalence class [CNOT]. Theoretically, we demonstrate that performing double-braiding in a three-anyon (six-anyon) encoding of single-qubit (two-qubit) is topologically equivalent to a protocol requiring the physical manipulation of only one (three) anyons to execute arbitrary braids. Our numerical results provide strong evidence that double-braiding in SU(2)k anyons models is capable of universal quantum computation.

A key finding is that continuous coupling, unlike discrete coupling at finite points, breaks the constant phase difference condition, thereby weakening the interference effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. In addition, a key technical advantage of the SSE approach is that auto- and cross-correlation functions can directly reflect the complex photon emission/absorption processes and time-delay effects in giant atom-waveguide systems. Moreover, the SSE approach also naturally handles multiple excitations, without increasing equation complexity as the number of excitations grows. This feature enables the investigation of multi-excitation initial states of the waveguide, such as thermal and squeezed initial states. Overall, our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of giant atoms coupled to waveguide, particularly for continuous coupling and multi-excitation systems."}

To be specific, we derive the dynamical equations of an optomechanical system and demonstrate that the non-linearity (cause of chaos) in the equations arises entirely from the time-domain convolutions (TDCs) induced by non-Markovian corrections. Under Markovian conditions, these TDCs are reduced into constants, thereby losing the nonlinearity and ultimately leading to the disappearance of chaos. Furthermore, we also observe chaos generation in the absence of optomechanical couplings, which further confirms that the non-Markovian effect is the sole inducement of chaos and the environmental parameters play important roles in the generation of chaos. We hope these results may open a new direction to investigate chaotic dynamics purely caused by non-Markovian environments."}

The mechanism of the environment induced cat state transfer is analyzed both analytically and numerically to demonstrate that the transfer is a unique phenomenon in non-Markovian regime. From this example, the non-Markovian environment is shown to be qualitatively different from the Markovian environment reflected by the finite versus zero residue coherence. Besides, we also show the influence of environmental parameters are crucial for the transfer.

Our results reveal striking differences between state exclusion and the more familiar task of state discrimination. In particular, we show that LOCC antidistinguishability of multipartite product states is symmetric with respect to the initiating party but this symmetry breaks down for higher-order $x$-antidistinguishability. Most notably, we establish a manifestation of \\emph{nonlocality without entanglement} in the context of state exclusion: we prove that three bipartite product states can be globally antidistinguishable while failing to be LOCC antidistinguishable, demonstrating that three is the minimal number of states required for this phenomenon. We further extend this separation to $2$-antidistinguishability and present example exhibiting the same type of nonlocality.

Leveraging the well defined three-qubit structure with the four nested entanglement classes (S, B, W, and GHZ), we construct three distinct witness models ($\\mathcal{M}_{B}$, $\\mathcal{M}_{W}$, and $\\mathcal{M}_{GHZ}$) that sequentially discriminate between these classes. The proposed Cascaded model achieves an overall classification accuracy of $95\\%$ on a comprehensive dataset of mixed states. The framework's robustness and generalization capabilities are confirmed through rigorous testing against out-of-distribution (OOD) entangled states and various quantum noise channels, where the model maintains high performance. A key contribution of this research is an optimization protocol based on systematic feature importance analysis. This approach yields a tunable framework that significantly reduces the number of required features, while maintaining reliable model accuracy."}

In this article, we formulate three-photon interference in terms of ``each three-photon interfering only with itself.'' We show that although a generalized two-alternative three-photon interference setup based on CPDC or TOPDC involves eight different length parameters, the interference can be fully characterized in terms of only three independent parameters. The first parameter is the three-photon path-length difference, which has a direct analog in the one-photon and two-photon cases, and the other two parameters quantify the path-asymmetry length. Unlike two-photon interference, which requires only one parameter to quantify path-asymmetry, two independent parameters are needed in three-photon interference. This results in a broader class of nonclassical three-photon effects, including three-photon HOM-type effects. Our work provides the theoretical basis for existing and future three-photon interference experiments exploring the rich and complex quantum correlations associated with three-particle entanglement and potentially enabling the development of novel protocols for harnessing those correlations."}

In particular, the role of the self-generated magnetic field arising from electron motion and the feasibility of coherent spin control without disrupting diffraction coherence have not been quantitatively investigated. In this article, a self-consistent Maxwell-Pauli framework is developed to study spin-resolved electron diffraction from nanogratings in the presence of magnetic fields. The model incorporates geometric confinement, image-charge interactions, self-generated magnetostatic fields, and externally applied magnetic fields. Numerical simulations show that the intrinsic magnetic self-field produced by the electron probability current is several orders of magnitude too weak to induce measurable spin mixing, demonstrating that nanogratings act as spin-conserving beam splitters under field-free conditions. When a uniform magnetic field is applied upstream of the nanograting, coherent Larmor precession enables controlled spin rotation without modifying the diffraction geometry or degrading coherence. The magnetic field required for a $π$ spin rotation scales inversely with the interaction length and electron de Broglie wavelength $λ_{dB}$. Furthermore, a downstream nonuniform magnetic field applied after the nanograting imparts a spatially varying Zeeman phase, producing opposite transverse momentum shifts for the two spin components. The spin-dependent transverse dynamics is analyzed using Husimi Q-function phase-space maps, which visualize spin-dependent population redistribution and momentum separation. The proposed approach enables tunable spatial separation of spin-resolved free electron beams and establishes an all-magnetic route for coherent spin rotation, control, and interferometry."}

A multi-connected Jaynes--Cummings lattice is a one-dimensional lattice constructed from alternating qubits and resonators with different left and right couplings. The nearest-neighbour interaction or cross-Kerr coupling is implemented dispersively through ladder-type qutrits between each nearest neighboring pair of resonator modes. Projecting onto the lower-polaritonic manifold, we derive an extended two-mode (bipartite) Bose--Hubbard-like model featuring on-site and attractive nearest-neighbor interactions. Employing a continuum bosonization approach, we express the Hamiltonian in terms of symmetric ($+$) and antisymmetric ($-$) collective modes. In the regime where the ($-$) sector acquires a finite gap, one can reduce the system to an effective single-component Luttinger liquid model for the $+$ sector.

This has limited most previous demonstrations to laboratory settings or relied on sophisticated methods to maintain the necessary indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a scalable entanglement swapping experiment using naturally indistinguishable entanglement sources based on warm atomic vapor cells. Without sharing lasers or optical frequency references between nodes, nor the need for pulsing the sources, we achieve a swapping rate of nearly 500 pairs/s while maintaining the CHSH parameter above 2. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by maintaining the quality of the entanglement swapping on 17.6-km of deployed fibers in NYC, relying on commercially available SPADs at the spoke nodes, SNSPDs at the hub and standard time-synchronization techniques.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "In this paper, we provide a complete mathematical theory for the entanglement of mixtures of Dicke states. These quantum states form an important subclass of bosonic states arising in the study of indistinguishable particles. We introduce a tensor-based parametrization where the diagonal entries of these states are encoded as a symmetric tensor, enabling a direct translation between entanglement properties and well-studied convex cones of tensors. Our results bridge multipartite entanglement theory with semialgebraic geometry and the theory of completely positive and copositive tensors. This dictionary maps separability to completely positive tensors, the PPT property to moment tensors, entanglement witnesses to copositive tensors, and decomposable witnesses to sum of squares tensors. Using this framework, we construct explicit PPT entangled states in three or more qutrits. In this class of states, we establish that PPT entanglement exists for all multipartite systems with three qutrits or more, disproving a recent conjecture in [J. Math. Phys. 66, 022203 (2025)]. We also show that, for mixtures of Dicke states, the PPT condition with respect to the most balanced bipartition implies PPT with respect to any other bipartition. We further connect bosonic extendibility of mixtures of Dicke states to the duals of known hierarchies for non-negative polynomials, such as the ones by Reznick and Polya. We thus provide semidefinite programming relaxations for separability and entanglement testing in the Dicke subspace."}

Yet, the product states typically only span parts of a larger degenerate eigenspace. Here, we classify this eigenspace in the one-dimensional periodic XXZ chain at all roots of unity $q$, where $q^2$ is an $\\ell$-th primitive root of unity. For commensurate chain lengths $N$ with $q^N=1$, we prove that the minimal degeneracy is $2^{N/\\ell}\\ell$ using the representation theory of the affine Temperley-Lieb (aTL) algebra. For the incommensurate case, we derive analogous exponential lower bounds of $2^{2\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2\\ell}\\rfloor+1}$ if $N$ is even and $2^{2\\lfloor \\frac{N}{2\\ell}+\\frac{1}{2}\\rfloor}$ if $N$ is odd and $q^\\ell=1$. Our proof employs the morphisms between aTL modules discovered by Pinet and Saint-Aubin and emphasizes the importance of exact sequences and hidden twisted boundary condition sectors that mediate the degeneracy. In the case of commensurate chain lengths, we connect to the Fabricius-McCoy string construction of all Bethe roots of the degenerate subspace, which previously uncovered parts of our results. We corroborate our results numerically and demonstrate that the lower bound is saturated for chain lengths $N\\leq20$. Our work demonstrates for a concrete system how the interplay of the Bethe ansatz, aTL representation theory, and twisted boundary conditions explains degeneracy connected to long-lived product states, stimulating research towards generalization to higher dimensions. Exponential degeneracy could boost applications of spin chains as quantum sensors."}

We derive the evolution of the local quasiparticle occupation function, which characterizes the system at large space-time scales, and analyze the resulting entanglement spreading. By incorporating quantum fluctuations of the occupation function and employing conformal field theory techniques, we obtain the exact contribution to the entanglement entropy for each individual noise realization. Averaging over these realizations then yields the full entanglement statistics in the hydrodynamic regime. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by exact numerical calculations.

The dynamics are governed by a Lindblad superoperator that drives all initial states toward a maximally mixed infinite-temperature steady state, isolating dynamical mechanisms from static equilibrium properties. Considering two representative quasiperiodic models, namely a tight-binding chain with a mosaic potential and its extension with power-law long-range hopping, we show that a properly engineered two-step protocol, in which the system is first steered to a finite temperature intermediate state, yields a strictly shorter overall relaxation time than direct evolution from the same initial configuration. This protocol-induced acceleration persists for both initially localized and extended eigenstates and remains robust in the presence of long-range hopping. A Liouvillian spectral analysis reveals that the mechanism originates from a redistribution of spectral weight that suppresses overlap with the slowest decay modes, rather than from any modification of the decay spectrum itself. Our results establish quasiperiodic chains as a controlled setting for engineering relaxation pathways through Liouvillian spectral structure."}
