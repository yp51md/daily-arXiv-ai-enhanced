On many platforms, accessible Hamiltonians are largely restricted to one- and two-body interactions, limiting access to multi-body Hamiltonians and to systems governed by simultaneous, non-commuting interaction terms that are central to condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes. We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions. Our hardware-agnostic and scalable method opens new routes to realizing complex many-body physics across quantum platforms."}

Using the Fubini-Study formalism, we derive the metric tensor of the associated quantum state manifold and compute the corresponding Riemann curvature. Our analysis reveals that the system evolves over a smooth, compact, two-dimensional manifold with spherical topology and a dumbbell-like structure shaped by collective spin interactions. We further investigate the influence of the geometry and topology of the resulting state space on the behavior of geometric and topological phases acquired by the system. We explore how this curvature constrains the system's dynamical behavior, including its evolution speed and Fubini-Study distance between the quantum states. Within this geometric framework, we address the quantum brachistochrone problem and derive the minimal time required for optimal evolution, a result useful for time-efficient quantum circuit design. Subsequently, we explore the role of entanglement in shaping the state space geometry, modulating geometric phase, and controlling evolution speed and brachistochrone time. Our results reveal that entanglement enhances dynamics up to a critical threshold, beyond which geometric constraints begin to hinder evolution. Moreover, entanglement induces critical shifts in the geometric phase, making it a sensitive indicator of entanglement levels and a practical tool for steering quantum evolution. This approach offers valuable guidance for developing quantum technologies that require time-efficient control strategies rooted in the geometry of quantum state space."}

We establish a hierarchy of analytical mean-field approximations to the model, which characterizes nonequilibrium phase transitions between disorder and ordered phases, and perform a stability analysis. Generically, inhibitory neurons increase the stability of the model dynamics. The model is consistent with the quasi-criticality hypothesis in that it displays regions of maximal dynamical susceptibility and maximal mutual information predicated on the strength of the external stimuli. Directed percolation emerges as the universality class of the critical transition of the model, consistent with some previous experimental data and models. In the unstable phase, chaotic dynamics emerge, which may be linked to the occurrence of epileptic seizures."}

In this system, the excitations at low energies are described by four linearly dispersing modes characterized by two excitation velocities. Here we study the velocities in a system with equal interaction strengths and equal masses of bosons and fermions. The resulting model is integrable and admits an exact Bethe-ansatz solution. We analyze it and analytically derive various exact results, which include the Drude weight matrix. We show that the excitation velocities can be calculated from the knowledge of the matrices of compressibility and the Drude weights, as their squares are the eigenvalues of the product of the two matrices. The elements of the Drude weight matrix obey certain sum rules as a consequence of Galilean invariance. Our results are consistent with the presence of a momentum-momentum coupling term between the two subsystems of bosons and fermions in the effective low-energy Hamiltonian. The analytical method developed in the present study can be extended to other models that possess a nested Bethe-ansatz structure."}

E", "summary": "Nonlinear elements in a rectifying circuit can be used to harvest energy from thermal fluctuations either steadily or transitorily. We study an energy harvesting system comprising a small variable capacitor (e.g., free standing graphene) wired to two diodes and two storage capacitors that may be kept at different temperatures (or at a single one) and use two current loops. The system reaches very rapidly a quasi stationary state with constant overall charge while the difference of the charges at the storage capacitors evolves much more slowly to its stationary value. In this paper, we extract an exponentially small factor out of the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation and use a Chapman-Enskog procedure to describe the long evolution of the marginal probability density for the charge difference, from the quasi stationary state to the final stationary state (thermal equilibrium for equal temperatures). The second paper of this series shows that the results of the perturbation procedure compare well with direct numerical simulations. For a specific form of the diodes' nonlinear mobilities, we can approximate the quasi stationary state by Gaussian functions and further study the evolution of the marginal probability density. The latter adopts the shape of a slowly expanding pulse (comprising left and right moving wave fronts whose fore edges become sharper as time elapses) in the space of charge differences that leaves the final stationary state behind it."}

They occur close to the magnetic $T_c$ in low carrier density local moment magnets when the electron-spin coupling is comparable to the hopping scale. In non disordered systems the primary signatures are a modest non-monotonicity in the temperature dependent resistivity $ρ(T)$, and a magnetoresistance that can be $\\sim 20-30 \\%$ at $T_c$, at fields that, in energy units, are $\\sim 0.01 k_BT_c$. We find that structural disorder, in the form of pinning centers, promotes polaron formation, hugely increases the resistivity peak at $T_c$, and can enhance the magnetoresistance to $\\sim 80\\%$. The change in magnetoresistance with disorder is, however, non-monotonic. Too much disorder just creates an Anderson insulator - with the resistivity unresponsive to the magnetisation. This paper establishes the optimum disorder for maximising the magnetoresistance, suggests the physical process behind the unusual disorder dependence, and provides a magnetoresistance map - in terms of coupling and disorder - that locates some of the existing magnetic semiconductors within this framework."}

Transport measurements at filling factors v = 9/2 and 11/2 reveal conductive states giving way to well-developed plateaus with increasing displacement fields. These states are insensitive to an in-plane magnetic field, indicating single-component ground states and thus pointing at non-Abelian orders.

As of yet, this mass has not been observed in a superfluid. However, ultracold Fermi gases provide a promising platform in which recently much experimental progress was made, offering tunability of the interaction as well as control on the single-vortex level. Not only can the scattering length be freely tuned, allowing exploration of the BEC-BCS crossover, but also an imbalance between different pseudospin states can be introduced. We study the effect of introducing this imbalance on the vortex mass, using a method based on an effective field theory for superfluid Fermi gases. We find that it is crucial to consider the imbalance in conjunction with nonzero temperatures; at some temperatures, the vortex mass is significantly enhanced while at others, the vortex mass is diminished. This pronounced temperature dependence highlights the need for careful tuning of experimental conditions and identifies favorable parameter regimes in which the vortex mass is likely to be observed."}

The peak charge on the capacitor increases with temperature, capacitance, and diode quality. The second circuit has two current loops with one small capacitor, two storage capacitors, and two diodes wired in opposition. When the diodes are held at different temperatures we observe a non-zero steady-state charge is accumulated on both storage capacitors. The magnitude of the stored charges are nearly equal but the signs are opposite. When resistors are used in place of diodes there is no transient and no steady-state charge buildup. Numerical studies for the time-independent Fokker-Planck equation are presented and confirm the steady state charges."}

Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \\approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility. Finite-correlation-length scaling of the magnetization reveals a transition into a large-$U$ $120^\\circ$ Néel phase at $U_{c_2} \\approx 22.5$.

We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility.

We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels.

We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes.

But not all disorder is created equal. Disorder can be trivial or constrained, and correlated disorder can even be topological. Crucially, constrained disorder can harbor memory, leading to non-trivial, sequence-dependent responses to external manipulations. And yet the fascinating subject of \"memory of disorder\" remains poorly explored, as memory is often associated to the retention of metastable order. In recent years artificial frustrated materials -- in particular arrays of frustrated nanomagnets known as artificial spin ices -- have been employed to study complex disorders and its wealth of exotic behaviors, yet their memory properties have received much less attention. Here, we investigate both analytically and numerically the sequence-dependent responses of two somehow opposite yet related artificial spin ices: the Landau-ordered square spin ice and the disordered but topologically-ordered Shakti spin ice. We find that Shakti exhibits a pronounced sequence-dependent response, whereas in the square lattice, such path dependence is absent. Within Shakti, even the minimal periodic supercell demonstrates both deterministic and stochastic forms of sequence memory, depending on the interaction strength. Extending our study to cyclic driving, we find that retracing the same input path leads to enhanced memory retention. These results open new perspectives on how topological constraints and correlated disorder generate robust memory effects in frustrated artificial materials, hitherto examined mainly in terms of their ground-state kinetics and thermodynamics."}

Compared to chemical or mechanical approaches, ultrafast optical excitation further promises a path to create and manipulate novel non-equilibrium phases with ultimate spatiotemporal precision. However, achieving a truly nonvolatile electronic phase transition in laser-excited Mott systems remains an elusive challenge. Here, we present a highly robust and reversible method for optical control of the Mott state in van der Waals systems. Specifically, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a nonvolatile Mott-to-metallic transition in the ultrafast laser-excited charge density wave (CDW) material 1T-TaSe2. Complementary theoretical calculations reveal that this transition originates from a rearrangement of the interlayer CDW stacking. This new stacking order, formed following the ultrafast quenching of the CDW, circumvents the need for large-scale atomic sliding. Intriguingly, it introduces a significant in-plane component to the electron hopping and effectively reduces the ratio of on-site Coulomb interaction to bandwidth, thereby suppressing the Mott state and stabilizing a metallic phase. Our results establish optical-control of interlayer stacking as a versatile strategy for inducing nonvolatile phase transitions, opening a new route to tailor correlated electronic phases and realize reconfigurable high-frequency devices."}

This paper develops two complementary quantum formulations of the NDWT that embed these classical properties coherently into quantum computation. The first formulation is based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation of the NDWT and realizes all circularly shifted wavelet transforms simultaneously by promoting the shift index to a quantum register and applying controlled circular shifts followed by a wavelet analysis unitary. The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction. Together, these two approaches demonstrate that redundancy and translation invariance can be exploited rather than avoided in the quantum setting. Applications to denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling illustrate how quantum NDWTs provide a flexible and physically meaningful foundation for multiscale quantum signal processing."}

For $N>4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase.

BSB introduced Gaussian \\emph{spatial} correlations - originally developed in astrophysics to model turbulent density fluctuations - and demonstrated that even modest correlations suppress these pathological traps and restore Zwanzig's exponential scaling. Here we present here a unified theoretical framework clarifying (i) why Zwanzig's local averaging, may be viewed as a Gaussian cumulant expansion, could breakdown. In particular, how its validity is destroyed by uncorrelated disorder, and (ii) how Gaussian spatial correlations reshape roughness increments, eliminate asymmetric multi-site traps, and thereby recover mean-field diffusion, and (iii) a derivation showing exactly how Gaussian spatial correlations modify roughness increments, trap statistics, and ultimately the diffusion constant.

Quantum embedding (QE) theories address this limitation by mapping the system onto an auxiliary embedding Hamiltonian (EH) describing fragment-environment interactions, but the EH is typically large and its iterative solution is the primary computational bottleneck. We introduce a linear foundation model for QE that utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) to compress the space of quantum states needed to solve the EH within a small variational subspace. Using a data-driven active-learning scheme, we learn this subspace from EH ground states and reduce each embedding solve to a deterministic ground-state eigenvalue problem in the reduced space. Within the ghost Gutzwiller approximation (ghost-GA), we show for a three-orbital Hubbard model that a variational space learned on a Bethe lattice is transferable to square and cubic lattices without additional training, while substantially reducing the cost of the EH step. We further validate the approach on plutonium, where a single variational space reproduces the energetics of all six crystalline phases while reducing the cost of the EH solution by orders of magnitude. This provides a practical route to overcome the main computational bottleneck of QE frameworks, paving the way for high-throughput ab initio simulations of strongly correlated materials at a near-DFT cost."}

Based on bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field theory, we show that this feedback drives a spontaneous ferroelectric transition in the magnon superfluid, accompanied by a persistent magnon supercurrent. In the resulting ferroelectric phase, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum becomes nonreciprocal, reflecting spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry. At the critical point of the transition, the bosonic BdG Hamiltonian exhibits coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forming an exceptional point.

The resulting current-driven spin density in graphene generates a self-SOT on the Dirac electrons. The proximity-induced exchange field breaks time-reversal symmetry and gives rise to a purely odd SOT component, while the even contribution vanishes. The torque magnitude exhibits a strong angular dependence with phase shifts arising from the noncollinearity between the CrSBr magnetization and the induced magnetic moments in graphene. Monte Carlo simulations based on the calculated exchange parameters predict a Curie temperature of approximately 304 K, confirming the robustness of ferromagnetism in the trigonal CrSBr monolayer.

In this work, we derive a tight performance bound for magnetic-field sensing with a spin ensemble in the presence of dissipation. The metrological performance is quantified by the integrated metrological gain (IMG), which explicitly incorporates the time evolution of the measurement apparatus. By combining the Lindblad master equation with the quantum Fisher information, we obtain analytically exact trade-off relations between the IMG and the dissipation rate for local dephasing and local emission processes, showing that the gain scales inversely with the dissipation strength. This trade-off complements the Heisenberg limit, which addresses only the scaling with the number of spins and neglects dissipative dynamics. We analyze various initial state preparations and elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in the presence of dissipation. Notably, while entanglement is essential for achieving Heisenberg scaling at short times, it also accelerates dissipative degradation during time evolution. Consequently, for sufficiently long observation times, comparable metrological performance can be achieved even without entanglement."}

Following this recipe guarantees the obtainment of a QECC within the stabilizer formalism and nearly exhausts all possible constructions. As examples, we demonstrate that our construction recovers the HGP construction when D = 2 and leads to four distinct types of constructions for D = 3, including a previously studied case as one of them. When the input classical codes are repetition codes, our D = 3 constructions unify various three-dimensional lattice models into a single framework, encompassing the three-dimensional toric code model, a fracton model, and two other intriguing models not previously investigated. Among these, two types of constructions exhibit a trade-off between code distance and code dimension for a fixed number of qubits by adjusting the lengths of the different classical codes, and the optimal choice can simultaneously achieve relatively large values for both code distance and code dimension.

We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility.

We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band.\n  We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach.

Advances in this field have clarified that doped charges in cuprates exhibit remarkably rich collective behavior, governed by the combined effects of strong electronic correlations, the intrinsic layered crystal structure, and long-range Coulomb interaction. First, the emergence of acousticlike plasmons has been firmly established through quantitative analyses of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra based on the t-J-V model -- an extension of the conventional t-J model that incorporates the layered crystal structure and the long-range Coulomb interaction V. These acousticlike plasmons arise near the in-plane momentum q=(0,0) and possess characteristic energies far below the well-known ~ 1 eV optical plasmon. This behavior is found to be universal across both hole- and electron-doped cuprates, including multilayer systems. Second, in electron-doped cuprates, a pronounced tendency toward d-wave bond-charge order develops near q=(0.5pi, 0), as revealed by resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) and RIXS. As a result, the charge dynamics acquires a dual structure, in which low-energy bond-charge excitations coexist with relatively high-energy plasmons. Third, analogous signatures of charge-order tendency have also been reported in hole-doped cuprates. However, a direct application of the d-wave bond-charge-order framework fails to account for experimental observations.

Assuming that mobile carriers behave in a largely universal manner across electron- and hole-doped systems, we discuss a possible scenario that may reconcile these diverse experimental findings."}

Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices."}

The polaron picture is a method capable of analyzing in the entire coupling regime and extracting the essential physics behind the QPT. However, the asymmetric deformation of polarons is missing in the current polaron picture. In the present work we propose an improved variational method in asymmetric polaron picture (APP). Our APP not only increases the method accuracy but also reveals more underlying physics concerning the QPT. We find that in the ground state both the polarons and antipolarons are asymmetrically deformed to a large extent, which leads to a richer phase diagram. We also analyze the first excited state in which we unveil an asymmetry direction reversal for the polarons and an attraction/replusion transition differently from the ground state. Finally, we apply the APP in quantum Fisher information analysis and critical coupling extraction, the improvements indicate that the polaron asymmetry makes a considerable contribution to the quantum resource in quantum metrology and plays an unnegligible role in the QPT. Our results and mechanism clarifications expose more subtle energy competitions and abundant physics, and the method potentially might have broader applications in light-matter interactions."}

Surprisingly, we found that applying electric stimuli to the irradiated material induces a non-thermal insulator-to-metal transition, which results in low-power, repeatable volatile resistive switching. Magnetotransport measurements revealed that this voltage-induced metallic phase in the irradiated material is ferromagnetic, exhibiting clear anisotropic magnetoresistance. This work, thus, reports the discovery of a unique material in which the electrical triggering of the electronic phase transition results in the onset of magnetism, in stark contrast to the magnetic order suppression commonly observed in other metal-insulator transition switching materials.

Specifically, the collection of second cohomology groups, $H^2(Γ_F,\\mathbb{Z})$, for all MCGs $Γ_F$, provides an exhaustive classification of Abelian crystalline topological insulators, serving as an effective approximation to the full crystalline topological classification. Meanwhile, the third cohomology groups $H^3(Γ_F,\\mathbb{Z})$ across all MCGs exhaustively classify all possible twistings of point-group actions on the Brillouin torus, essential data for twisted equivariant K-theory.

By examining the distribution of energy level spacings through the level spacing ratio, we delineate the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes and characterize the emergence of quantum chaos in these systems. Our analysis demonstrates that non-local couplings facilitate faster operator spreading and more intricate dynamical behavior, enabling these systems to approach maximal chaos more readily than their local counterparts. Additionally, we analyze Krylov complexity as a dynamical probe of chaos, observing a characteristic peak followed by a plateau at late times in chaotic regimes. This behavior provides a quantitative means to distinguish between integrable and chaotic phases, with the growth rate and saturation level of the complexity serving as effective indicators.

We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels.

Because the approximation ratio depends on the optimal solution, which is typically elusive and difficult to ascertain a priori, the second novel component is to construct the upper bound of the optimal solution through the current quantum state. By enforcing the non-decreasing property of this Lyapunov function, we not only derive a class of quantum dynamics that can be simulated by quantum devices but also obtain rigorous bounds on the achievable approximation ratio. As a concrete demonstration, we apply our framework to Max-Cut problem, implementing it as an adaptive variational quantum algorithm based on a Hamiltonian ansatz. This algorithm avoids ansatz and graph structural assumptions and bypasses parameter training through a tunable parameter function integrated with measurement feedback."}

Using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, we identify circularly polarized phonons in ferro-rotational MnTiO$_3$, which we term ferro-rotational phonons. Their excitations provide a direct demonstration of non-reciprocal XCD in a system that globally preserves inversion and time-reversal symmetries.

Starting from a Hubbard-Peierls description, we derive an effective field-theoretic functional in which the inverse local susceptibility defines a phase-rigidity scale controlled by system size and electronic correlations. This rigidity quantifies the resistance of a coherent many-body state to geometric deformation of its phase structure, rather than to energetic localization. We demonstrate that interactions enhance phase rigidity in finite systems, counter to naive expectations based on single-particle localization, and that rigidity loss may occur without a direct correspondence to gap formation.

These effects are becoming increasingly important for experiments involving electrons, photons, atoms, and ions, particularly with the advent of attosecond spectroscopy and metrology. Here, we propose a general method for describing the emission of photons in phase space via a Wigner function. Several effects for Cherenkov radiation are predicted, absent in classical realm or in quantum theory in momentum space, such as a finite spreading time of the photon, finite duration of the flash and a quantum shift of the photon arrival time. The photon spreading time turns out to be negative near the Cherenkov angle, the flash duration is defined by the electron packet size, and the temporal shift can be both positive and negative. The characteristic time scales of these effects lie in the atto- and femtosecond ranges, thereby illustrating atomic origins of these macroscopic phenomena. The near-field distribution of the photon field resembles the electron packet shape, thus making ``snapshots'' of the emitter wave function.

We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions. Our hardware-agnostic and scalable method opens new routes to realizing complex many-body physics across quantum platforms."}

Based on bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field theory, we show that this feedback drives a spontaneous ferroelectric transition in the magnon superfluid, accompanied by a persistent magnon supercurrent. In the resulting ferroelectric phase, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum becomes nonreciprocal, reflecting spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry. At the critical point of the transition, the bosonic BdG Hamiltonian exhibits coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forming an exceptional point.

We validate our method by analyzing the steerability of two-qubit Werner and two-qutrit isotropic states. For Werner states, our approach saturates the analytical visibility bounds under three Pauli measurements, arbitrary projective measurements (PVMs), and arbitrary positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs). For isotropic states, we achieve the known analytical bounds under arbitrary PVMs. We further investigate the steerability of this class of states under arbitrary POVMs, and our results suggest that POVMs can offer an advantage over PVMs in revealing the steerability of such states."}

Specifically, the collection of second cohomology groups, $H^2(Γ_F,\\mathbb{Z})$, for all MCGs $Γ_F$, provides an exhaustive classification of Abelian crystalline topological insulators, serving as an effective approximation to the full crystalline topological classification. Meanwhile, the third cohomology groups $H^3(Γ_F,\\mathbb{Z})$ across all MCGs exhaustively classify all possible twistings of point-group actions on the Brillouin torus, essential data for twisted equivariant K-theory.

In the absence of population inversion, the ergotropy is fully consistent with coherent ergotropy; in local and global population inversion, it is determined by both coherent and incoherent ergotropy. Via random sampling of quantum states and Hamiltonians, we show that coherence and the participation ratio enhance coherent ergotropy, whereas incoherent ergotropy--whether enhanced, unchanged, or suppressed--depends on diagonal entropy, the participation ratio, and energy level population ordering. We demonstrate that the ergotropy lower bound is incoherent ergotropy, the upper bound is the QB stored energy, and enhanced QB purity suppresses locked energy and boosts charging efficiency. Furthermore, we use the Tavis-Cummings (TC) and Jaynes-Cummings (JC) batteries as paradigms to validate our findings.

As examples, we demonstrate that our construction recovers the HGP construction when D = 2 and leads to four distinct types of constructions for D = 3, including a previously studied case as one of them. When the input classical codes are repetition codes, our D = 3 constructions unify various three-dimensional lattice models into a single framework, encompassing the three-dimensional toric code model, a fracton model, and two other intriguing models not previously investigated. Among these, two types of constructions exhibit a trade-off between code distance and code dimension for a fixed number of qubits by adjusting the lengths of the different classical codes, and the optimal choice can simultaneously achieve relatively large values for both code distance and code dimension.

By encoding self-referential or contradictory propositions into a quantum state, the circuit uses interference effects to suppress inconsistent outcomes while preserving coherent ones. We demonstrate this with the Liar Paradox (\"This statement is false\"), showing that the quantum model naturally stabilizes truth values that would be paradoxical classically. The framework builds on orthomodular quantum logic treating logical propositions as subspace projectors and connects to belief revision and cognitive modeling by providing a physical mechanism for coherence restoration in epistemic states.

While this is relatively easy in the case of pure states, it is much more intricate for the case of mixed quantum states especially with higher dimension and more particles in the system. We present here an overview of the theory along this line. We outline most of the results in this field historically and focus on the finite-dimensional systems. In particular we emphasize the point of view that (i) which yardsticks haven been applied in quantifying entanglement and its distribution, (ii) what are the substantive characteristics and interrelations of these measures and their monogamy relations mathematically by comparing, and (iii) which concepts should be improved or revised and how they were developed accordingly."}

Building on the scaling strategy from our previous work, where we tailored a VQE workflow to both the DPO formulation and the target QPU, we now put forward two significant advances. The first is the implementation of the Ising Sample-based Quantum Configuration Recovery (ISQR) routine, which improves solution quality in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems. The second is the use of the VQE Constrained method to decompose the optimization task, enabling us to handle DPO instances with more variables than the available qubits on current hardware. These advances, which are broadly applicable to other optimization problems, allow us to address a portfolio with a size relevant to the financial industry, consisting of up to 38 assets and covering the full Spanish stock index (IBEX 35).

Classical fluctuation theorems, which capture the statistical behaviour of thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, are now well established. Their quantum counterparts, however, remain an active area of research. In this review, we highlight recent advances by linking quantum fluctuation theorems with linear response theory, offering new insights into the nature of quantum fluctuations and irreversibility in the near-equilibrium regime. Particular emphasis is placed on dissipated work in quantum systems as a pathway to observing non-classical effects in quantum thermodynamics. Understanding quantum fluctuations is not only essential for clarifying the foundations of irreversibility but also crucial for the development of novel quantum technologies, including quantum computers, sensors, and metrological devices."}

It has been classified into three distinct types: quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and Bell's nonlocality. In 1991, Gisin presented a fundamental theorem on Bell's nonlocality, pointing out all pure entangled states possess Bell's nonloclaity. Many of the core protocols of quantum information science (such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, and certain algorithms in quantum computing) rely on entanglement. Gisin's theorem tells us that as long as we successfully prepare a pure entangled state, we then have a Bell-nonlocality resource that can show the non-classical correlations. Such a resource is not ``virtual'' and can be tested and used through Bell-experiments. Similarly, in this work, we present a Gisin-like fundamental theorem on EPR steering, which indicates all rank-2 (and rank-1) entangled states possess EPR steerability. Thus all rank-2 entangled states can be applicable as EPR-steering resources in quantum information."}

To highlight the impact of nonlocal media, such as salt solutions, we predict that a new contribution to the resonance interaction energy emerges in a form $\\propto e^{-κ_{\\rm D} ρ}/ρ$. Here $κ_{\\rm D}$ is the Debye length and $ρ$ is the distance between the atoms. This contribution vanishes at zero temperature, where a new term proportional to $1/ρ^4$ (similar to free space) occurs. This new term is dampened by the electrolyte at large distances, causing it to decrease much faster, proportional to $1/ρ^7$. The long-range electrolyte-induced resonance interaction at finite temperature may, in addition to the dominating van der Waals attraction (which goes as $1/ρ^6$), take part in the molecular formation of biological fluids."}

Although variational quantum algorithms offer promising new approaches that may eventually outperform classical schemes, they suffer from resource constraints and trainability issues such as barren plateaus, making large-scale instances intractable on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In this paper, we propose an enhanced distributed variational quantum eigensolver for large-scale MaxCut problems, which extends our prior distributed variational quantum eigensolver framework by integrating a novel hybrid classical-quantum perturbation strategy, enhances optimization scalability and efficiency. Our algorithm solves weighted MaxCut instances with up to 1000 vertices using only 10 qubits, and numerical results indicate that it consistently outperforms the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. We further employ a warm-start initialization strategy, seeding the algorithm with high-quality solutions from the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, with results confirming that the optimal classical solution can be effectively further improved. The practical utility of the proposed algorithm is further validated through its application to haplotype phasing on genome sequencing data of the human ABCA1 gene, producing high-quality haplotypes that rival those obtained by the Goemans-Williamson algorithm with $10^6$ projections. These results establish the proposed algorithm as a scalable, NISQ-compatible framework for near-term quantum-enhanced large-scale combinatorial optimization."}

Based on this idea, we use dynamical typicality to predict the thermal state of ultracold Rb atoms exchanging energy via long-range dipole-dipole interactions. In a magneto-optical trap, we excite the atoms to the center of a manifold of nearly harmonically spaced clusters of Stark energy levels and then allow them to equilibrate. Comparing the equilibrium state to our thermal prediction across a range of densities, we find that the atoms generally fail to thermalize, though they approach the thermal state at the highest tested density."}

By the Naimark extension theorem, an IC measurement may be realized by a von Neumann measurement on an extended system after a suitable interaction. In this work, we elaborate on a simple algorithm for realizing Naimark extensions for rank-one Weyl-Heisenberg covariant informationally complete measurements in arbitrary finite dimensions. Exploiting Weyl-Heisenberg covariance, we show that the problem reduces to determining a $d \\times d$ unitary from which the full $d^2 \\times d^2$ unitary interaction can be constructed. The latter unitary enjoys a block-circulant structure which allows e.g., for an elegant optical implementation. We illustrate the procedure with explicit calculations for qubit, qutrit, and ququart SIC-POVMs. Finally, we show that from another point of view, this method amounts to preparing an ancilla system according to a so-called fiducial state, followed by a generalized Bell-basis measurement on the system and ancilla. These results provide a straightforward framework for implementing informationally complete measurements in the laboratory suitable for both qubit and qudit based systems."}

In this letter, we propose a general and explicit construction recipe for QECCs from a total of D classical codes for arbitrary D. Following this recipe guarantees the obtainment of a QECC within the stabilizer formalism and nearly exhausts all possible constructions. As examples, we demonstrate that our construction recovers the HGP construction when D = 2 and leads to four distinct types of constructions for D = 3, including a previously studied case as one of them. When the input classical codes are repetition codes, our D = 3 constructions unify various three-dimensional lattice models into a single framework, encompassing the three-dimensional toric code model, a fracton model, and two other intriguing models not previously investigated. Among these, two types of constructions exhibit a trade-off between code distance and code dimension for a fixed number of qubits by adjusting the lengths of the different classical codes, and the optimal choice can simultaneously achieve relatively large values for both code distance and code dimension. Our general construction protocol provides another perspective for enriching the structure of QECCs and enables the exploration of richer possibilities for good codes."}

Starting from a phenomenological error model of charge-conserving noise, we study the optimal decoder assuming the local charges of each anyon can be measured. The error threshold of the optimal decoder corresponds to a continuous phase transition in a disordered two-dimensional integer loop model on the Nishimori line. Using an effective replica field theory analysis and Monte Carlo numerics, we show that the optimal decoding transition exhibits Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality with a modified universal jump in winding number variance. We further generalize the model beyond the Nishimori line, which defines a large class of suboptimal decoders. At low nonzero temperatures and strong disorder, we find numerical evidence of a disorder-dominated loop-glass phase which corresponds to a \"confidently incorrect\" decoder. The zero-temperature limit defines the minimum-cost flow decoder, which serves as the ${\\rm U}(1)$ analog of minimum-weight perfect matching in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological codes. Both the optimal and minimum-cost flow decoders are shown to dramatically outperform the charge-agnostic optimal decoder in symmetry-enriched topological codes."}

By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges.\n  We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N>4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases."}

Recent work has recognized that when these symmetries are realized projectively, momentum space inherently accommodates nonsymmorphic symmetries, thereby evoking the concept of \\textit{momentum-space crystallographic groups} (MCGs). Here, we reveal that the cohomology of MCGs encodes fundamental data of crystalline topological band structures. Specifically, the collection of second cohomology groups, $H^2(Γ_F,\\mathbb{Z})$, for all MCGs $Γ_F$, provides an exhaustive classification of Abelian crystalline topological insulators, serving as an effective approximation to the full crystalline topological classification. Meanwhile, the third cohomology groups $H^3(Γ_F,\\mathbb{Z})$ across all MCGs exhaustively classify all possible twistings of point-group actions on the Brillouin torus, essential data for twisted equivariant K-theory. Furthermore, we establish the isomorphism $H^{n+1}(Γ_F,\\mathbb{Z})\\cong H^n\\big(Γ_F,\\operatorname{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))\\big)$ for $ n\\ge 1$, where $\\operatorname{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))$ denotes the space of continuous $U(1)$-valued functions on the $d$D momentum space $\\mathbb{R}^d_F$.

The case $n=2$, analogously, provides a fully algebraic description for all such twistings.

We improve the algorithm by expanding the range of site rearrangement and apply it to a one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model with random site permutation. The results indicate that increasing the range of the site rearrangement significantly improves the computational accuracy of the DMRG method. In particular, increasing the rearrangement range from two to three sites reduces the average relative error in the ground-state energy by 65% to 94% in the cases we tested.
