A well-established measure to quantify the system's distance from\nequilibrium is the informatic entropy production rate. Here, we ask the\nquestion whether and how the informatic entropy production rate reflects\ncollective behaviors and transitions in an active mixture with non-reciprocal\npolar couplings. In such systems, non-reciprocal orientational couplings can\ninduce chiral motion of particles. At the field-theoretical level, transitions\nto these time-dependent chiral states are marked by so-called exceptional\npoints. Here, we show that at a particle level, the entropy production rate\nwithin the chiral states increases with the degree of non-reciprocity, provided\nit is sufficiently strong. Moreover, even at small degrees of non-reciprocity,\nthe transitions via exceptional points leave clear signatures in the entropy\nproduction rate, which exhibits pronounced peaks at coupling strengths\ncorresponding to the field-theoretical exceptional points. Overall, the\nincrease and peaks of the entropy production rate mirror the susceptibility of\nthe polarization order parameter at the particle level. This correspondence is\nsupported by a field-theoretical analysis, which reveals that, in the\nlong-wavelength limit, the entropy production rate scales with the\nsusceptibilities of the polarization fields."}

The effects of\nfrustration and massive degeneracies at high energy, where the many-body\ndynamics becomes chaotic, have hitherto been far less explored. Here, we\nidentify a high-energy dynamical analog of highly-frustrated magnetism, in the\nform of an extensive manifold of classical ''interaction-suppressing''\nconfigurations giving rise to unstable periodic orbits. These are in general\nneither protected by symmetry nor integrability, and emerge from a set of\ndynamical local constraints that effectively nullify the interactions while\nallowing extensively many local degrees of freedom. The proliferation of\nunstable periodic orbits corresponds in the quantum case to ''hyperscarring'',\nthat is, quantum scarring on exponentially many unstable periodic orbits. On\nthe product states associated to the latter, the amplitudes of the mid-spectrum\nthermal eigenstates exhibit a power-law distribution, in stark contrast to the\nexpected exponential Porter-Thomas distribution that holds for generic product\nstates.

While so far, the measurement techniques rely either on\nindirect methods or on single particle studies, herein we introduce a new\nmethod to study MXs in QD ensembles utilizing spectrally resolved time-gated\nheralded spectroscopy. With this approach we extract the biexciton binding\nenergies in a series of CdSe/CdS QD ensembles of several core/shell sizes,\nmanifesting a transition between attractive and repulsive exciton-exciton\ninteractions. Additionally, for triexcitons, which involve occupation of two\nexcitons in the 1s energy levels, as well as one exciton in the 1p energy\nlevels, we address the open issues of isolating the spectra of the two\ntriexciton pathways from one another and from high-order MXs, and extract the\nMX lifetimes. The measurements on ensembles provide high photon counts and low\nnoise levels, and alongside the time-gated heralded approach thus enable the\nobservation of MX characteristics that are difficult to resolve in single\nparticle studies. The approach can be further implemented in the\ncharacterization of the energies and lifetimes of MXs in other QD systems to\nenable rapid characterization and understanding of the MX properties.

Furthermore, the classical participants require only two capabilities\ninstead of three, namely: (a) performing measurements in the $Z$ basis; and (b)\nreordering qubits.

To address\nthis problem, we propose an automated method for quantifying error sources by\ncombining simulation and parameter optimization to reproduce the experimental\ndensity matrix. We focus on the experimental generation of time-bin entangled\nphoton pairs, for which we model the relevant error sources and simulate the\ndensity matrix with adjustable model parameters, thereby optimizing the\nparameters and minimizing the trace distance to the experimental data.\nOptimization of the parameters reduced the trace distance from 0.177 to 0.024,\nindicating that our modeled error sources explain 86% of the errors.
