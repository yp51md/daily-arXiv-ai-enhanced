Comparison with accurate results obtained\nwith the force theorem (FT) reveals significant discrepancies in the dependence\nof the MCA energy on the Co thickness. For systems with strong SOC, the PT\nfails to correctly describe the oscillations of the MCA energy, largely\noverestimating their amplitude and even failing (for Co/Pt bilayers) to\nreproduce their specific periodicity. These failures specifically concern the\ndominating oscillations with the 2-monolayer period which arise from pairs of\nquantum well (QW) minority-spin d states in the Co layer, degenerate at the\ncentre of the Brillouin zone (BZ). A simplified model of such states\ndemonstrates that the large discrepancies between PT and FT predictions arise\nfrom the breakdown of the PT in a region around the BZ centre where the energy\nspacing between states within each pair is small compared to the SOC strength.\nThe oscillation amplitude of the MCA energy calculated with the FT is limited\nby the finite energy spacing between consecutive QW pairs, whereas this\namplitude grows quadratically with the SOC strength in the PT calculations.\nFurthermore, for weak and moderate SOC strengths, the accuracy of the PT\ndiminishes with increasing the ratio of the SOC constant to temperature.

This classical\nphenomenon is known as Taylor-Aris dispersion. Besides, microorganisms, such as\nactive microswimmers, exhibit an effective diffusive behavior at long times.\nCombining the two ingredients above, a natural question then emerges on how the\neffective diffusion of active microswimmers is altered in shear flows - a\nwidespread situation in natural environments with practical implications, e.g.\nregarding biofilm formation. In this Letter, we investigate the motility and\ndispersion of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii microalgae, within a rectangular\nmicrofluidic channel subjected to a sinusoidal Poiseuille flow. Using\nhigh-resolution optical microscopy and a particle-tracking algorithm, we\nreconstruct individual trajectories in various flow conditions and\nstatistically analyze them through moment theory and wavelet decomposition. We\nfind that the velocity fluctuations and the dispersion coefficient increase as\nthe flow amplitude is increased, with only weak dependencies on the flow\nperiodicity. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the generalization of\nTaylor-Aris law to active particles is valid."}

We\nconsider a realistic non-Markovian noise model that affects both the Larmor\nfrequency and exchange energy of qubits, allowing accurate simulations of noisy\nquantum circuits. We employ numerical emulation to assess the performance of\nthe distance-3 rotated surface code and its XZZX variant, using a logical qubit\ncoherence time metric based on Ramsey-like experiments. Our numerical results\nsuggest that quantum error correction converts non-Markovian physical noise\ninto Markovian logical noise, resulting in a quartic dependence of coherence\ntime between physical and logical qubits. Additionally, we analyze the effects\nof spatial noise correlations and sparse architectures, substantiating the\nrobustness of quantum error correction in silicon-based spin qubit systems."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "In recent years, various frameworks have been proposed for the study of\nquantum processes with indefinite causal order. In particular, quantum circuits\nwith quantum control of causal order (QC-QCs) form a broad class of physical\nsupermaps obtained from a bottom-up construction and are believed to represent\nall quantum processes physically realisable in a fixed spacetime.\nComplementarily, the formalism of routed quantum circuits introduces quantum\noperations constrained by \"routes\" to represent processes in terms of a more\nfine-grained routed circuit decomposition. This decomposition, formalised using\na so-called routed graph, represents the information flow within the respective\nprocess. However, the existence of routed circuit decompositions has only been\nestablished for a small set of processes so far, including both certain\nspecific QC-QCs and more exotic processes as examples.\n  In this work, we remedy this fact by connecting these two frameworks. We\nprove that for any given $N$, one can use a single routed graph to\nsystematically obtain a routed circuit decomposition for any QC-QC with $N$\nparties. We detail this construction explicitly and contrast it with other\nrouted circuit decompositions of QC-QCs, which we obtain from alternative\nrouted graphs. We conclude by pointing out how this connection can be useful to\ntackle various open problems in the field of indefinite causal order,\nparticularly establishing circuit representations of subclasses of QC-QCs."}

Although remarkable progress has been achieved in\ndeveloping quantum theories of nonlinear responses to electric field, a\ncomprehensive quantum theory framework that systematically addresses nonlinear\nresponses to both electric and magnetic fields has yet to be thoroughly\ndiscussed. Here, we present a systematic quantum theory of nonlinear\nelectromagnetic response using the Matsubara Green's function approach, which\nexplicitly incorporates the wave vector dependence of external electromagnetic\nfields. We provide diagrammatic representation and reveal the general\nproperties of transport coefficients. We apply our theory to second-order\nresponses, deriving the nonlinear Hall effects and magneto-nonlinear Hall\neffects in both time-reversal symmetric and time-reversal breaking systems.\nThese effects stem from diverse quantum geometric sources. Additionally, we\nanalyze the contributions arising from the Zeeman interaction.

To some extent, the structure resembles that of a\nfield-effect transistor with multiple controlling electrodes (gates).\nScalability is audible and it opens up a possibility of large-scale quantum\ncomputer fabricated by advanced silicon technology. Moreover, the structure\ncould be developed into an ensemble quantum register where instead of single\nnanowire an array of them with common controlling electrodes and contacts is\nfabricated. This ensemble register is much more resistant against environment\nnoise caused by phonons and stray charges due to averaging and compensation. It\nis crucial that an individual qubit consists of two DQDs. The basic states of\nthat qubit correspond to symmetric state of one DQD and antisymmetric state of\nanother, and vice versa. Then the quantum information can be encoded and\nprocessed without charge transfer between dots. The probability to find an\nelectron in a dot constantly equals 1/2 thus the Coulomb interaction between\nDQDs is also constant. Although the Coulomb interaction is incessant, the\nstrength of its action depends on mutual states of interacting DQDs\n(in-resonance or off-resonance). Therefore, a quantum algorithm could be\neffectuated via manipulation solely with steady and pulse gate potentials that\nreminds an operation of a digital integrated circuit. The final read-out of the\nregister is performed after decoding into charge states of DQDs and a\ntransmission of current through the wire."}

Using\npolarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we identified excitonic\ncomplexes and confirmed the presence of a negatively charged trion, exhibiting\na degree of circular polarization (DOCP) of $-36\\%$ under quasi--resonant\nexcitation. From the analysis of Hanle linewidth and employing a previously\nreported value of the electron $g$-factor, we extracted an electron spin\ndephasing time of $T_2^{\\ast} = 1.59 \\pm 0.49~\\mathrm{ns}$.
