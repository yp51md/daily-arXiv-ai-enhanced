More concretely, a metric network is a network whose edges are each assigned a notion of length and a coordinate describing position. One can then define function spaces and differential operators on these objects to model the aforementioned systems. Recent software advancements have made it feasible to analyze partial differential equations on large, compact metric networks with a vast array of structures. Here, we generate compact metric network structures using the spatial tessellations of two-dimensional hyperuniform point patterns, which have suppressed large-scale density fluctuations relative to typical disordered point patterns. This choice of structure is inspired by the exotic physical properties of network materials with these structures in other contexts. Then, we characterize the eigenvalue spectrum structure of the differential Laplace operator on these networks. In particular, we find that gaps can form in the eigenvalue spectra of these networks whose widths increase when the distribution of edge lengths is narrow and as the number of triangular faces increases. Importantly, many of the structures we consider are realizable in Euclidean space, meaning they are well-suited for practical applications in, e.g., metamaterial design. This work can thus be used to inform the design of metric network-based systems with spectral gaps with tunable widths and locations."}

Stealthy hyperuniform configurations are generated using generalized cost functions that interpolate between square-lattice-like and triangular-lattice-like arrangements. Using linear spin-wave theory for the mixed-spin model, we demonstrate that triangular-lattice-like arrangements yield a larger average staggered magnetization than both random and square-lattice-like cases. This enhancement originates from sublattice effects: while the square-lattice-like configuration enforces nearest-neighbor impurities to occupy opposite sublattices due to its bipartite structure, the triangular-lattice-like arrangement allows same-sublattice nearest-neighbor pairs, thereby strengthening cooperative magnetic enhancement."}

For this model, we prove that physical quantities on the Nishimori line (NL) can be expressed exactly in terms of those of the pure Ising model at an effective temperature on any lattice in any dimension. For example, the energy on the NL is equal to the energy of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature up to a constant and a trivial factor. More remarkably, the specific heat on the NL equals the energy, not the specific heat, of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature, again up to a constant and a trivial factor. Gauge-noninvariant quantities such as the magnetization and correlation functions are exactly equal to the corresponding quantities of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature. These exact relations imply that the leading critical behavior at that multicritical point for the disorder-correlated model is pure-Ising-like, in contrast to the conventional multicritical universality class of the standard Edwards-Anderson model. Our results motivate further investigations of the relatively unexplored topic of correlations in disorder in spin glasses and related problems."}

We here develop a principled understanding of the typical behavior of generalization in Neural Network Gaussian process regression dynamics. We derive a dynamical mean-field theory that captures the typical case learning dynamics: This allows us to unify multiple existing regimes of learning studied in the current literature, namely Bayesian inference on Gaussian processes, gradient flow with or without weight-decay, and stochastic Langevin training dynamics. Employing tools from statistical physics, the unified framework we derive in either of these cases yields an effective description of the high-dimensional microscopic behavior of networks dynamics in terms of lower dimensional order parameters. We show that collective training dynamics may be separated into the dynamics of N independent eigenmodes, those evolution equations are only coupled through collective response functions and a common statistics of an effective, independent noise. Our approach allows us to quantitatively explain the dynamics of the generalization error by linking spectral and dynamical properties of learning on data with power law spectra, including phenomena such as neural scaling laws and the effect of early stopping."}

We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions.

We define a measure of operator growth in terms of subsystem operator Rényi entropy, which provides a state-independent measure of operator growth, unlike entanglement entropies, and the usual measures of operator growth like out-of-time-order correlators. We show that the subsystem operator Rényi entropy encodes both spatial and temporal information, and thus can directly connect to transport for a local operator related to a conserved quantity. We construct a unified Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory formalism for the time evolution of operator Rényi entropy and entanglement entropies of initial pure states. We use the SK field theory to obtain the operator Rényi and state entanglement entropies in terms of infinite-temperature and vacuum Keldysh Green's functions, respectively, for non-interacting systems. We apply the method to explore the connection between operator and entanglement growth, and transport in non-interacting systems with quasiperiodic and random disorder, like the one- and two-dimensional Aubry-André models and the two-dimensional Anderson model.

A complementary understanding of the stability of the scars under different perturbations is obtained by analyzing the Loschmidt echo and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the scars. Finite-size scaling analysis of the QFI reveals that the scars are much more sensitive to perturbations as compared to the nearby thermal states.

We derive an approximate kinetic equation for mode populations that describes a continuous-time random walk in action space. The walk transition rates are defined by the overlap matrix encoding the spatial structure of eigenstates that can be computed exactly. Analyzing the spectral properties of the equation, we show that defect-induced localized modes act as bottlenecks that strongly slow down relaxation, with rates scaling as $ε^{-2}$ for strong defects. Using large-deviation theory, we characterize rare dynamical trajectories and identify distinct relaxation pathways associated with low- and high-activity regimes in action space. We provide numerical evidence that the large-deviation function exhibits a dynamical phase transition in the limit $ε\\to \\infty$. We then extend our analysis to the nonlinear case, considering a single nonlinear defect embedded in either a linear or a fully nonlinear discrete Schrödinger equation. Numerical simulations reveal a qualitatively faster approach to equilibrium driven by the amplitude-dependent weakening of the defect.

Using power-law interactions, recent state transfer protocols achieve speedup by utilizing the intermediate ancilla sites. However, these protocols require the ancillas to be in a perfectly initialized state, which, due to noise or imperfect control, may not be the case. In this work we introduce the $\\textit{robustness}$ of a state transfer protocol, which quantifies the protocol's tolerance to error in the initial ancilla state. In the Heisenberg picture, state transfer grows operators supported on the final site such that they no longer commute with all operators on the starting site. We prove that this robustness tightly bounds the Schatten $p$-norms of these commutators between initial and final-site operators. This generalizes the known cases of $p=\\infty$ and $p=2$, which govern completely state-dependent and state-independent state transfer respectively, demonstrating that intermediate values of $p$ govern partially state-dependent state transfer. In conjunction with existing power-law light cones, our result gives new minimum runtimes for partially state-dependent protocols which, in certain regimes, are parametrically better than existing bounds. We introduce new robust state transfer protocols, charting the landscape between complete state-dependence and state-independence."}

Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy on $β$-UTe$_3$ shows Fano resonances characteristic of the heavy fermion state, while our quasiparticle interference imaging reveals the disappearance of Fermi-level nesting and the appearance of flat bands. We extend the tritelluride tight-binding model to include Kondo coupling and quantify the Fermi surface reconstruction. Consistent with the destruction of nesting, we observe no CDW in $β$-UTe$_3$.

Interferometers with an embedded antidot are ideal for accessing the Zeno regime, where the bare tunneling rate of localized anyons is much lower than the measurement rate. The Zeno-suppressed tunneling rate of the trapped anyon depends on the braiding phase and the transmission of the quantum point contacts.

By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.

Finite-temperature initial states are generated with the Stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation, and the subsequent dynamics are evolved using the truncated Gross-Pitaevskii equation. To measure temperatures we use a momentum-space thermometry method that provides estimates for each condensate.

Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $θ$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(θ,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $θ$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $θ$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $θ$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection."}

Coherent transport is evaluated using wave-function matching within the Landauer-Büttiker formalism.

Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity."}

While feedback control is expected to further suppress fluctuations, its role within the TUR framework has remained unclear, particularly in quantum systems where control is inherently information-driven. In this Letter, we consider open quantum systems weakly coupled to a thermal environment, in which quantum jumps are continuously monitored, and Markovian feedback is applied. Using quantum mutual information to quantify the information contribution induced by feedback, we derive a finite-time TUR for arbitrary time-integrated currents in terms of entropy production and mutual information. Our results uncover how feedback control suppresses fluctuations together with thermodynamic cost and establishes a fundamental precision bound imposed by information-based control. As an application, we analyze a quantum clock model and demonstrate that the clock precision can be enhanced by feedback control in the presence of a single thermal reservoir."}

In multi-qubit systems, entanglement and magic are the key resources underlying genuinely quantum behaviour. While entanglement is well understood, magic -- essential for universal quantum computation -- remains relatively poorly characterised. Here we show that determining membership in the stabilizer polytope, which defines the free states of magic-state resource theory, requires super-exponential time $\\exp( n^2)$ in the number of qubits $n$, even approximately. We reduce the problem to solving a $3$-SAT instance on $n^2$ variables and, by invoking the exponential time hypothesis, the result follows. As a consequence, both quantifying and certifying magic are fundamentally intractable: any magic monotone for general states must be super-exponentially hard to compute, and deciding whether an operator is a valid magic witness is equally difficult. As a corollary, we establish the robustness of magic as computationally optimal among monotones. This barrier extends even to classically simulable regimes: deciding whether a state lies in the convex hull of states generated by a logarithmic number of non-Clifford gates is also super-exponentially hard. Together, these results reveal intrinsic computational limits on assessing classical simulability, distilling pathological magic states, and ultimately probing and exploiting magic as a quantum resource."}

We show that the subsystem operator Rényi entropy encodes both spatial and temporal information, and thus can directly connect to transport for a local operator related to a conserved quantity. We construct a unified Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory formalism for the time evolution of operator Rényi entropy and entanglement entropies of initial pure states.

The bath statistics acquire explicit dependence on the two-time autocorrelation function of the applied field, leading to drive-biased noise correlations and intrinsically non-Markovian dynamics. By eliminating the reservoir exactly at the operator level, we obtain a driven quantum generalized Langevin equation whose noise and dissipation kernels depend on two independent times.

Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $θ$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(θ,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $θ$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $θ$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $θ$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing.

We propose a novel method to detect this elusive order in quantum magnets with an illustration in the spin-1 triangular lattice Mott insulator. By integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom, we obtain a phase diagram with substantially enlarged regions for the spin-nematic and spin-nematic-supersolid phases. We then demonstrate that through the spin-lattice coupling, the emergence of spin nematic order imprints a distinctive signature onto the phonon spectra, providing a clear spectroscopic signature for the quadrupolar order accessible via Raman or inelastic X-ray scattering. Our formalism offers a direct and powerful method to uncover the hidden spin nematicity, opening a new pathway for diagnosing multipolar orders in quantum magnets."}

We then examine a broader family of quantum resource theories, where a distinct resource theory can be defined for each choice of reference pure state, establishing core resource-theoretic requirements without the computational shortcut offered by the \"grand sum\" employed in the original formulation of state texture. By extending from single \"resourceless\" states to convex sets via a convex-roof construction, we recover single-qubit measures of known resource theories such as imaginarity and coherence. Finally, we introduce a family of \"fixed-point resource theories\" that includes fixed-point instances of the theories of state texture, genuine coherence, purity, and athermality. For these fixed-point resource theories we show that, under free operations, the fidelity-based lower bound is weakly monotonic, while specific violations of strong monotonicity are found for the convex-roof logarithmic measure."}

In this work, we extend this analysis by including the interaction with a classical Newtonian potential. We show that, although the graviton bath alone dominates the mechanism for short times compared to a timescale established by the size of the quantum spatial superposition, the interplay between the gravitons and the internal degrees of freedom of the system renders decoherence inevitable in the long-time limit, even for microscopic masses. We also show that this mechanism is slightly slowed down by the interplay with the classical Newtonian potential, which, for systems without dynamical internal degrees of freedom, can even lead to recoherence, at least in principle."}

In the 1980s, Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin observed independently that computers based on quantum mechanics might enable better simulations of quantum phenomena. Their vision remained an intellectual curiosity until Peter Shor published his famous quantum algorithm for integer factoring, and shortly thereafter a proof that errors in quantum computations can be corrected. Since then, quantum computing R&D has progressed rapidly, from small-scale experiments in university physics laboratories to well-funded industrial efforts and prototypes. Hype notwithstanding, quantum computers have yet to solve scientifically or practically important problems -- a target often called quantum utility. In this article, we describe the capabilities of contemporary quantum computers, compare them to the requirements of quantum utility, and illustrate how to track progress from today to utility. We highlight key science and engineering challenges on the road to quantum utility, touching on relevant aspects of our own research."}

We show that this hierarchy ceases to be absolute in the multi-copy regime. Analyzing qubit spin observables, we prove a No-Comparison Theorem establishing that no global ordering of incompatible observable sets is preserved across all finite-copy configurations. In particular, two sets of observables can exhibit reversed complementarity ordering depending solely on whether the available resources are arranged as identical copies or as parallel-antiparallel pairs. Thus, the degree of quantum incompatibility is not an intrinsic property of observables alone but depends on the global configuration of the prepared quantum probes.

We analyze the latter through numerical simulations and find that anharmonicities of the potential wells can prevent maintaining the resonance condition throughout the cooling process and thus inhibit a significant reduction in motional energy. We propose a cooling scheme that sweeps the trapping frequency of the potential wells. We show that this scheme enables efficient cooling from cryogenic temperatures all the way to the quantum regime of motion.

Noise-Induced Barren Plateaus (NIBP) are particularly interesting, as they are predicted to arise due to noise accumulation independent of circuit structure. We experimentally study NIBP on IBM quantum hardware and demonstrate their absence under non-unital amplitude damping characterized by the qubit's $T_1$ coherence times. We use Information Content Landscape Analysis (ICLA) to efficiently estimate gradient norms for circuits ranging from 8 to 102 qubits, with hundreds of parameters and circuit runtimes of hundreds of microseconds. Classical simulations of the 8-qubit case under noiseless, depolarizing, amplitude damping, and dephasing noise models serve as a baseline comparison. We thoroughly analyze the experimental results considering calibration data, shot-noise, and circuit structure. We robustly observe that the gradient magnitude saturates beyond a characteristic circuit runtime, in contrast with the exponential decay expected from NIBP. Using recent theoretical results, we corroborate that under $T_1$-dominated noise NIBP do not occur and extract an effective $T_1^\\text{eff}$ that is significantly shorter than suggested by standard calibration data. Our results experimentally confirm recent predictions on the absence of NIBP under non-unital noise.

We implement a covariant SU(2) rotation and non-linear rotations by optical beams and achieve an averaged single-Clifford gate fidelity of $0.961_{-5}^{+5}$. The measurement of the coherence time and spin relaxation time shows that the idling error becomes increasingly biased toward dephasing errors as the magnitude of the encoded sublevel $|m_F|$ increases. Furthermore, we benchmark the noise bias of rank-preserving gates on spin-cat qubits, demonstrating a finite bias of $18_{-11}^{+132}$, in contrast to the case of the two-level system in ${}^{171}\\mathrm{Yb}$, which shows no bias within the experimental uncertainty. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of spin-cat qubits for realizing bias-tailored QECCs, paving the way for achieving hardware-efficient quantum error correction."}

In standard thermodynamic protocols involving system--bath interactions, the maximum work is given by the free-energy difference between the initial state and the corresponding Gibbs state at the bath temperature. This motivates a natural question: does information also limit work extraction in closed quantum systems that do not involve a heat bath and where work is obtained through unitary operations generated by a time-dependent Hamiltonian? While ergotropy quantifies the maximum work extractable via unitary operations, it assumes complete knowledge of the quantum state, typically requiring full state tomography. In realistic scenarios, however, only partial information is accessible. In this case, the relevant figure of merit is observational ergotropy, which depends explicitly on the measurement used to probe the system. We show that observational ergotropy decreases under classical post-processing of measurement outcomes, implying that fine-grained measurements allow greater work extraction than coarse-grained ones. Moreover, maximizing observational ergotropy over all possible measurements recovers standard ergotropy, which decomposes into incoherent (classical) and coherent (quantum) contributions. Our results demonstrate that coherence in the measurement projectors constitutes the key resource, enabling work extraction beyond the incoherent limit and establishing coherence as the origin of quantum advantage in observational ergotropy extraction."}

We employ a ring structured XY mixer that restricts the quantum evolution to the subspace of valid cut configurations, ensuring that all sampled states correspond to feasible solutions. To address scalability limitations, we suggest an iterative metaheuristic strategy that decomposes large instances into smaller subproblems solved sequentially using the same quantum model. The results obtained using the mixer indicate that the initial probability distribution can be systematically controlled, thereby enabling the development of warm start techniques within variational quantum based algorithms."}

In this service-oriented paradigm, quantum circuits, which constitute high-value intellectual property, are exposed to risks of unauthorized access, reuse, and misuse. Digital watermarking has been explored as a promising mechanism for protecting quantum circuits by embedding ownership information for tracing and verification. However, driven by recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, the paradigm of quantum circuit design is shifting from individually and manually constructed circuits to automated synthesis based on quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs). In such generative settings, protecting only individual output circuits is insufficient, and existing post hoc, circuit-centric watermarking methods are not designed to integrate with the generative process, often failing to simultaneously ensure stealthiness, functional correctness, and robustness at scale. These limitations highlight the need for a new watermarking paradigm that is natively integrated with quantum circuit generative models. In this work, we present the first watermarking framework for QCGMs, which embeds ownership signals into the generation process while preserving circuit fidelity. We introduce a symmetric sampling strategy that aligns watermark encoding with the model's Gaussian prior, and a synchronization mechanism that counteracts adversarial watermark attack through latent drift correction. Empirical results confirm that our method achieves high-fidelity circuit generation and robust watermark detection across a range of perturbations, paving the way for scalable, secure copyright protection in AI-powered quantum design."}

Their performance is commonly quantified by three metrics: pair-collection probability, heralding efficiency, and spectral purity. In bulk-crystal SPDC, these metrics are known to be mutually constrained, yet the physical origin of the resulting trade-offs is often obscured. We show that these trade-offs originate from the frequency-dependent population of discrete spatial modes in the SPDC emission. By performing a Laguerre-Gauss mode decomposition at each frequency component, we show how spectral-spatial non-separability impacts collection probability, heralding efficiency, and purity. We apply this framework to two widely used quasi-phase-matching configurations: collinear degenerate type-0 and type-II SPDC in periodically poled bulk crystals, and quantify how different phase-matching functions shape the spectral-spatial mode structure. In particular, for type-II SPDC we compare standard periodically poled and aperiodically poled Gaussian phase matching. We experimentally validate some of our theoretical results using spatial- and spectral-projection measurements. This spectral-spatial mode analysis provides a quantitative and predictive framework for understanding and engineering bulk-crystal photon sources, enabling systematic multi-parameter optimization beyond qualitative design guidelines."}

Drawing a direct analogy between classical wave optics and quantum state evolution in a bosonic mode, we construct a confocal system with two Fock-space lenses. The first lens deterministically focuses a coherent state into a quantum probe with a tightly concentrated photon-number distribution, while the second lens maps the metrological information back to the vacuum state for efficient readout.

For unmonitored noise or inefficient detection, the QFI of the detectable part of the environment may be obtained from a recently derived GME acting on multiple system replicas. Tilted master equations provide the full counting statistics of quantum jumps and diffusive measurements, enabling, e.g., studies of quantum thermodynamics beyond average values. Here we focus on bosonic linear systems, governed by a quadratic Hamiltonian and linear jump operators, whose dynamics preserves Gaussianity. For Gaussian initial states, we recast a generic GME as a compact set of ordinary differential equations for the covariance matrix (a Riccati-type equation), first moments, and normalization. These equations can be integrated efficiently without Hilbert-space truncation, and admit analytical results in simple settings. We also provide specialized forms for fidelity/QFI and full counting statistics.

Signatures of both are currently pursued in quantum-simulator experiments, opening a new angle on strongly interacting dynamics of gauge fields out of equilibrium, complementary to traditional particle-physics settings. In this work, we report the emergence of metastable confinement dynamics in a U(1) lattice gauge theory, originating from the competition between string tension and four-Fermi coupling - a competition that naturally arises in Rydberg atom arrays. We show that the initial string state can be resonantly melted through controlled energy matching, a phenomenon we identify as resonant string breaking. We demonstrate this mechanism for both static and Floquet-driven systems, where periodic modulation generates a spectrum of tunable sideband resonances. Our work provides new insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking driven by long-range interactions and time-dependent fields, which are available in current quantum simulators on a variety of platforms."}

We use gauge invariance and the Pauli principle to establish constraints on the spin-dependent density-density correlations that are consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation and Wick's theorem. As an example, we study the spin-dependent density-density correlations from the BCS to the Bose regime in two dimensions at zero temperature, inspired by experiments in 6Li. We show that two-particle irreducible contributions involving collective excitations, many-particle scattering and vertex corrections, are essential to describe experiments. In particular they turn out to be responsible for the emergence of an experimentally observed minimum in the opposite-spin density-density correlations."}

Thereby, we focus on two electron-pump setups where lowest-order tunneling processes are suppressed and the pump is exclusively driven by modulations of the coupling energy. The first setup is driven by switching on and off the couplings between the quantum dot and the leads, while the second setup employs measurements of the dot occupation. We derive exact solutions for arbitrarily strong tunnel couplings in the absence of Coulomb interaction, identify parameter regimes with optimal pumping currents or optimal energy efficiency, and discuss similarities between both pumping mechanisms."}

By incorporating the quantum-classical-transfer entropy, which quantifies the information gained by continuous measurement, we show that the precision of currents is constrained by information-thermodynamic costs such as the entropy production and information gain. Our result shows that information gain has the potential to enhance the precision of currents beyond the bounds set by the conventional TUR. We illustrate the bound with a driven two-level system under continuous measurement and feedback, demonstrating that feedback achieves higher precision of currents while suppressing the entropy production."}

A MFEL is characterized by a radially symmetric, spatially varying refractive index with the remarkable property that rays emitted from any point within the lens are perfectly focused at their image points. While the implementation of such gradient-index lenses is challenging in conventional optical systems, BECs offer a highly tunable platform in which the spatially varying speed of sound of collective excitations -- phonons, the acoustic-wave analogues of photons -- can be engineered and their dynamics observed in real time. Time-resolved measurements of phonon wavefronts reveal focusing behavior that shows good agreement with analytical theory and numerical simulations. This work provides both a geometric and physical framework for engineering effective refractive indices using ultracold atoms, and simulating wave propagation on effective spherical geometries."}
