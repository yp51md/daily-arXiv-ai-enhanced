Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子电池（QB）是一种新型能量存储和转换设备，通过调整量子充电器的本征频率，可以实现充电状态的开关和无损功率检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用量子纠缠资源提升量子电池的充电效率，并实现充电状态的灵活控制和无损监测。

Method: 提出一种基于量子比特充电器和腔体存储器的QB配置，通过调整充电器的本征频率实现充电开关，并通过外部电磁波散射谱无损监测存储能量。

Result: 该QB能够直接存储相干态能量（而非单光子态），具有显著的高功容量，并通过实验电路量子电动力学设备验证了其可行性。

Conclusion: 提出的开关式QB配置为量子能量存储和转换提供了新的实验实现途径，具有潜在的高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is a conceptually new energy storage and conversion
device, which consists usually of a quantum charger and an energy store (called
usually as the QB for simplicity). The demonstrated advantage of QB, over its
classical counterpart, is that its charging efficiency can be significantly
enhanced by using quantum entanglement resources. In this letter, we
investigate alternatively how to realize the switchable charging and the
lossless power detection of the charged QB. With the proposed QB configuration
we show that, by adjusting the eigenfrequency of the qubit-based charger, the
cavity-based QB can be switched on between the charging and power-off states
and its stored energy can be non-destructively monitored by probing the
transmitted spectrum of the external electromagnetic waves scattered by the
qubit-based charger. As the qubit-based charger has never been excited, the
proposed cavity-based QB could directly store the coherent state energy (rather
than the single-photon one) and thus possess significantly large ergotropy. The
physical realization of the proposed switchable QB configuration is
demonstrated specifically with the experimental circuit quantum
electrodynamical devices.

Conclusion: 该协议为高效量子过程层析提供了新途径，尤其适用于包含固定数量非克利福德门的量子通道。

Abstract: We present a quantum process tomography protocol based on a low-degree ansatz
for the quantum channel, i.e. when it can be expressed as a fixed-degree
polynomial in terms of Pauli operators. We demonstrate how to perform
tomography of such channels with a polynomial amount of effort relative to the
size of the system, by employing random state preparation and measurements in
the Pauli basis. We extend the applicability of the protocol to channels
consisting of a layer of quantum gates with a fixed number of non-Clifford
gates, followed by a low-degree noise channel. Rather than inverting the layer
of quantum gates in the hardware, which would introduce new errors, we
effectively carry out the inversion by classical post-processing while
maintaining the protocol's efficiency. Numerical simulations support our
theoretical findings and demonstrate the feasibility of our method.

Motivation: 为了更好地理解开放量子系统中的对称性和相位等价性，尤其是对于具有非平凡拓扑简并性的系统。

Method: 通过局部可逆通道电路分析混合态相位等价性，并研究其对对称性和拓扑性质的影响。

Result: 证明了局部可逆通道能保持拓扑简并性和对称性，且二维经典环系在传统定义下平凡，但在新定义下非平凡。

Conclusion: 新定义揭示了传统定义未能捕捉的非平凡拓扑性质，为开放量子系统的相位分类提供了更全面的框架。

Abstract: We propose a refined definition of mixed-state phase equivalence based on
locally reversible channel circuits. We show that such circuits preserve
topological degeneracy and the locality of all operators including both strong
and weak symmetries. Under a locally reversible channel, weak unitary
symmetries are locally dressed into channel symmetries, a new generalization of
symmetry for open quantum systems. For abelian higher-form symmetries, we show
the refined definition preserves anomalies and spontaneous breaking of such
symmetries within a phase. As a primary example, a two-dimensional classical
loop ensemble is trivial under the previously adopted definition of mixed-state
phases. However, it has non-trivial topological degeneracy arising from a
mutual anomaly between strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and our results show
that it is not connected to a trivial state via locally reversible channel
circuits.

Conclusion: 该工作为开发非厄米系统中的选择性体-边界控制机制奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of complex spectra in non-Hermitian systems causes dramatic
changes even under weak perturbations, significantly hindering their precise
control for study and integration into practical applications. Achieving a
controlled method to generate a real spectrum in non-Hermitian systems has long
been a key objective in the field. In this study, we explore the 2D
non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and introduce a reality switch
that allows for the controllable induction of a real spectrum depending on the
imposed boundary condition. We show that a topological phase transition in the
complex gap accompanies the switching process. Our work lays the cornerstone
for developing a selective bulk-boundary control mechanism for the gain and
lasing behaviors in non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics have become a central research focus, exemplified by
the counterintuitive Mpemba effect where initially hotter systems can cool
faster than colder ones. Studied extensively in both classical and quantum
regimes, this phenomenon reveals diverse and complex behaviors across different
systems. This review provides a concise overview of the quantum Mpemba effect
(QME), specifically emphasizing its connection to symmetry breaking and
restoration in closed quantum many-body systems. We begin by outlining the
classical Mpemba effect and its quantum counterparts, summarizing key findings.
Subsequently, we introduce entanglement asymmetry and charge variance as key
metrics for probing the QME from symmetry perspectives. Leveraging these tools,
we analyze the early- and late-time dynamics of these quantities under
Hamiltonian evolution and random unitary circuits. We conclude by discussing
significant challenges and promising avenues for future research.

### [6] [Scaling Quantum Algorithms via Dissipation: Avoiding Barren Plateaus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02043)
*Elias Zapusek,Ivan Rojkov,Florentin Reiter*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 变分量子算法（VQAs）在近期量子设备上有广泛应用，但受限于贫瘠高原问题。耗散量子算法通过非幺正动力学避免贫瘠高原，具有噪声鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决变分量子算法中贫瘠高原和噪声导致的优化困难问题。

Method: 提出基于非幺正通道的耗散量子算法，通过周期性重置辅助量子比特提取熵。

Result: 理论分析和数值模拟表明，耗散算法在噪声环境下仍可训练，优于传统VQAs。

Conclusion: 耗散量子算法是传统VQAs的可扩展、抗噪声替代方案。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have enabled a wide range of
applications on near-term quantum devices. However, their scalability is
fundamentally limited by barren plateaus, where the probability of encountering
large gradients vanishes exponentially with system size. In addition, noise
induces barren plateaus, deterministically flattening the cost landscape.
Dissipative quantum algorithms that leverage nonunitary dynamics to prepare
quantum states via engineered cooling offer a complementary framework with
remarkable robustness to noise. We demonstrate that dissipative quantum
algorithms based on non-unital channels can avoid both unitary and
noise-induced barren plateaus. Periodically resetting ancillary qubits actively
extracts entropy from the system, maintaining gradient magnitudes and enabling
scalable optimization. We provide analytic conditions ensuring they remain
trainable even in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations confirm our
predictions and illustrate scenarios where unitary algorithms fail but
dissipative algorithms succeed. Our framework positions dissipative quantum
algorithms as a scalable, noise-resilient alternative to traditional VQAs.

Result: 识别出噪声增强估计的特定场景，并通过量子比特和光子传感器网络验证了改进的时间间隔或全局场传感协议。

Conclusion: 非相干动力学可以作为计量资源，在某些情况下提升量子传感的精度。

Abstract: I show that incoherent dynamics can lead to metrological advantages in
quantum sensing. The results rely on the fact that incoherent dynamics lead to
an additive contribution to the quantum Fisher information about time. Such an
additive contribution can lead to a decrease in the error of optimal estimation
protocols, as implied by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. I characterize regimes
in which the estimation of a time interval or a frequency is enhanced by noise,
thus identifying cases where incoherent dynamics serve as a metrological
resource. I illustrate with protocols that display improved sensing of time
intervals or global fields by qubit and photonic sensor networks.

Method: 提出选择性特征重编码策略和并行模式QCNN架构，结合PCA和自动编码器的特征提取方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MNIST和Fashion MNIST数据集上显著提升了分类准确率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 选择性特征重编码和并行QCNN架构为量子机器学习在图像分类中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.

ps optical pulses using non-linear photonics. We demonstrate single photon
production through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurement for one to six ions.

### [10] [Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02828)
*Yuzhen Zhang,Sagar Vijay,Yingfei Gu,Yimu Bao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which
Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of
non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize
approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We
prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth
circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs
with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions
on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and
$O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas,
which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our
construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with
strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically
reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an
example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$
single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an
additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics
description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative
understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for
additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various
architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.

Conclusion: 本征态能够编码量子混沌的完整时空解剖结构，为理解信息扰动提供了新视角。

Abstract: How are the spatial and temporal patterns of information scrambling in
locally interacting quantum many-body systems imprinted on the eigenstates of
the system's time-evolution operator? We address this question by identifying
statistical correlations among sets of minimally four eigenstates that provide
a unified framework for various measures of information scrambling. These
include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the
time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as
two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We
demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate
correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary
circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the
information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the
lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can
encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the
descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation
hypothesis.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了热波动对卡西米尔扭矩的重要影响，为设计基于卡西米尔扭矩的纳米器件提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Casimir effect, originating from quantum and thermal fluctuations, is
well known for inducing forces between closely spaced surfaces. When these
surfaces are optically anisotropic, these interactions can produce a Casimir
torque that rotates the surfaces relative to each other. We investigate, for
the first time, the influence of thermal fluctuations on the Casimir torque
between birefringent plates. Our results reveal that thermal modes
significantly diminish the torque, with reductions up to 2 orders of magnitude
for highly birefringent materials. Temperature is also shown to alter the
angular dependence of the torque, significantly deviating from the typical
sinusoidal behavior, and becomes particularly important at large separations
that exceed the thermal wavelength. Finally, we demonstrate that systems of
dissimilar birefringent plates that exhibit a distance-dependent reversal in
the torque's direction can enable precise control of the torque's magnitude and
sign through temperature manipulation. These findings advance our understanding
of quantum and thermal fluctuation interplay and provide a framework for
designing innovative nanoscale sensors and devices leveraging Casimir torque
phenomena.

Abstract: We prove that every 5-qubit absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state is
equivalent by a local unitary transformation to a point in the unique ((5,2,3))
quantum error correcting code C. Furthermore, two points in C are equivalent if
and only if they are related by a group of order 24 acting on C. There exists a
set of 3 invariant polynomials that separates equivalence classes of 5-qubit
AME states. We also show that every 4-qubit pure code is equivalent to a
subspace of the unique ((4,4,2)) and construct an infinite family of 3-uniform
n-qubit states for even $n\geq 6$. The proofs rely heavily on results from
Vinberg and classical invariant theory.

Conclusion: 纠缠群为混态的纠缠提供了新的操作表征，并揭示了其与纯化态的联系。

Abstract: We extend an operational characterization of entanglement in terms of
stabilizer groups from pure states to mixed states. For a density matrix
$\rho_{AB}$, a stabilizer is a factorized unitary matrix $u_A \otimes u_B$
that, under conjugation, leaves $\rho_{AB}$ invariant. The entanglement group
is a quotient of the stabilizer group, in which one-party stabilizers are
considered trivial. This definition relates the entanglement of a density
matrix to the entanglement of its purification. We give general properties of
entanglement groups for mixed states, then discuss special properties for
separable states. For a separable state, the entanglement group may be
non-trivial. However it can only arise from multi-party entanglement with the
purifying system.

Abstract: We present a method characterizing thermal noise in an optical cavity
independent from quantum noise despite the thermal noise falling below the
quantum noise limit. Using this method, we measured the thermal noise
contribution from a GaAs AlGaAs micro-mirror suspended on a GaAs cantilever
microresonator when brought to a cryogenic temperature (approximately 25 K) and
incorporated into a Fabry Perot cavity. An optical spring is formed in this
optical cavity. Previously, this setup exploited an optical spring to produce a
displacement sensitivity falling 2.8 dB below the free-mass standard quantum
limit (SQL), as reported by Cullen et. al. Here we use a similar setup to
measure thermal noise which fell a maximum of 5 dB below the SQL. This
measurement, in turn, allowed for an investigation of quantum noise suppression
resulting from the optical spring effect, falling a maximum of 10 dB below the
SQL.

probabilistic procedure for preparing SC states using degenerate spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with depleting pump mode and subsequent

theory -- fully theoretical understanding of SPDC with depleting pump mode,
which is currently was not provided in quantum domain. We also report that
even-photon measurement also allows obtaining SC states, albeit less bright.

Abstract: A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment
shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian
counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 223601 (2022)].
In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering
states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian
single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the
scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic
limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger
equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states
are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in
Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite
localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and
discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find
the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional
next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.

Abstract: Initialization of mechanical modes in the quantum ground state is crucial for
their use in quantum information and quantum sensing protocols. In quantum
processors, impurity of the modes' initial state affects the infidelity of
subsequent quantum algorithms. In quantum sensors, excitations out of the
ground state contribute to the noise of the detector, and their prevalence puts
a bound on rare events that deposit energy into the mechanical modes. In this
work, we measure the excited-state populations of GHz-frequency modes in a
high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR). We find that the population
of the first excited state can be as low as $P_p$=(1.2$\pm$5.5)$\times10^{-5}$,
corresponding to an effective temperature of 25.2 mK, which are upper bounds
limited by imperfections in the measurement process. These results compare
favorably to the lowest populations measured in superconducting circuits.
Finally, we use the measured populations to constrain the amplitude of
high-frequency gravitational waves, the kinetic mixing strength of ultra-light
dark matter, and non-linear modifications of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
describing wavefunction collapse mechanisms. Our work establishes HBARs as a
versatile resource for quantum state initialization and studies of fundamental
physics.

### [19] [Bias-tailored single-shot quantum LDPC codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02239)
*Shixin Wu,Todd A. Brun,Daniel A. Lidar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合偏置定制和单次纠错的量子代码层次结构，通过优化硬件开销和噪声类型适应，提升了纠错效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子硬件中比特翻转（X）和相位翻转（Z）错误通常不平衡，现有纠错代码未能充分利用这种偏置。同时，单次纠错技术可以避免重复测量，提高效率。

Method: 从症状编码的超图积代码出发，针对主导错误类型进行定制化设计，生成新的量子代码。通过裁剪稳定器块，得到简化版和缩减版代码，分别优化硬件开销和噪声适应性。

Result: 简化版代码减少了物理量子比特数量和稳定器测量次数，同时最小距离呈二次增长；缩减版代码在纯X或Z噪声下牺牲单次纠错保护，但在平衡噪声下仍保持单次纠错能力。

Conclusion: 这些偏置定制的单次纠错代码为量子纠错提供了灵活的设计选择，允许在硬件开销和噪声类型之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Quantum hardware rarely suffers equal amounts of bit-flip ($X$) and
phase-flip ($Z$) errors; one type is often much more common than the other. A
code that is ``bias-tailored'' can exploit this imbalance, lowering the
fault-tolerance overhead. A complementary idea, called "single-shot" error
correction, aims to recover from data errors and noisy measurements in a single
round of stabilizer readout, avoiding slow repetition cycles. In this work, we
combine these two ideas and build a hierarchy of new quantum codes.
  The full construction starts from the syndrome-encoded hypergraph product
code and then tailors it to the dominant error type. The resulting code keeps
the single-shot guarantee for every noise model while boosting the threshold
whenever $X$ and $Z$ errors are asymmetric.
  By removing carefully chosen blocks of stabilizers we obtain two trimmed
variants. The first, called the simplified code, cuts the physical-qubit count
by $1/6$ and halves the number of stabilizer measurements, yet its minimum
distance grows quadratically compared to the standard design and its biased
noise threshold is unchanged. The second, called the reduced code, achieves the
same hardware savings but trades away single-shot protection for purely $X$ or
purely $Z$ noise; instead it remains single-shot under balanced, or
depolarizing, noise. In settings where strongly biased noise is likely, either
trimmed code offers a less resource-intensive alternative to the full
construction.
  As a concrete illustration, we lift the two-dimensional XZZX surface code to
a three-dimensional cubic lattice and show that this ``3D XZZX'' code is an
explicit member of the simplified family.
  Taken together, these bias-tailored single-shot codes provide an adjustable
set of code design alternatives, allowing tradeoffs between hardware overhead
and noise types.

Abstract: Quantum lock-in amplification raises the detection sensitivity of magnetic
fields to unprecedented level by phase-locked pumping the Zeeman levels of a
single trapped atom. To further enhance this sensitivity, quadrature squeezing
could be introduced to overcome the quantum uncertainty limit. We propose a
detection scheme using an atomic ensemble whose collected spin is pumped by two
lasers for simultaneous squeezing and phase locking. We derive the optimal
$\pi/2$-pulse and $\pi$-pulse schemes that accomplishes this concurrent action
and prove that the resulting phase sensitivity is enhanced while the usable
detection window for phase locking is widened.

Abstract: The realization of a global quantum network holds the potential to enable
groundbreaking applications such as secure quantum communication and blind
quantum computing. However, building such a network remains a formidable
challenge, primarily due to photon loss in optical fibers. In this work, we
propose a quantum repeater architecture for distributing entanglement over
intercontinental distances by leveraging low-Earth-orbit satellites equipped
with spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon-pair sources and
ground stations utilizing single-atom memories in optical cavities and
single-photon detectors to implement the cavity-assisted photon scattering
(CAPS) gates for high-fidelity entanglement mapping. The efficient entanglement
swapping is achieved by performing high-fidelity Rydberg gates and readouts. We
evaluate the entanglement distribution rates and fidelities by analyzing
several key imperfections, including time-dependent two-photon transmission and
time-dependent pair fidelity, for various satellite heights and ground station
distances. We also investigate the impact of pair source fidelity and spin
decoherence rate on the repeater performance. Furthermore, we introduce a
spatial-frequency multiplexing strategy within this architecture to enhance the
design's performance. Finally, we discuss in detail the practical
implementation of this architecture. Our results show that this architecture
enables entanglement distribution over intercontinental distances. For example,
it can distribute over 10000 pairs per flyby over 10000 km with a fidelity
above 90%, surpassing the capabilities of terrestrial quantum repeaters

Motivation: 为一般读者提供对两量子比特态可分离概率8/33的详细推导，揭示其背后的几何与概率结构。

Method: 通过计算Hilbert-Schmidt体积（量子态空间、旗流形、正则共伴轨道），并将其与辛体积联系，利用Duistermaat-Heckman测度，综合体积比验证概率。

Result: 成功推导并验证了两量子比特态的可分离概率为8/33。

Conclusion: 通过几何与概率的紧密结合，为量子态可分离性研究提供了透明且严谨的方法。

Abstract: While the exact separability probability of 8/33 for two-qubit states under
the Hilbert-Schmidt measure has been reported by Huong and Khoi
[\href{https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad8493}{J.Phys.A:Math.Theor.{\bf57},
445304(2024)}], detailed derivations remain inaccessible for general audiences.
This paper provides a comprehensive, self-contained derivation of this result,
elucidating the underlying geometric and probabilistic structures. We achieve
this by developing a framework centered on the computation of Hilbert-Schmidt
volumes for key components: the quantum state space, relevant flag manifolds,
and regular (co)adjoint orbits. Crucially, we establish and leverage the
connection between these Hilbert-Schmidt volumes and the symplectic volumes of
the corresponding regular co-adjoint orbits, formalized through the
Duistermaat-Heckman measure. By meticulously synthesizing these volume
computations -- specifically, the ratios defining the relevant probability
measures -- we reconstruct and rigorously verify the 8/33 separability
probability. Our approach offers a transparent pathway to this fundamental
constant, detailing the interplay between symplectic geometry, representation
theory, and quantum probability.

Motivation: 旨在构建一种灵活的、可调的正交基函数框架，以超越传统变换（如傅里叶变换和沃尔什-哈达玛变换）的限制，并在量子计算中实现更高效的数据处理和信号分析。

Method: 通过$n$重张量积构造GTT，提出快速经典算法（复杂度$O(N \log_b N)$）和量子算法（复杂度$O(\log_b N)$），并应用于量子状态压缩、函数编码和数字信号处理。

Result: GTT在量子状态压缩和函数编码中表现出更高的保真度和更少的保留成分需求，同时在经典和量子信号滤波算法中展示了新颖性。

Conclusion: GTT框架为量子计算提供了灵活且高效的变换工具，显著优于传统方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Generalized Tensor Transforms (GTTs),
constructed through an $n$-fold tensor product of an arbitrary $b \times b$
unitary matrix $W$. This construction generalizes many established transforms,
by providing a adaptable set of orthonormal basis functions. Our proposed fast
classical algorithm for GTT achieves an exponentially lower complexity of $O(N
\log_b N)$ in comparison to a naive classical implementation that has an
associated computational cost of $O(N^2)$. For quantum applications, our
GTT-based algorithm, implemented in the natural spectral ordering, achieves
both gate complexity and circuit depth of $O(\log_b N)$, where $N = b^n$
denotes the length of the input vector. This represents a quadratic improvement
over Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which requires $O((\log_b N)^2)$ gates
and depth for $n$ qudits, and an exponential advantage over classical Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) based and Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) based
methods, which incur a computational cost of $O(N \log_b N)$.
  We explore diverse applications of GTTs in quantum computing, including
quantum state compression and transmission, function encoding and quantum
digital signal processing. The proposed framework provides fine-grained control
of the transformation through the adjustable parameters of the base matrix $W$.
This versatility allows precise shaping of each basis function while preserving
their effective Walsh-type structure, thus tailoring basis representations to
specific quantum data and computational tasks. Our numerical results
demonstrate that GTTs enable improved performance in quantum state compression
and function encoding compared to fixed transforms (such as FWHT or FFT),
achieving higher fidelities with fewer retained components. We also provided
novel classical and quantum digital signal filtering algorithms based on our
GTT framework.

Result: 新提出的修改硬币算子是唯一能成功搜索所有“例外配置”和非“例外配置”的算子。

Conclusion: “例外配置”的存在并非量子现象，而是某些硬币算子的局限性。

Abstract: There exist two types of configurations of marked vertices on a
two-dimensional grid, known as the {\it exceptional configurations}, which are
hard to find by the discrete-time quantum walk algorithms. In this article, we
provide a comparative study of the quantum walk algorithm with different coins
to search these {\it exceptional configurations} on a two-dimensional grid. We
further extend the analysis to the hypercube, where only one type of {\it
exceptional configurations} are present. Our observation, backed by numerical
results, is that our recently proposed modified coin operator is the only coin
which can search both types of {\it exceptional configurations} as well as
non-{\it exceptional configurations} successfully. As a consequence, we observe
that the existence of {\it exceptional configurations} are not a quantum
phenomenon, rather a mere limitation of some of the coin operators.

Abstract: We theoretically propose a scheme to enhance the photon indistinguishability
of spectrally mismatched single photons via Floquet-engineered optical

periodically modulating two distinct single-photon states under a modulation
frequency which is exactly equal to the spectral mismatch of two cavity modes,
a pair of single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) states is prepared
energy-conservatively based on full unitary operations. The two states show
high indistinguishability with an ideal $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{HOM}(0)$ down to zero
due to the superposition of intensity-matched single-photon states coherently
distributed across the teeth of the combs.

Conclusion: 量子计算为知识图谱嵌入提供了显著的速度优势，尤其是在大规模数据集上。

Abstract: Embedding of a knowledge graph(KG) entities and relations in the form of
vectors is an important aspect for the manipulation of the KG database for
several downstream tasks, such as link prediction, knowledge graph completion,
and recommendation. Because of the growing size of the knowledge graph
databases, it has become a daunting task for the classical computer to train a
model efficiently. Quantum computer can help speedup the embedding process of
the KGs by encoding the entities into a variational quantum circuit of
polynomial depth. Usually, the time complexity for such variational
circuit-dependent quantum classical algorithms for each epoch is $\mathcal{O}(N
\mbox{poly}(\log M))$, where $N$ is number of elements in the knowledge graph
and $M$ is the number of features of each entities of the knowledge graph. In
this article we exploit additional quantum advantage by training multiple
elements of KG in superpositions, thereby reducing the computing time further
for the knowledge graph embedding model.

Conclusion: 维度限制的非局域性为量子通信提供了新的资源，即使在没有纠缠认证的情况下也能实现安全密钥分发。

Abstract: With a measure of dimensionally restricted nonlocality in the bipartite Bell
scenario with two inputs and two outputs, a different decomposition of any
nonsignaling box that is a convex mixture of a single Popescu-Rohrlich box and
a Bell-local box, with the measure being zero, is introduced. It is shown that
any nonsignaling box shared by Alice and Bob that has dimensionally restricted
nonlocality contains secret correlations against any third party, Eve, who is
also dimensionally restricted. In this context, for the specific Bell scenario
considered, it is demonstrated that the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction can be
used as a resource for secure quantum key distribution even if entanglement is
not certified.

Conclusion: 研究阐明了退相干如何同时加速和限制信息获取，为开放量子系统的动力学提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We derive a new quantum speed limit (QSL) for open quantum systems governed
by Markovian dynamics. By analyzing the time derivative of the Bures angle
between the initial pure state and its time-evolved state, we obtain an
analytically computable upper bound on the evolution speed that decomposes into
three distinct physical contributions; coherent unitary dynamics, dissipative
deformation, and a fluctuation term. Based on this structure, we establish a
general inequality that connects the QSL to the Quantum Fisher information in
the short-time regime. This result gives a fundamental trade-off between the
distinguishability between speed and estimation precision, and clarifies how
decoherence can both accelerate and constrain information acquisition.

Conclusion: 该方法为多量子比特控制操作提供了可行方案，有望推动量子计算的发展。

Abstract: We propose a protocol for realizing a Toffoli gate using neutral-atom qubits
in optical tweezers. Two ground-state hyperfine levels of the atoms are
considered as qubit states. Our method relies on the strong and long-range
interactions between atoms due to Rydberg excitations and the occurrence of
dark states in the target qubit, with both control and target qubits being
individually addressed with laser pulses. Our gate protocol enables precise
control over the quantum states of individual qubits, effectively suppressing
undesirable transitions to ensure high-fidelity gate performance. The gate
fidelity is estimated to be about $96\%$ for realistic system parameters. We
further demonstrate a C$^\text{n}$NOT gate with $n >2$ by exploiting the
Rydberg antiblockade mechanism, which allows multiple atoms within the blockade
radius to be simultaneously excited to the Rydberg states. Thus, our approach
may open a promising route to multi-qubit controlled operations for quantum
computation.

Result: 算法适用于所有整数α>1，并在量子比特上进行了基准测试，资源需求优于其他已知算法。

Conclusion: 该算法不仅高效测量非稳定性，还揭示了非稳定性与纠缠之间的新关系。

Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, or magic, is a resource for universal quantum computation
in most fault-tolerant architectures; access to states with non-stabilizerness
allows for non-classically simulable quantum computation to be performed.
Quantifying this resource for unknown states is therefore essential to
assessing their utility in quantum computation. The Stabilizer R\'enyi
Entropies have emerged as a leading tools for achieving this, having already
enabled one efficient algorithm for measuring non-stabilizerness. In addition,
the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies have proven useful in developing connections
between non-stabilizerness and other quantum phenomena. In this work, we
introduced an alternative algorithm for measuring the Stabilizer R\'enyi
Entropies of an unknown quantum state. Firstly, we show the existence of a
state, produced from the action of a channel on $\alpha$ copies of some pure
state, that encodes the $\alpha$-Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy into its purity. We
detail several methods of applying this channel and then, by employing existing
purity-measuring algorithms, provide an algorithm for measuring the
$\alpha$-Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies for all integers $\alpha>1$. This
algorithm is benchmarked for qubits and the resource requirements compared to
other known algorithms. Finally, a non-stabilizerness/entanglement relationship
is shown to exist in the algorithm, demonstrating an novel relationship between
the two resources.

Conclusion: 研究为开发上下文感知的GST提供了新思路，可能适用于其他可微观建模的平台。

Abstract: To progress in the characterization of noise for current quantum computers,
gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a self-consistent tomographic protocol
that can accurately estimate the complete set of noisy quantum gates, state
preparations, and measurements. In its original incarnation, GST improves the
estimation precision by applying the gates sequentially, provided that the
noise makes them a set of fixed completely-positive and trace preserving (CPTP)
maps independent of the history of previous gates in the sequence. This
'Markovian' assumption is sometimes in conflict with experimental evidence, as
there might be time-correlated noise leading to non-Markovian dynamics or,
alternatively, slow drifts and cumulative calibration errors that lead to
context dependence, such that the CP-divisible maps composed during a sequence
actually change with the circuit depth. In this work, we address this issue for
trapped-ion devices with phonon-mediated two-qubit gates. By a detailed
microscopic modeling of high-fidelity light-shift gates, we tailor GST to
capture the main source of context dependence: motional degrees of freedom.
Rather than invalidating GST, we show that context dependence can be
incorporated in the parametrization of the gate set, allowing us to reduce the
sampling cost of GST. Our results identify a promising research avenue that
might be applicable to other platforms where microscopic modeling can be
incorporated: the development of a context-aware GST.

Abstract: Steady-state coherence in open quantum systems is crucial for quantum
technologies, yet its behavior is not fully understood due to the interplay
between collective and individual decoherence. While collective decoherence is
thought to induce steady-state coherence, experiments often fail to observe
this because of individual decoherence. We study a system of two harmonic
oscillators coupled to both individual and collective environments, introducing
a tunable parameter to adjust the decoherence proportions. By analytically
solving the exact dynamical equations, we find that steady-state coherence
depends on the initial state under collective decoherence, but not under
partial decoherence. Interestingly, non-Markovianity induces rich and complex
steady-state coherence behaviors. Our results offer new insights into the role
of non-Markovian decoherence in quantum systems and serve as a benchmark for
evaluating approximate methods in modelling quantum processes.

Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a promising technology for solving complex
optimization problems that arise in various engineering fields, and therefore
has the potential to also significantly impact power electronics applications.
This paper offers a concise tutorial on fundamental concepts in quantum
computing, serving as both an introduction to the field and a bridge to its
potential applications in power electronics. As a first step in this direction,
the use of quantum computing for solving offline mixed-integer optimization
problems commonly encountered in power electronics is examined. To this end, a
simplified power electronics design problem is reformulated as a quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and executed on quantum
hardware, despite current limitations such as low qubit counts and hardware
noise. This demonstration marks a pioneering step towards leveraging quantum
methods in power electronics. Moreover, the implications of ongoing
advancements in quantum algorithms and hardware are discussed, highlighting
their potential to enable the efficient solution of large-scale, multiobjective
design and control problems. The presented findings suggest that early adoption
and exploration of quantum computing could significantly expand the
capabilities and performance of power electronic systems in the near future.

Method: 通过限制初始状态（所有站点状态相同，仅一个站点例外）和考虑有限晶格尺寸，分析问题的复杂性。

Result: 初始状态受限版本问题不可解（RE-complete）；有限晶格尺寸下，问题可能是EXPSPACE-complete或PSPACE-complete。

Conclusion: 不同初始状态和晶格尺寸对计算复杂性有显著影响，进一步验证了问题的复杂性边界。

Abstract: This work is an extention of Shiraishi and Matsumoto [10], and discusses the
computational complexity of the long-term average of local observables in
one-dimensional lattices with shift-invariant nearest-neighbor interactions for
simple initial states. As shown in the previous paper, the problem is generally
intractable. In this paper we refine the statement further. First, we consider
restriction of the initial state, where the state of all the sites are the same
except for a single site. We show this version of the problem is also
undecidable (RE-complete). Then we turn to the case where the lattice size is
finite: depening on the defitiniton of the input size, this version of problem
is either EXPSPACE-complete or PSPACE-complete.

Conclusion: 量子计算环境下需要重新设计访问控制系统，以应对量子纠缠带来的安全挑战。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of computer security that prevents
unauthorised access to resources. In this paper, we study access control in
quantum computer systems. We present the first explicit scenario of a security
breach when a classically secure access control system is straightforwardly
adapted to the quantum setting. The breach is ultimately due to that quantum
mechanics allows the phenomenon of entanglement and violates Mermin inequality,
a multi-party variant of the celebrated Bell inequality. This reveals a threat
from quantum entanglement to access control if existing computer systems
integrate with quantum computing. To protect against such threat, we propose
several new models of quantum access control, and rigorously analyse their
security, flexibility and efficiency.

Motivation: 现代传感器（如引力波观测器和暗物质探测器）受限于量子噪声，经典方法在低信噪比下难以定位微弱信号频率。

Method: 提出“量子白化”协议，通过投影到“量子白化”的可能量子态上，实现频率估计。分析了宽先验极限下的理论结果，并通过数值模拟验证了有限宽度先验的效果。

Result: 量子白化协议在量子噪声背景下优于经典方法，能够更高效地定位微弱信号频率。

Conclusion: 量子白化不仅加速了未知频率的搜索，还可用于无先验信息的单参数编码传感。

Abstract: Searching for a weak signal at an unknown frequency is a canonical task in
experiments probing fundamental physics such as gravitational-wave
observatories and ultra-light dark matter haloscopes. These state-of-the-art
sensors are limited by quantum noise arising from the fundamental uncertainty
about the state of the device. Classically, frequency estimation suffers from a
threshold effect in the signal-to-noise ratio such that weak signals are
extremely hard to localise in frequency. We show that this phenomenon persists
at the fundamental quantum limit but that the classical approach, a quadrature
measurement, can nevertheless be beaten by a coherent protocol of projecting
onto the "quantum whitened" possible quantum states. Quantum whitening is a
covariant measurement, and we examine it analytically in the wide-prior limit
and numerically for finite-width priors. Beyond accelerating searches for
unknown frequencies, quantum whitening may be used generally to sense the
parameter of a unitary encoding given no prior information about the parameter.

Conclusion: 研究结果为不同噪声源对传感性能的影响提供了定量分析，强调了资源分配优化在实际量子应用中的重要性。

Abstract: Presence of harmful noise is inevitable in entanglement-enhanced sensing
systems, requiring careful allocation of resources to optimize sensing
performance in practical scenarios. We advocate a simple but effective strategy
to improve sensing performance in the presence of noise. Given a fixed number
of quantum sensors, we partition the preparation of GHZ states by preparing
smaller, independent sub-ensembles of GHZ states instead of a GHZ state across
all sensors. We perform extensive analytical studies of the phase estimation
performance when using partitioned GHZ states under realistic noise --
including state preparation error, particle loss during parameter encoding, and
sensor dephasing during parameter encoding. We derive simple, closed-form
expressions that quantify the optimal number of sub-ensembles for partitioned
GHZ states. We also examine the explicit noisy quantum sensing dynamics under
dephasing and loss, where we demonstrate the advantage from partitioning for
maximal QFI, short-time QFI increase, and the sensing performance in the
sequential scheme. The results offer quantitative insights into the sensing
performance impact of different noise sources and reinforce the importance of
resource allocation optimization in realistic quantum applications.

Motivation: 量子神经网络在量子机器学习中具有潜力，但其可训练性和表达能力的平衡尚未解决。

Method: 引入LCQNN框架，利用线性组合单位操作协调量子神经网络的组成，并通过限制子空间或采用k-局部控制单位操作来防止梯度消失。

Result: LCQNN在保持足够参数量的同时避免了梯度消失，并扩展到群作用场景，避免了贫瘠高原问题。

Conclusion: LCQNN为量子资源提供了一种新颖框架，既能保持可训练性，又能处理复杂的机器学习任务。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks combine quantum computing with advanced data-driven
methods, offering promising applications in quantum machine learning. However,
the optimal paradigm of quantum neural networks in the context trainability and
expressivity remains an open question. To overcome this issue, we first
introduce a framework called Linear Combination of Quantum Neural Networks
(LCQNN), which leverages the linear combination of unitaries concept to
coordinate the composition of QNNs, thereby balancing trainability and
expressivity. Secondly, LCQNN provides a tunable design that can reduce
vanishing gradients without incurring excessive classical simulability.
Specifically, we detail how restricting certain subspaces or adopting $k$-local
control unitaries prevents gradients from collapsing while maintaining enough
parameter volume for complex tasks. These findings also align with prior
discussions on expanding QNN capabilities for multi-qubit systems.
Additionally, we extend the LCQNN to the group action scenarios. By exploiting
symmetry, the LCQNN model, excluding exponentially large irreducible subspaces,
can circumvent barren plateaus. Overall, LCQNN provides a novel framework for
focusing quantum resources into architectures that remain practically trainable
yet expressive enough to tackle challenging machine-learning applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为实验验证Schrödinger-Newton方程提供了新途径，有望推动量子力学与引力界面的研究。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Newton (SN) equation introduces a nonlinear
self-gravitational term to the standard Schr\"odinger equation, offering a
paradigmatic model for semiclassical gravity. However, the small deviations it
predicts from standard quantum mechanics pose significant experimental
challenges. We propose a novel method to amplify such deviations through
periodic modulation of the trapping frequency in a levitated mechanical
oscillator. We identify specific regimes where the SN-induced effects on the
dynamics of second moments are significantly enhanced-by up to six orders of
magnitude compared to unmodulated setups. We show that this protocol remains
feasible within current magnetic levitation technologies and enables
distinguishability between standard and SN dynamics using measurable quantities
such as the position variance. Our results pave the way for a viable
experimental test of the SN equation, offering a new route to probe the
interface between quantum mechanics and gravity.

Abstract: We present a three-qubit quantum state tomography scheme requiring a set of
17 measurements, significantly reducing the experimental overhead compared to
the conventional 63 Pauli measurements. Using IBM's 127-qubit open-access
quantum processor ibm osaka, we prepare the three-qubit W state and employ our
tomography scheme to reconstruct it. Additionally, we implement a two-qubit
tomography protocol, involving a set of 7 measurements, on ibm osaka to
reconstruct two of the two-qubit marginals of the W state. This serves as a
proof-of-principle demonstration of the well-known theoretical result that any
two of the two-qubit reduced density matrices can uniquely determine most of
the whole three-qubit pure states. We show that the fidelity of the W-state
reconstructed from its two-qubit subsystems is consistently larger than that
obtained from the full three-qubit tomography, highlighting the practical
advantage of the subsystem-based tomography approach.

Abstract: Our recent study on the Bethe lattice reported that a discontinuous
percolation transition emerges as the number of occupied links increases and
each node rewires its links to locally suppress the growth of neighboring
clusters. However, since the Bethe lattice is a tree, a macroscopic cluster
forms as an infinite spanning tree but does not contain a finite fraction of
the nodes. In this paper, we study a bipartite network that can be regarded as
a locally tree-like structure with long-range neighbors. In this network, each
node in one of the two partitions is allowed to rewire its links to nodes in
the other partition to suppress the growth of neighboring clusters. We observe
a discontinuous percolation transition characterized by the emergence of a
single macroscopic cluster containing a finite fraction of nodes, followed by
critical behavior of the cluster size distribution. We also provide an
analytical explanation of the underlying mechanism.

Abstract: We study analytically and numerically a Hopfield fully-connected network with
$d$-vector spins. These networks are models of associative memory that
generalize the standard Hopfield with Ising spins. We study the equilibrium and
out-of-equilibrium properties of the system, considering the system in its
retrieval phase $\alpha<\alpha_c$ and beyond. We derive the Replica Symmetric
solution for the equilibrium thermodynamics of the system, together with its
phase diagram: we find that the retrieval phase of the network shrinks with
growing spin dimension, having ultimately a vanishing critical capacity
$\alpha_c\propto 1/d$ in the large $d$ limit. As a trade-off, we observe that
in the same limit vector Hopfield networks are able to denoise corrupted input
patterns in the first step of retrieval dynamics, up to very large capacities
$\widetilde{\alpha}\propto d$. We also study the static properties of the
system at zero temperature, considering the statistical properties of soft
modes of the energy Hessian spectrum. We find that local minima of the energy
landscape related to memory states have ungapped spectra with rare soft
eigenmodes: these excitations are localized, their measure condensating on the
noisiest neurons of the memory state.

Abstract: We first present a comparative analysis of temperature evolution of the
excess thermodynamic potentials (state functions), the enthalpy $\Delta H$,
entropy $\Delta S$ and Gibbs free energy $\Delta \Phi$, determined for
\textit{i}) undercooled melts using literature data and \textit{ii}) solid
glassy state calculated on the basis of calorimetry measurements using an
approach proposed recently. Three metallic alloys were taken as an example for
data analysis. It is found that temperature dependences $\Delta H(T)$, $\Delta
S(T)$ and $\Delta G(T)$ calculated with both approaches coincide in the
supercooled liquid range (i.e. at temperatures $T_g<T<T_x$, where $T_g$ and
$T_x$ are the glass transition and crystallization onset temperatures,
respectively). However, the necessary conditions for this coincidence is the
introduction of important changes to the above approach \textit{i}), which are
related to the calculation of the melting entropy. We also introduce and
calculate a dimensionless order parameter $\xi$, which changes in the range
$0<\xi<1$ and characterizes the evolution of the structural order from
liquid-like to crystal-like one. It is shown that the order parameter
$\xi_{scl}$ calculated for the end of the supercooled liquid range (i.e. for a
temperature just below $T_x$) correlates with the melt critical cooling rate
$R_c$: the smaller the order parameter $\xi_{scl}$ (i.e. the closer the
structure to that of the equilibrium liquid), the smaller $R_c$ is.

Abstract: The study investigates the formation, stability and dynamic advancement of
two-dimensional vortex quantum droplets within binary Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs), shaped by the interplay of photonic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
quantum fluctuation effects. SOC leads to significant droplet stretching,
resulting in vortex clusters forming in each component. The competition between
photonic SOC and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) interactions introduces vortices into the
condensate, described by the numerically solved Gross-Pitaevskii equation
(GPE). The results show that droplets like structures arise at low SOC
strengths and interaction parameters. The transition to vortex takes place as
the SOC increases. Enhanced interactions give rise to the emergence of quantum
droplets as the vortices dissipate, demonstrating fascinating dynamics. These
findings enhance understanding of the physical properties of photonic SOC
coupled binary BECs in 2D with LHY correction, impacting cold-atom physics and
condensed matter research. The study can also be expanded to explore quantum
droplets with a small atom count, which is advantageous for experimental
applications.

Abstract: A common wisdom about quantum many-body systems is that emergent phases
typically fall into either the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm or topological
classifications. Experimentally realizing the intertwined emergence of
spontaneous symmetry breaking and topological order remains challenging. Here,
we present an experimentally accessible platform for studying magnetic
topological states in a spin-orbit-coupled Lieb lattice. Remarkably, we observe
the coexistence of topological characteristics, quantified by the Chern number
and Bott index, with spontaneous symmetry-breaking orders, such as
ferrimagnetism, in the many-body ground states. Computational analyses
combining dynamical mean-field theory and Hartree-Fock approximations reveal a
pronounced parameter regime where magnetic topological insulators emerge even
under weak interactions. This unconventional phenomenon originates from the
Lieb lattice's unique band structure, which facilitates the synergy between
interaction-driven symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling induced band
inversion. Crucially, spin polarization and spin winding co-emerge as
inherently coupled phenomena due to their shared origin in the same
interacting, spinful atoms. We further propose a specific experimental
implementation scheme for ultracold atoms, utilizing currently available Raman
lattice techniques. Our findings pave the way for exploring the interplay
between symmetry-broken states and topological order in strongly correlated
systems.

Abstract: This study focuses on microscopic-sized quantum vortex filaments that are
shaped like a circle. The model we considered examines loops with different
radii and a small but non-zero core diameter. These loops are located in a
bounded domain $D$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortices is based
on the new approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal22_1,Tal24_2}. For these
loops, we calculate both the quantized circulation and the energy spectrum,
which are perfectly non-trivial. To understand how the results we have obtained
can be used to describe the initial stage of turbulence in a quantum fluid, we
study a system of $K$ random, non-interacting vortices. We explain how specific
energy and circulation spectra lead to the occurrence of turbulence in the
context of the developed approach.

Abstract: Building on the fundamental equation, this study revisits key thermodynamic
concepts in a cohesive and innovative manner. It demonstrates the consistency
of thermodynamic theory while addressing and clarifying common misconceptions
and errors found in the literature, particularly regarding discussions on heat

can be retained if their various and different definitions are clearly
articulated and properly understood. The proposed theoretical framework was
tested using the free expansion of an ideal gas, a particularly demanding
example due to its abrupt nature. From an educational standpoint, this article

Abstract: We investigate the long time behavior of a pinned chain of $2N+1$
  oscillators, indexed by $x \in\{-N,\ldots, N\}$. The system is subjected to
an external driving force on the particle at $x=0$, of period
$\theta=2\pi/\omega$, and to frictional
  damping $\gamma>0$ at both endpoints $x=-N$ and $N$.
  The oscillators interact with a pinned and nearest neighbor harmonic
  plus anharmonic potentials of the form
  $\frac{\omega_0^2 q_x^2}{2}+\frac12 (q_{x}-q_{x-1})^2
+\nu\left[V(q_x)+U(q_x-q_{x-1}) \right]$, with $V''$ and $U''$
  bounded and $\nu\in \mathbb{R}$.
  We recall the recently proven convergence and the global stability of
  a perturbation series in powers of $\nu$ for
  $|\nu| < \nu_0$, yielding the long time periodic state of the
  system.
  Here $\nu_0$ depends only on the supremum norms of $V''$ and $U''$
  and the distance of the set of non-negative integer multiplicities of
  $\omega$ from the interval $[\omega_0,\sqrt{\omega_0^2+4}]$ - the spectrum of
  the infinite harmonic chain for $\nu=0$. We describe also some numerical
studies of this system going beyond our rigorous results.

Abstract: In this review, we show our results with new interpretation on the critical
exponents of thin films obtained by high-performance multi-histogram Monte
Carlo simulations. The film thickness $N_z$ consists of a few layers up to a
dozen of layers in the $z$ direction. The free boundary condition is applied in
this direction while in the $xy$ plane periodic boundary conditions are used.
Large $xy$ plane sizes are used for finite-size scaling. The Ising model is
studied with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction. When $N_z=1$, namely the
two-dimensional (2D) system, we find the critical exponents given by the
renormalization group. While, for $N_z>1$, the critical exponents calculated
with the high-precision multi-histogram technique show that they deviate
slightly but systematically from the 2D values. If we use these values of
critical exponents in the hyperscaling relation with $d=2$, then the
hyperscaling relation is violated. However, if we use the hyperscaling relation
and the critical exponents obtained for $N_z>1$ to calculate the dimension of
the system, we find the system dimension slightly larger than 2. This can be
viewed as an "effective" dimension. More discussion is given in the paper. We
also show the cross-over between the first- and second-order transition while
varying the film thickness in an antiferromagnetic FCC Ising frustrated thin
film. In addition, we will show evidence that when a 2D system has two order
parameters of different symmetries with a single transition, the critical
exponents are new, suggesting a universality class of coupled two-symmetry
breakings. In this case, the 2D hyperscaling does not hold. Another case is the
3D Ising model coupled to the lattice vibration: the critical exponents deviate
from the 3D Ising ones, the results suggest the violation of the hyperscaling.

Motivation: 在纳米尺度下，随机效应不仅影响物理系统的动力学，还可能影响其观测。传统粗粒化方法假设唯一粗粒化轨迹，但实际观测可能存在误差。

Method: 通过路径权重分析，提出一种条件确保观测熵产不增加，适用于存在观测误差的系统。以马尔可夫网络为例，推导热力学界限。

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了随机热力学的应用，为后续研究提供了基础，尤其是在存在粗粒化误差时的热力学界限分析。

Abstract: At the nanoscale, random effects govern not only the dynamics of a physical
system but may also affect its observation. This work introduces a novel
paradigm for coarse graining that eschews the assignment of a unique
coarse-grained trajectory to a microscopic one. Instead, observations are not
only coarse-grained but are also accompanied by a small chance of error.
Formulating the problem in terms of path weights, we identify a condition on
the structure of errors that ensures that the observed entropy production does
not increase. As a result, the framework of stochastic thermodynamics for
estimating entropy production can be extended to this broader class of systems.
As an application, we consider Markov networks in which individual transitions
can be observed but may be mistaken for each other. We motivate, derive, and
illustrate thermodynamic bounds that relate the error sensitivity of the
observed entropy production to the strength of the driving and are valid for
arbitrary network topologies. If sufficiently many transitions in the network
can be observed, redundancies in the coarse-grained trajectories can be used to
detect and correct errors, which potentially improves naive estimates of
entropy production. We conclude with an outlook on subsequent research on
thermodynamic bounds for erroneous coarse graining.

Abstract: Inverse problems arise in situations where data is available, but the

of the latter starting from the former. Statistical mechanics offers a toolbox
of techniques to address this challenge. In this work, we illustrate three of
the main methods: the Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood, and
Mean-Field approaches. We begin with a thorough theoretical introduction to
these methods, followed by their application to inference in several well-known
statistical physics systems undergoing phase transitions. Namely, we consider
the ordered and disordered Ising models, the vector Potts model, and the
Blume-Capel model on both regular lattices and random graphs. This discussion
is accompanied by a GitHub repository that allows users to both reproduce the

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We demonstrate that the chiral $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric code -- the
quintessential model of topological order -- hosts additional, emergent
topological phases when perturbed: descendant fractional quantum Hall-like
states, which we term \textit{Hall-on-Toric}. These hierarchical states feature
fractionalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$ charges and increased topological ground-state
degeneracy. The Hall-on-Toric phases appear in the vicinity of the transitions
between deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_p$ phases with different background charge per
unit cell, in a fixed non-trivial flux background. We confirm their existence
through extensive infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG)
simulations, analyzing the topological entanglement entropy, entanglement
spectra, and a generalized Hall conductance. Remarkably, the Hall-on-Toric
states remain robust even in the absence of $U(1)$ symmetry. Our findings
reinforce the foundational interpretation of star and plaquette defects as
magnetic and electric excitations, and reveal that this perspective extends to
a much deeper level.

Motivation: 探索内部对称性与时空对称性的相互作用，以更全面地理解对称性富集拓扑序及其在物理系统中的应用。

Method: 通过分析2+1D SET的间隙边界对对称性的影响，构建SymTFT框架，并应用于1+1D对称性的规范化和异常检测，以及分类对称性富集相。

Conclusion: SymTFT框架为研究时空对称性与内部对称性的相互作用提供了有力工具，并成功应用于1+1D系统的对称性分析和分类。

Abstract: We extend the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) framework beyond
internal symmetries by including geometric data that encode spacetime
symmetries. Concretely, we enrich the SymTFT of an internal symmetry by
spacetime symmetries and study the resulting symmetry-enriched topological
(SET) order, which captures the interplay between the spacetime and internal
symmetries. We illustrate the framework by focusing on symmetries in 1+1D. To
this end, we first analyze how gapped boundaries of 2+1D SETs affect the
enriching symmetry, and apply this within the SymTFT framework to gauging and
detecting anomalies of the 1+1D symmetry, as well as to classifying 1+1D
symmetry-enriched phases. We then consider quantum spin chains and explicitly
construct the SymTFTs for three prototypical spacetime symmetries: lattice
translations, spatial reflections, and time reversal. For lattice translations,
the interplay with internal symmetries is encoded in the SymTFT by translations
permuting anyons, which causes the continuum description of the SymTFT to be a
foliated field theory. Using this, we elucidate the relation between
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomalies and modulated symmetries and classify
modulated symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. For reflection and
time-reversal symmetries, the interplay can additionally be encoded by symmetry
fractionalization data in the SymTFT, and we identify mixed anomalies and study
gauging for such examples.

Motivation: 探索BaAl4家族中不同成员（如SrAl4和EuAl4）的电荷密度波（CDW）和磁有序态的演化机制。

Conclusion: 电荷有序态与声子不稳定性密切相关，揭示了CDW态的电子-声子起源。

Abstract: The BaAl$_4$-type structure family is home to a vast landscape of interesting
and exotic properties, with descendant crystal structures hosting a variety of
electronic ground states including magnetic, superconducting and strongly
correlated electron phenomena. BaAl$_4$ itself hosts a non-trivial topological
band structure, but is otherwise a paramagnetic metal. However, the other
members of the $A$Al$_4$ family ($A$= alkali earth), including SrAl$_4$ and
EuAl$_4$, exhibit symmetry-breaking ground states including charge density wave
(CDW) and magnetic orders. Here we investigate the properties of the solid
solution series Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Al$_4$ and Ba$_{1-y}$Eu$_y$Al$_4$ using
transport, thermodynamic and scattering experiments to study the evolution of
the charge-ordered state as it is suppressed with Ba substitution to zero near
50% substitution in both systems. Neutron and x-ray diffraction measurements
reveal an incommensurate CDW state in SrAl$_4$ with $c$-axis-oriented ordering
vector (0, 0, 0.097) that evolves with Ba substitution toward a shorter
wavelength. A similar progression is observed in the Ba$_{1-y}$Eu$_y$Al$_4$
series that also scales with the ordering temperature, revealing a universal
correlation between charge-order transition temperature and ordering vector
that points to a critical wavevector that stabilizes CDW order in both systems.
We study the evolution of the phonon band structure in the
Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Al$_4$ system, revealing the suppression of the CDW phase
matches the suppression of a phonon instability at precisely the same momentum
as observed in experiments, confirming the electron-phonon origin of charge
order in this system.

Conclusion: 通过拓扑-全息对应关系，确认了1D MSPT相的2D体理论，为理解非可逆对称性在SPT相中的作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: We examine noninvertible symmetry (NIS) in one-dimensional (1D)
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases protected by dipolar and
exponential-charge symmetries, which are two key examples of modulated SPT
(MSPT). To set the stage, we first study NIS in the $\mathbb{Z}_N \times
\mathbb{Z}_N$ cluster model, extending previous work on the $\mathbb{Z}_2
\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ case. For each symmetry type (charge, dipole,
exponential), we explicitly construct the noninvertible Kramers-Wannier (KW)
and Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations, revealing dual models with spontaneous
symmetry breaking (SSB). The resulting symmetry group structure of the SSB
model is rich enough that it allows the identification of other SSB models with
the same symmetry. Using these alternative SSB models and KT duality, we
generate novel MSPT phases distinct from those associated with the standard
decorated domain wall picture, and confirm their distinctiveness by projective
symmetry analyses at their interfaces. Additionally, we establish a
topological-holographic correspondence by identifying the 2D bulk theories-two
coupled layers of toric codes (charge), anisotropic dipolar toric codes
(dipole), and exponentially modulated toric codes (exponential)-whose
boundaries host the respective 1D MSPT phases.

distinct features such as drumhead surface states and unique electromagnetic
responses. This review classifies various NLSM types based on their nodal
structures and protecting symmetries, highlighting that these nodal-line
structures can form links, knots, and chains. We discuss their characteristic
electromagnetic responses, including Landau level spectroscopy, optical
conductivity, and permittivity. Furthermore, the strong correlation effects in
these NLSMs modify their semimetallic phases and lead to novel quantum phases
where magnetism and superconductivity intertwine.

Abstract: Motivated by theoretical and experimental studies reported by Yamaguchi et
al. (Phys. Rev. B 98, 094402 (2018)), we performed a cluster mean-field
analysis of an anisotropic Heisenberg model with six competing exchange
interactions. We study the ground and thermal states by tuning the spin
anisotropy, magnetic field, and temperature. Our results show that an external
magnetic field induces quantum fluctuations, suppressing local moments and
leading to the occurrence of a magnetization plateaulike state. When weak spin
anisotropy is considered, the competing interactions are affected, and the
field-induced fluctuations can lead to a well-defined magnetization plateau
within a field range, in which an exotic quantum state can emerge. This state
exhibits the coexistence of ferromagnetic and dimerized chains driven by the
relation between frustration and the external field. Moreover, we identify a
phase transition from a collinear antiferromagnetic order to a disordered state
at a finite temperature. Our findings reveal unconventional magnetic properties
at low temperatures that can guide future experimental studies of
verdazyl-based compounds with anisotropic exchange interactions.

Abstract: The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of
strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic
research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper
the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the
background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a
field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the
electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying
holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the
spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling
strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing
this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation
of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas
microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for
verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent
fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their
internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole
pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in
the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase.
Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate
interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the
emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of
freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the
conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring
the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a
QSL.

Conclusion: 该方法在小$t/V$下准确捕捉了相关性，为非平凡单元结构的电子系统研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Charge ordering induced by strong short-range repulsion in itinerant fermion
systems typically follows a two-sites alternation pattern. However, the
covariance matrix spectrum of the one-dimensional, half-filled, spinless
$t$-$V$ model reveals a post-Hartree-Fock picture at strong repulsion, with
emergent four-site disruptions of the underlying staggered mean-field state.
These disruptions are captured in a thermodynamically extensive manner by a
compact four-fermion Coupled Cluster (doubles) state (CCS). Remarkably, all
properties of this state may be computed analytically by combinatorial means,
and also derived from an exactly solvable correlated hopping Hamiltonian.
Furthermore, this Coupled Cluster state can be re-expressed as a low-rank
Matrix Product State (MPS) with bond dimension exactly four. In addition, we
unveil a hidden connection between this Coupled Cluster ansatz and a
Rokhsar-Kivelson state (RKS), which is the ground state of a solvable parent
quantum tetramer model. The broad picture that we uncover here thus provides
deep connections between several core concepts of correlated fermions and
quantum chemistry that have previously enjoyed limited synergy. In contrast to
a recent perturbative treatment on top of Hartree-Fock theory, our approach
asymptotically captures the correct correlations in the $t$-$V$ model at small
$t/V$, and remains a qualitatively accurate approximation even outside the
perturbative regime. Our results make the case for further studies of the
covariance matrix for correlated electron systems in which ground states have
non-trivial unit-cell structure.

Conclusion: 各向异性RKKY模型可能为Ce基及其他重费米子系统的复杂磁性提供更深入理解。

Abstract: Ferromagnetic (FM) Kondo-lattice (KL) compounds often exhibit intriguing
magnetic behavior driven by strong crystal electric field (CEF) anisotropy and
exchange interactions. Recent studies suggest that many Ce-based and Yb-based
KL ferromagnets order along the hard-axis or hard-plane determined by their CEF
ground state. We performed a survey of Ce-based FM compounds, complemented with
new single crystal synthesis, magnetization measurements, and analysis of the
CEF scheme. Our results reveal that hard-axis/plane ordering is less common
than previously reported, with most compounds ordering along their
easy-axis/plane. We also find no clear correlation between the strength of the
Kondo effect and whether a compound adopts hard-axis/plane or easy-axis/plane
ordering. Instead, the key driver appears to be the competition between CEF
anisotropy and exchange interaction anisotropy. A direct comparison of CeCuSi
and CeAgSb$_2$ further indicates that antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions
along the CEF easy-axis can be crucial in stabilizing the hard-axis FM ordering
observed in CeAgSb$_2$. Finally, our results suggest that an anisotropic
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) model could offer deeper insights into the
complicated magnetic properties of Ce-based and other heavy-fermion systems.

heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled

neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.
Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging

Motivation: 探讨一维Hubbard模型中自旋和电荷输运的温度依赖性，解决流体动力学理论与KPZ标度预测与最新精确结果之间的矛盾。

Method: 结合理论分析和数值模拟，识别控制自旋和电荷输运温度依赖性的机制。

Result: 发现电荷输运在所有有限温度下均为正常扩散，而自旋输运仍为超扩散。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了电荷输运行为的真实特性，修正了流体动力学理论和KPZ标度的预测。

Abstract: Studies relying on hydrodynamic theory and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling
have found that in the one-dimensional Hubbard model spin and charge transport
are for all temperatures T > 0 anomalous superdiffusive at zero magnetic field,
h = 0, and zero chemical potential, {\mu} = 0, respectively. However, this
contradicts recent exact results that at very low temperature charge transport
rather is normal diffusive. In this Letter we identify the mechanisms that
control the different types of temperature dependence of the h = 0 spin and
{\mu} = 0 charge transport and find that the latter is normal diffusive for all
finite temperatures T > 0, in contrast to the hydrodynamic theory and KPZ
scaling predictions.

Abstract: Helicons are transverse electromagnetic modes in three-dimensional (3D)
electron systems in the presence of a static magnetic field. These modes have
been proposed in isotropic or single Weyl semimetals(WSMs) (Francesco M.D.
Pellegrino et al, Phys.\ Rev.\ B {\bf 92}, 201407(R) (2015)). In this work, we
introduce a tilt term to investigate helicon modes in gapless WSMs within a
semiclassical Boltzmann approach and show that the helicon modes exist in
tilted WSMs.

Abstract: Thermal and photothermal effects play an increasing role at the nanoscale due
to the general decrease of thermal conductances and to the increasing role of
interfaces. Here we present a non-contact optomechanical analysis of the
thermal and photothermal properties of suspended nanowires based on pump-probe
response measurements: a probe laser measures the nanowire deformations and
property changes caused by an intensity-modulated pump laser launching thermal
waves propagating along the 1D conductor. The analysis of the dominant
photothermal contributions to the nanowires response in the spectral and
spatial domains allows in particular to quantify the interfacial contact
resistance, to detect its internal optical resonances and to image absorption
inhomogeneities. Additionally, by exploiting the temperature-induced optical
reflectivity changes of the nanowire, we directly image the spatial structure
of the thermal waves propagating within the nanowire. Finally we investigate
how those thermal waves are responsible for a dynamical modulation of the
nanowire vibration frequency, in the resolved sideband regime, providing novel
analytical tools to further inspect the structural properties of
nano-optomechanical systems with a large signal to noise ratio. Those methods
are generic and critical to correctly understand the photothermal dynamical
back action processes and improve the intrinsic sensitivity of those
ultrasensitive force probes.

Motivation: 研究1H-NbSe$_2$及其相关化合物的电子结构和能带拓扑，以理解其超导性和电荷密度波的特性。

Method: 通过Wannier化ab initio能带，构建了单带、3带和6带模型，并采用新的近似方案和微扰理论分析Wannier函数。

Result: 发现阻碍原子Wannier函数在3带模型中具有高精度（>90%），单带模型中次近邻跳跃大于近邻跳跃，且NbSe$_2$的Wannier函数精度达95%。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来探讨量子几何对材料相关相的影响奠定了基础。

Abstract: We revisit the electronic structure and band topology of monolayer
1H-NbSe$_2$, which hosts both superconductivity and charge density wave, and
its related compounds 1H-MoS$_2$, NbS$_2$, TaS$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$. We
construct a 6-band, a 3-band, and - simplest of all - a single-band model for
this material family, by directly Wannierizing the ab initio bands. All host
obstructed atomic isolated bands away from the atomic positions near the Fermi
energy. We find that in the 3-band model, the obstructed atomic Wannier
function can be well approximated by an optimally compact Wannier function with
more than 90% accuracy for all the compounds, rising to a remarkable 94%
accuracy in NbSe$_2$. Interestingly, the simplest single-band model has next
nearest-neighboring hopping larger than the nearest-neighboring hopping (by
nearly an order of magnitude for MoS$_2$, NbSe$_2$, TaSe$_2$ and WS$_2$), which
comes from the cancellation between the atomic onsite terms and the atomic
nearest-neighboring hopping after projecting to the obstructed atomic Wannier
functions. Furthermore for NbSe$_2$, we employ a novel approximation scheme to
obtain an effective Hamiltonian that captures the 3 bands originating mainly
from the Nb atom. We also use conventional perturbation theory to derive the ab
initio obstructed Wannier function with 95% accuracy. Our results pave the way
for future study of the effect of quantum geometry on the correlated phases in
this family of materials.

Motivation: 探索石墨烯纳米结构中量子霍尔态与超导体界面的Andreev转换特性，特别是界面透明度和几何形状的影响。

Method: 使用紧束缚模型分析几种锯齿边缘的石墨烯纳米结构，计算电子入射界面后的散射态及Andreev转换概率。

Result: 发现部分透明界面下，电子-空穴杂化模式非谷简并，且转角处存在谷间散射；QH区Andreev转换比零磁场更稳健。

Conclusion: 量子霍尔态下Andreev转换对界面透明度的敏感性不同于零磁场情况，且更稳定。

Abstract: We study Andreev conversion in clean nanostructures containing an interface
between graphene in the quantum Hall (QH) state and a superconductor, focusing
on the lowest Landau level. First, several graphene nanostructures formed from
zigzag edges with sharp corners are considered using a tight-binding model. We
find the scattering state for an electron impinging on the interface from the
upstream QH edge state, together with the probability of it exiting as a hole
in the downstream QH edge state (Andreev conversion). From these results, we
deduce the behavior for edges at an arbitrary angle and for rounded corners. A
key issue is whether the graphene-superconductor interface is fully transparent
or only partially transparent. For full transparency, we recover previous
results. In contrast, interfaces with partial but substantial transparency
(well away from the tunneling limit) behave very differently: (i) the hybrid
electron-hole interfacial modes are not valley degenerate and (ii) intervalley
scattering can occur at the corners, even when rounded. As a result,
interference between the two hybrid modes can occur, even in the absence of
disorder. Finally, we compare the sensitivity of Andreev conversion to
interface transparency in the QH regime to that in the absence of a magnetic
field. While the zero-field result closely follows the classic
Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk relation, Andreev conversion in the QH regime is
considerably more robust.

Conclusion: 研究首次全面描述了铁氧化物NFs的自旋结构，为设计高效纳米加热器提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Iron-oxide nanoflowers (NFs) are one of the most efficient nanoheaters for
magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT). However, the physics underlying the spin
texture of disordered iron-oxide nanoparticles beyond the single-domain limit
remains still poorly understood. Using large-scale micromagnetic simulations we
completely map the magnetization of NFs over an unprecedented size range, from
10 to 400 nm in diameter, connecting their microstructure to their macroscopic
magnetic response. Above the single domain (d > 50 nm), the magnetization folds
into a vortex state, within which the coercivity describes a secondary maximum,
not present for non-disordered nanoparticles. We have extended our
understanding by resolving also the NF magnetization dynamics, capturing the
physics of the magnetization reversal. Within the vortex regime, two distinct
reversal modes exist: i) A core-dominated one, in which the core immediately
switches along the direction of the applied field, resulting in an increasing
coercivity for larger sizes; and ii) a flux-closure dominated reversal mode,
going through the perpendicular alignment of the vortex core to the field,
resulting in a decreasing coercivity-size dependence. The coercivity maximum is
located at the transition between both reversal modes, and results from the
combination of grain anisotropy and grain-boundary pinning: weak (but
non-negligible) inter-grain exchange keeps the vortex profile coherent, yet
allows the core to be pinned by the random anisotropy easy axes of the single
grains, maximizing magnetic losses. Our results provide the first full
description of spin textures in iron oxide NFs beyond the macrospin framework,
and clarify the role of internal spin disorder in magnetic hyperthermia
heating. By adjusting the grain size, the coercivity "sweet spot" can be
tailored, offering a practical route to next-generation, high-efficiency
nanoheaters.

Method: 通过输运计算研究非晶拓扑纳米线中的Aharanov-Bohm振荡和完美传输模式。

Result: 在低能量和适度非晶化下，非晶纳米线仍表现出完美传输模式；高非晶化下，振荡消失，出现非量子化共振峰。

Conclusion: 非晶纳米线的完美传输模式受手性对称性或统计时间反演对称性保护，高非晶化导致拓扑相变进入平庸绝缘相。

Abstract: Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded
through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A
characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present
at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective
time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire
surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross
section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry.
In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the
Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous
topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate
amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the
presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the
perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence,
by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the
Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by
nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and
relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the
nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.

Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising quantum
sensors but suffer from noise-induced short coherence times due to bulk and
surface impurities. We present interfacial engineering via oxygen termination
and graphene patching, extending shallow NV coherence to over 1 ms, approaching
the T1 limit. Raman spectroscopy and density-functional theory reveal surface
termination-driven graphene charge transfer reduces spin noise by pairing
surface electrons, supported by double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy
showing fewer unpaired spins. Enhanced sensitivity enables detection of single
weakly coupled 13C nuclear spins and external 11B spins from a hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) layer, achieving nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance. A
protective h-BN top layer stabilizes the platform, ensuring robustness against
harsh treatments and compatibility with target materials. This integrated
approach advances practical quantum sensing by combining extended coherence,
improved sensitivity, and device durability.

Abstract: Surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology has been explored in thin-film
materials to discover fundamental phenomena and to investigate their physical
properties. It is used to excite and manipulate quasi-particles such as phonons
or magnons, and can dynamically modulate the properties of the materials. In
the field, SAWs are typically excited by a continuous wave at a resonant
frequency. Recently, generation of a single-cycle SAW pulse has been
demonstrated on GaAs substrate. Such a SAW pulse provides a potential to access
a single quasi-particle excitation and to investigate its dynamics by
time-resolved measurements. On the other hand, to modulate and control the
properties of thin film materials, it is generally required to generate
high-intensity SAWs. In this work, we demonstrate the efficient generation of a
SAW pulse using a chirp interdigital transducer (IDT) on LiNbO$_3$ substrate.
We have fabricated chirp IDT devices with bandwidths from 0.5 GHz to 5.5 GHz.
We also confirmed the generation of a SAW pulse with 0.3 ns FWHM (full width at
half maximum) by performing time-resolved measurements. The conversion
efficiency between input power and SAW on LiNbO$_3$ substrate is approximately
45 times larger than that on GaAs substrate. This enables us to generate a
high-intensity SAW pulse, meeting the requirement for the modulation of thin
films. Our results will expand the research in the field, such as spintronics
and magnonics, and lead to their further advancements.

Conclusion: 光照射和长程跳跃是提高铁磁系统热电性能的有效策略，为高效能量转换提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study the charge and spin-dependent thermoelectric response of a
ferromagnetic helical system irradiated by arbitrarily polarized light, using a
tight-binding framework and the Floquet-Bloch formalism. Transport properties
for individual spin channels are determined by employing the non-equilibrium
Green's function technique, while phonon thermal conductance is evaluated using
a mass-spring model with different lead materials. The findings reveal that
that light irradiation induces spin-split transmission features, suppresses
thermal conductance, and yields favorable spin thermopower and figure of merit
(FOM). The spin FOM consistently outperforms its charge counterpart under
various light conditions. Moreover, long-range hopping is shown to enhance the
spin thermoelectric performance, suggesting a promising strategy for efficient
energy conversion in related ferromagnetic systems.

Result: SMR在0 THz至0.2 THz范围内下降约75%，并在1.5 THz时完全消失，表明非相干磁子的缓慢耗散是主要限制因素。

Conclusion: THz SMR可作为研究超快界面自旋-磁子耦合的有力工具。

Abstract: We report on the observation of spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) in
prototypical bilayers of ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and platinum
in the frequency range from 0 THz to as high as 1.5 THz. The spectral
composition of the effect exhibits a strong low-pass behavior, decreasing by
approximately 75% from 0 THz to 0.2 THz and vanishing entirely at 1.5 THz.
Using a dynamic magnetoresistive model, we can fully explain the spectral
dependence by competition of transverse spin-torque (coherent) and longitudinal
(incoherent) contributions to the spin current and their characteristic
response times. Our analysis suggests that the slow dissipation of incoherent
magnons from the interface is the limiting process responsible for the dramatic
spectral decay of the SMR. These results establish THz SMR as a powerful probe
of ultrafast interfacial spin-magnon coupling.

Conclusion: 超薄h-BN中生成SPE并封装为纳米级量子传感提供了新途径。

Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPE) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising
for applications ranging from single-photon sources to quantum sensors.
Previous studies exclusively focused on the generation and characterization of
SPEs in relatively thick h-BN layers ($\geq$ 30 nm). However, for electrical
and magnetic sensing applications, the thickness of the h-BN limits the
attainable spatial resolution. Here, we report the observation of
blue-wavelength emitters (B-centers) activated by electron beam irradiation in
ultra-thin ($\simeq$ 3 nm) h-BN. These SPEs in ultra-thin flakes exhibit
reduced brightness, broader zero-phonon line, and enhanced photobleaching.
Remarkably, upon encapsulation in thicker h-BN, we restore their brightness,
narrow linewidth 230$\mu$eV at 5K, resolution limited), suppress
photobleaching, and confirm single-photon emission with $ g^{(2)}(0) < 0.4$ at
room temperature. The possibility of generating SPEs in a few-layer h-BN and
their subsequent incorporation into a van der Waals heterostructure paves the
way for achieving quantum sensing with unprecedented nanometer-scale spatial
resolution.

Conclusion: TDNEGF+LLG理论为飞秒激光激发磁振子提供了微观解释，并提出了新的实验探测方法。

Abstract: Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons
within two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as
CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures --
suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details
remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy
range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be
operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which
time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by
classical vector potential of fsLP are coupled to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
(LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments
(LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory explains how fsLP,
with central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent
that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a genuine
nonequilibrium spintronic effect. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by
windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) reveals frequencies of excited magnons,
as well as their lifetime governed by nonlocal damping due to the bath of
electrons. In addition, the TDNEGF part of our TDNEGF+LLG self-consistent loop
computes a time-dependent density matrix whose off-diagonal elements are
utilized to describe, at the mean-field level, inter-orbital Coulomb
interaction binding electrons and holes into excitons. Our TDNEGF+LLG theory
predicts how excited magnons {\em pump} charge current into the attached
electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor responsible for microwave
emission. The windowed FFT of the former signal contains imprints of excited
magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited
as a novel probe in future experiments.
