SOC leads to significant droplet stretching,\nresulting in vortex clusters forming in each component. The competition between\nphotonic SOC and Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) interactions introduces vortices into the\ncondensate, described by the numerically solved Gross-Pitaevskii equation\n(GPE). The results show that droplets like structures arise at low SOC\nstrengths and interaction parameters. The transition to vortex takes place as\nthe SOC increases. Enhanced interactions give rise to the emergence of quantum\ndroplets as the vortices dissipate, demonstrating fascinating dynamics. These\nfindings enhance understanding of the physical properties of photonic SOC\ncoupled binary BECs in 2D with LHY correction, impacting cold-atom physics and\ncondensed matter research. The study can also be expanded to explore quantum\ndroplets with a small atom count, which is advantageous for experimental\napplications."}

Instead, observations are not\nonly coarse-grained but are also accompanied by a small chance of error.\nFormulating the problem in terms of path weights, we identify a condition on\nthe structure of errors that ensures that the observed entropy production does\nnot increase. As a result, the framework of stochastic thermodynamics for\nestimating entropy production can be extended to this broader class of systems.\nAs an application, we consider Markov networks in which individual transitions\ncan be observed but may be mistaken for each other. We motivate, derive, and\nillustrate thermodynamic bounds that relate the error sensitivity of the\nobserved entropy production to the strength of the driving and are valid for\narbitrary network topologies. If sufficiently many transitions in the network\ncan be observed, redundancies in the coarse-grained trajectories can be used to\ndetect and correct errors, which potentially improves naive estimates of\nentropy production. We conclude with an outlook on subsequent research on\nthermodynamic bounds for erroneous coarse graining."}

Remarkably, we observe\nthe coexistence of topological characteristics, quantified by the Chern number\nand Bott index, with spontaneous symmetry-breaking orders, such as\nferrimagnetism, in the many-body ground states. Computational analyses\ncombining dynamical mean-field theory and Hartree-Fock approximations reveal a\npronounced parameter regime where magnetic topological insulators emerge even\nunder weak interactions. This unconventional phenomenon originates from the\nLieb lattice's unique band structure, which facilitates the synergy between\ninteraction-driven symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling induced band\ninversion. Crucially, spin polarization and spin winding co-emerge as\ninherently coupled phenomena due to their shared origin in the same\ninteracting, spinful atoms. We further propose a specific experimental\nimplementation scheme for ultracold atoms, utilizing currently available Raman\nlattice techniques. Our findings pave the way for exploring the interplay\nbetween symmetry-broken states and topological order in strongly correlated\nsystems."}

A\ncode that is ``bias-tailored'' can exploit this imbalance, lowering the\nfault-tolerance overhead. A complementary idea, called \"single-shot\" error\ncorrection, aims to recover from data errors and noisy measurements in a single\nround of stabilizer readout, avoiding slow repetition cycles. In this work, we\ncombine these two ideas and build a hierarchy of new quantum codes.\n  The full construction starts from the syndrome-encoded hypergraph product\ncode and then tailors it to the dominant error type. The resulting code keeps\nthe single-shot guarantee for every noise model while boosting the threshold\nwhenever $X$ and $Z$ errors are asymmetric.\n  By removing carefully chosen blocks of stabilizers we obtain two trimmed\nvariants. The first, called the simplified code, cuts the physical-qubit count\nby $1/6$ and halves the number of stabilizer measurements, yet its minimum\ndistance grows quadratically compared to the standard design and its biased\nnoise threshold is unchanged. The second, called the reduced code, achieves the\nsame hardware savings but trades away single-shot protection for purely $X$ or\npurely $Z$ noise; instead it remains single-shot under balanced, or\ndepolarizing, noise. In settings where strongly biased noise is likely, either\ntrimmed code offers a less resource-intensive alternative to the full\nconstruction.\n  As a concrete illustration, we lift the two-dimensional XZZX surface code to\na three-dimensional cubic lattice and show that this ``3D XZZX'' code is an\nexplicit member of the simplified family.\n  Taken together, these bias-tailored single-shot codes provide an adjustable\nset of code design alternatives, allowing tradeoffs between hardware overhead\nand noise types."}
