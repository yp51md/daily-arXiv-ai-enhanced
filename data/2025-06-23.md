*Oluwaseyi Giwa,Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin,Muhammad Ali Jamshed*

TL;DR: QPPG是一种基于自然梯度的算法，用于链路自适应，通过量子Fisher信息预条件化和Tikhonov正则化实现稳定学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在结合经典与量子几何，提升在噪声环境下的强化学习性能。

Method: 使用全逆量子Fisher信息进行预条件化，并加入Tikhonov正则化。

Result: 在经典和量子环境中，QPPG比REINFORCE快4倍收敛，并在不确定性下保持1 dB增益。

Conclusion: QPPG展示了基于量子Fisher信息的预条件化在可扩展量子强化学习中的优势。

Abstract: In this letter, we propose Quantum-Preconditioned Policy Gradient (QPPG), a
natural gradient-based algorithm for link adaptation that whitens policy
updates using the full inverse quantum Fisher information with Tikhonov
regularization. QPPG bridges classical and quantum geometry, achieving stable
learning even under noise. Evaluated on classical and quantum environments,
including noisy single-qubit Gym tasks and Rayleigh-fading channels, QPPG
converges 4 times faster than REINFORCE and sustains a 1 dB gain under
uncertainty. It reaches a 90 percent return in one hundred episodes with high
noise robustness, showcasing the advantages of full QFI-based preconditioning
for scalable quantum reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于下一代储层计算的机器学习方法，用于提高量子比特状态识别的效率和保真度，同时降低计算复杂性和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理频率复用读取中的串扰时表现不佳，而现有神经网络方法计算成本高且扩展性差。

Method: 采用储层计算构建多项式特征，映射测量信号到量子比特状态，避免高成本非线性激活函数，支持实时训练。

Conclusion: 储层计算能高效提升量子比特状态识别，同时保持未来量子处理器的可扩展性。

Abstract: Quantum processors require rapid and high-fidelity simultaneous measurements
of many qubits. While superconducting qubits are among the leading modalities
toward a useful quantum processor, their readout remains a bottleneck.
Traditional approaches to processing measurement data often struggle to account
for crosstalk present in frequency-multiplexed readout, the preferred method to
reduce the resource overhead. Recent approaches to address this challenge use
neural networks to improve the state-discrimination fidelity. However, they are
computationally expensive to train and evaluate, resulting in increased latency
and poor scalability as the number of qubits increases. We present an
alternative machine learning approach based on next-generation reservoir
computing that constructs polynomial features from the measurement signals and
maps them to the corresponding qubit states. This method is highly
parallelizable, avoids the costly nonlinear activation functions common in
neural networks, and supports real-time training, enabling fast evaluation,
adaptability, and scalability. Despite its lower computational complexity, our
reservoir approach is able to maintain high qubit-state-discrimination
fidelity. Relative to traditional methods, our approach achieves error
reductions of up to 50% and 11% on single- and five-qubit datasets,
respectively, and delivers up to 2.5x crosstalk reduction on the five-qubit
dataset. Compared with recent machine-learning methods, evaluating our model
requires 100x fewer multiplications for single-qubit and 2.5x fewer for
five-qubit models. This work demonstrates that reservoir computing can enhance
qubit-state discrimination while maintaining scalability for future quantum
processors.

### [4] [Fast simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy for battery materials on a quantum computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15784)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量子计算的时间域X射线吸收光谱（XAS）算法，通过多项优化显著降低了计算资源需求，并验证了其在模拟电池材料中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAS技术提取氧化态信息需要昂贵且耗时的模拟，量子计算提供了一种潜在的加速方案。

Method: 采用乘积公式、压缩双因子化哈密顿量表示、优化采样分布等三项关键优化，显著减少Trotter步骤和逻辑量子比特需求。

Result: 在模拟Li₄Mn₂O团簇系统时，仅需100个逻辑量子比特和少于4×10⁸ T门，且重建光谱与经典计算结果一致。

Conclusion: 该算法在容错量子设备上具有低成本优势，有望加速高容量电池阴极的开发。

Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a leading technique for understanding
structural changes in advanced battery materials such as lithium-excess
cathodes. However, extracting critical information like oxidation states from
the experimental spectra requires expensive and time-consuming simulations.
Building upon a recent proposal to simulate XAS using quantum computers, this
work proposes a highly-optimized implementation of the time-domain algorithm
for X-ray absorption. Among a host of improvements to Hamiltonian
representation, circuit implementation, and measurement strategies, three
optimizations are key to the efficiency of the algorithm. The first is the use
of product formulas with the compressed double factorized form of the
Hamiltonian. The second is recognizing that for spectroscopy applications, it
is sufficient to control the error in the eigenvalues of the (approximate)
Hamiltonian being implemented by the product formula, rather than the generic
error on the full time evolution operator. Using perturbation theory to
estimate this eigenvalue error, we find that significantly fewer Trotter steps
are needed than expected from the time evolution error bound. The third is the
choice of an optimized distribution of samples that takes advantage of the
exponentially decaying Lorentzian kernel. Through constant factor resource
estimates, we show that a challenging model Li$_4$Mn$_2$O cluster system with
18 spatial orbitals and 22 electrons in the active space can be simulated with
100 logical qubits and less than $4 \times 10^8$ T gates per circuit. Finally,
the algorithm is implemented on a simulator, and the reconstructed spectrum is
verified against a classical computational reference. The low cost of our
algorithm makes it attractive to use on fault-tolerant quantum devices to
accelerate the development and commercialization of high-capacity battery
cathodes.

### [5] [Theory and Experimental Demonstration of Quantum Invariant Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15805)
*Loris Maria Cangemi,Yoav Woldiger,Amikam Levy,Assaf Hamo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为量子不变滤波（QIF）的新方法，通过频域设计实现量子控制，显著提升了噪声抑制和相干时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子控制协议通常在时域设计，而频域行为是事后产生的。本文旨在通过频域设计直接实现目标滤波效果。

Method: 利用动态不变框架，从目标频域滤波器推导出连续驱动场，实现量子比特的特定频谱响应。

Result: 在金刚石中的氮空位中心实验中，QIF实现了高保真度的通带、噪声抑制和毫秒级相干时间，比传统方法长两个数量级，且对驱动幅度误差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: QIF为量子控制和传感提供了广泛适用的框架，适用于超导量子比特、囚禁离子和核磁共振系统等多种平台。

Abstract: Quantum control protocols are typically devised in the time domain, leaving
their spectral behavior to emerge only a posteriori. Here, we invert this
paradigm. Starting from a target frequency-domain filter, we employ the
dynamical-invariant framework to derive the continuous driving fields that
enact the chosen spectral response on a qubit. This approach, Quantum Invariant
Filtering (QIF), maps arbitrary finite-impulse responses, including multi-band
and phase-sensitive profiles, into experimentally feasible Hamiltonian
modulations. Implemented on a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, the
method realizes the prescribed passbands with high fidelity, suppresses noise,
and preserves coherence for milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer than
Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequences, while remaining robust to 50%
drive-amplitude errors. Our results establish QIF as a broadly applicable
framework for enhanced quantum control and sensing across diverse physical
platforms, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and nuclear magnetic
resonance systems.

Result: 验证了在现有实验系统中实现少模光子三重态生成的可行性。

Conclusion: 这是光子三重态源在量子技术中实用化的重要一步。

Abstract: Photon triplet sources exhibit non-Gaussian features, a key property for
applications in quantum computing and quantum information. However, spectral
correlations can limit the performance and detection efficiency of these
systems. Motivated by this, we present a theoretical analysis of the spectral
correlations of photon triplets generated through spontaneous third-order
parametric down-conversion in photonic devices, and discuss strategies to
quantify and minimize them. We propose two strategies to minimize spectral
correlations: dispersion engineering in waveguides and pump engineering in
resonators. We apply these strategies in two realistic source designs, namely a
high-index-contrast optical fiber taper and a silicon nitride microring
resonator. Finally, we discuss detection strategies for probing non-Gaussian
features of the triplet state. We find that it is feasible to achieve few-mode
generation of photon triplets using state-of-the-art experimental systems, a
crucial step toward practical applications of photon triplet sources in quantum
technologies.

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了实验复杂度，适用于高维量子态的高效重构。

Abstract: We present a quantum state tomography method that enables the reconstruction
of \emph{arbitrary} $d-$dimensional quantum states encoded in the discretized
transverse momentum of photons, by using \emph{only} $d+1$ experimental
settings. To this end, we identify a family of bases with the property that the
outcomes of a projective measurement are \emph{spatially multiplexed} on the
interference pattern of the projected state. Using the proposed scheme we
performed, as a proof-of-principle, an experimental reconstruction of
$d=6-$dimensional states, for which a complete set of mutually unbiased bases
does not exist. We obtained fidelity values above 0.97 for both pure and mixed
states, reducing the number of experimental settings from $42$ to only $7$.

Conclusion: 论文不仅反驳了早期结论，还提供了工具箱以识别多种横向门，为容错量子计算提供了新思路。

Abstract: Transversal gates are the ideal gates in a fault-tolerant scenario;
relatively easy to implement, and minimally error propagating. Their
availability will maximise fault tolerant thresholds, enabling universal
quantum computation in a wider range of noisy hardware.
  Transversal gates in quantum low density parity check (qLDPC) codes are
largely unstudied, with the early results of Burton & Browne suggesting that
transversal non-Clifford gates may be impossible. In this paper, we contradict
this expectation with constructions for both hypergraph product codes and
balanced product codes, although these first examples have weak properties. We
find qLDPC codes with transversal phase gates that have a number of logical
qubits that grows linearly with $n$, the number of physical qubits. The
distance is highly asymmetric; while the distance against bit flip errors also
grows (almost) linearly in $n$, the distance against phase flip errors is
limited to $O(1)$. Moreover, existing distance rebalancing techniques are
one-sided; we show that they only preserve the transversality when rebalancing
to increase the asymmetry, not decrease it.
  We also collate a toolbox of techniques that identify a single transversal
gate from which we can individuate a large range of different transversal
gates. This is critical when addressing the question of what a transversal
phase gate truly means when there are many logical qubits in the system.

Motivation: 探讨热平衡与量子动力学之间的统一视角，以量子比特为基础模型，揭示两者之间的深层联系。

Method: 通过分析Loschmidt振幅的零点及其与热分配函数零点的类比，结合Cauchy-Riemann方程，建立高温比热与早期时间演化的对应关系。

Result: 发现Loschmidt振幅的零点编码了动力学特征（如正交性、速率函数奇点、量子速度极限），并建立了比热与时间演化的联系。

Conclusion: 研究为理解热平衡与量子动力学的统一提供了新视角，并通过简单模型扩展到相互作用自旋链，展示了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: This work presents a unified perspective on thermal equilibrium and quantum
dynamics by examining the simplest quantum system, a qubit, as a foundational
model. We show that both the thermal partition function and the Loschmidt
amplitude can be understood as extensions of a single analytic function along
different paths in the complex plane. The zeros of Loschmidt amplitude encode
dynamical features such as orthogonality, rate function singularities, and
quantum speed limits, in analogy with the role of partition function zeros in
equilibrium statistical mechanics. We further establish, through the
Cauchy-Riemann equations, that the high-temperature specific heat corresponds
to early-time evolution. The discussion follows a pedagogical progression from
a single qubit to an interacting spin chain.

Result: 在12量子位案例中，门数从4095降至392，深度从2048降至6，错误率从25.86%降至1.64%。

Conclusion: 量子电路可以结合经典VLSI技术，有效解决当前量子设计限制。

Abstract: Prior studies have largely focused on quantum algorithms, often reducing
parallel computing designs to abstract models or overly simplified circuits.
This has contributed to the misconception that most applications are feasible
only through VLSI circuits and cannot be implemented using quantum circuits. To
challenge this view, we present a mixed-signal quantum circuit framework
incorporating three novel methods that reduce circuit complexity and improve
noise tolerance. In a 12 qubit case study comparing our design with JP Morgan's
option pricing circuit, we reduced the gate count from 4095 to 392, depth from
2048 to 6, and error rate from 25.86\% to 1.64\%. Our design combines analog
simplicity with digital flexibility and synthesizability, demonstrating that
quantum circuits can effectively leverage classical VLSI techniques, such as
those enabled by Synopsys Design Compiler to address current quantum design
limitations.

Abstract: We propose a robust approach to spin squeezing with local interactions that
approaches the Heisenberg limit of phase sensitivity. To generate the requisite
entanglement, we generalize the paradigmatic two-axis countertwisting
Hamiltonian -- akin to squeezing by parametric amplification -- to systems with
power-law interactions, incorporating a Heisenberg coupling that aids in
spreading correlations and protects the collective spin coherence. The
resulting time to approach the Heisenberg limit scales sublinearly with
particle number in 2D dipolar and 3D van der Waals interacting systems. Our
protocol is robust to disorder and density fluctuations, and can be implemented
in near-term experiments with molecules, Rydberg atoms, and solid-state spins.

Result: 发现控制效果与记忆效应强度之间存在上下界关系，且在特定条件下控制效果与记忆效应强度成正比。

Conclusion: 研究结果为动态解耦控制中的记忆效应提供了新的定量关系，对量子控制有重要意义。

Abstract: We establish a simple quantitative relationship between the environmental
memory effects and the characteristics in a dynamical decoupling process. In
contrast to previous works, our measures of non-Markovianity are tailored and
extended to evaluate the strength of memory effects in dynamical decoupling. We
find that if each kick commutes with the dynamical map of the uncontrolled
system, then the change of the final dynamical map or the final state brought
by the control (called the "effect of control") is upper (lower) bounded by the
summation (difference) of the strengths of memory effects with and without
control. Our finding is illustrated with a dissipative quantum Rabi model by
numerical simulations where one or many cycles of parity kicks are implemented
on the qubit. Besides, the results show that under certain conditions, the
effect of control or the increase of performance by the control may be simply
proportional to the strength of memory effects with or without control.

Abstract: An open quantum system leaks information into its environment. In some
circumstances it is possible for an observer, say Alice, to recover that
information, as a classical measurement record, in a variety of different ways,
using different experimental setups. The optimal way for Alice to estimate the
quantum state at time $t$ from the record before $t$ is known as quantum
filtering. Recently, a version of quantum smoothing, in which Alice estimates
the state at time $t$ using her record on both sides of $t$, has been
developed. It requires Alice to make optimal inferences about the pre-$t$
record of a second observer, say Bob, who recovers whatever information Alice
does not. But for Alice to make this inference, she needs to know Bob's setup.
In this paper we consider what happens if Alice is mistaken in her assumption
about Bob's setup. We show that the accuracy -- as measured by the
Trace-Squared-Deviation, of Alice's estimate of the true state (i.e., the state
conditioned on her and Bob's pre-$t$ records) -- depends strongly on her setup,
Bob's actual setup, and the wrongly assumed setup. Using resonance fluorescence
as a model system, we show numerically that in some cases the wrong smoothing
is almost as accurate as the right smoothing, but in other cases much less
accurate, even being less accurate than Alice's filtered estimate. Curiously,
in some of the latter cases the fidelity of Alice's wrong estimate with the
true state is actually higher than that of her right estimate. We explain this,
and other features we observe numerically, by some simple analytical arguments.

Conclusion: 子线性深度的电路无法实现近似设计，且在某些群中，存在常数分离的深度和门数限制。

Abstract: Constructing ensembles of circuits which efficiently approximate the Haar
measure over various groups is a long-standing and fundamental problem in
quantum information theory. Recently it was shown that one can obtain
approximate designs over the unitary group with depths scaling logarithmically
in the number of qubits, but that no sublinear-depth approximate designs exist
over the orthogonal group. Here we derive, for any group $G$ possessing an
invariant state $G^{\otimes k} \lvert\Psi\rangle= \lvert\Psi\rangle$, a lower
bound on the diamond distance between the $k$\textsuperscript{th} moment
operator of any ensemble of elements of $G$, and that of the Haar measure over
$G$. We then use this bound to prove that for many groups of interest, no
subset of $G$ consisting of sublinear-depth one-dimensional circuits with local
gates can form an approximate $k$-design over $G$. More generally, on a
$D$-dimensional lattice, our results imply that such group designs require
depths scaling at least as $n^{1/D}$. Moreover, for most of the groups we
consider we find that such ensembles can, with high probability, be
distinguished from $k$-designs by a single shot of a constant-depth
measurement. Among other examples, we show that there is a constant separation
between (a) the maximum depth and gate count for which no circuit can
approximate even the second moment of random matchgate circuits, and (b) the
depth and gate count required to implement the matchgate Haar distribution
exactly. We furthermore rule out the existence of sublinear-depth $8$-designs
over the Clifford group. Finally, we relax the assumption of working with local
gates, and prove the impossibility of obtaining approximate designs over $G$
using any circuit comprised of a sublinear number of gates generated by Pauli
strings.

Abstract: The recently proposed Clifford augmented density matrix renormalization group

states, and takes advantage of the expression power from both. CA-DMRG has been
shown to be able to achieve higher accuracy than standard DMRG on commonly used

Abstract: The quantum Rabi model (QRM), composed of a qubit interacting with a
quantized photonic field, is a cornerstone of quantum optics. The QRM with
dominant unitary dynamics has been demonstrated in circuit quantum
electrodynamics (QED) systems, but an open QRM with a strong photonic
dissipation has not been experimentally explored. We here present the first
experimental demonstration of such an open system in circuit QED, featuring a
controlled competition between the coherent qubit-field interaction and the
photonic dissipation. We map out the photon number distributions of the
dissipative resonator for different coupling strengths in the steady state. We
further observe the variation of the photon number during the system's
evolution toward the steady state with fixed control parameters. The results
demonstrate that the system's behavior is significantly modified by photonic
dissipation.

Abstract: We rigorously analyze the global tripartite entanglement in a Heisenberg
trimer with mixed spins-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) under varying exchange couplings
between dissimilar and identical spins, magnetic fields, and temperatures. The
global tripartite entanglement is quantified using the geometric mean of all
three bipartite contributions, evaluated through negativity. We precisely map
the regions of parameter space in which the trimer system exhibits spontaneous
global entanglement. In addition, we classify the nature of the tripartite
entangled states based on the distribution of reduced bipartite negativities
among the spin dimers in the trimer. We further examine the thermal stability
of global tripartite entanglement throughout the full parameter space. Special
attention is given to the theoretical prediction of thermal robustness in a
real three-spin complex, [Ni(bapa)(H$_2$0)]$_2$Cu(pba)(ClO$_4$)$_2$, where bapa
stands for bis($3$-aminopropyl)amine, and pba denotes
$1$,$3$-propylenebis(oxamato), which serves as an experimental realization of
the mixed-spin ($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer. Notably, global entanglement
in this system is predicted to persist up to approximately $100$ K and magnetic
fields approaching $210$ T. Moreover, we uncover a thermally induced activation
of robust global entanglement in regions where the ground state is biseparable.
The magnitude of this thermal entanglement is remarkably high, nearly reaching
a value of $1/2$, which has not been reported before. Finally, we propose a
connection between the theoretically predicted tripartite entanglement,
quantified via negativity derived from the density matrix, and the quantities
measured directly or indirectly from various experiments.

Abstract: Single-shot high-resolution spectroscopy at the single-photon-level has
emerged as a promising measurement technique, enabling novel observations and
evaluations that were previously challenging. This technology is particularly
effective for spectroscopic applications aimed at realizing
frequency-multiplexed quantum repeaters. In this study, we propose a
single-shot high-resolution single-photon spectroscopy system that integrates
high-resolution frequency-to-spatial mode mapping using a virtually imaged
phased-array (VIPA) and high-precision spatial mode detection using a
single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array. We experimentally demonstrated the
principle of this system using weak coherent pulses with a frequency mode
interval of 120 MHz. This interval closely matches the minimum frequency mode
spacing of the atomic frequency comb quantum memory with the
$Pr^{3+}$-ion-doped $Y_{2}SiO_{5}$ crystal. By applying the proposed system, we
expect to maximize the multiplexing capability of frequency-multiplexed quantum
repeater schemes utilizing such quantum memories.

Method: 采用三种量化方法（广义三体负性、CKW单配关系、几何平均完全三分）分析零温与非零温下的纠缠。

Conclusion: 真实四体纠缠在反铁磁耦合下稳定，但在特定参数范围内量化方法存在局限性，需进一步研究。

Abstract: The genuine tetrapartite entanglement of a mixed spin-(1/2,1) Heisenberg
tetramer is quantified according to the three different approaches incorporated
all seven global bisections existing within the tetrapartite system. The degree
of entanglement of each bisection is evaluated through the bipartite negativity
at zero and non-zero temperature taking into account ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic type of intra- ($J$) and inter-dimer ($J_1$) exchange
coupling inside the square plaquette. Three utilized quantification methods
based on the generalization of (i) a genuine tripartite negativity, (ii) a
Coffman, Kundu and Wootters monogamy relation and (iii) a geometric average of
complete trisections, result to the qualitatively and almost quantitatively
identical behavior of a genuine tetrapartite negativity. It is shown that the
genuine tetrapartite negativity exclusively arises from the
antiferromagnetic-inter dimer $J_1>0$ coupling, whereas the character of with
respect to $J$ ($J>0$ or $J<0$) determines its zero-temperature magnitude and
its thermal stability with respect to the magnetic field and temperature. As is
demonstrated for $0<J_1/J<1$ the genuine tetrapartite negativity is
dramatically reduced due to the preference of magnetic arrangement involving
two separable mixed spin-(1/2,1) dimers. In an opposite limit the genuine
tetrapartite negativity is significantly stable with a threshold temperature
proportional to the strength of an inter-dimer coupling $J_1$. It is found,
that all three quantification procedures are insufficient to correctly describe
the genuine tetrapartite negativity in a specific part of the parameter space
with absence of relevant dimer separable states. Finally, the thermal stability
of a genuine tetrapartite negativity is discussed in detail for selected
geometries motivated by the real tetranuclear bimetallic complexes with a
Cu$_2$Ni$_2$ magnetic core.

Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a promising approach to the decoding
problem of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), but have observed consistent
difficulty when generalising performance to larger QEC codes. Recent
scalability-focused approaches have split the decoding workload by using local
ANNs to perform initial syndrome processing and leaving final processing to a
global residual decoder. We investigated ANN surface code decoding under a
scheme exploiting the spatiotemporal structure of syndrome data. In particular,
we present a vectorised method for surface code data simulation and benchmark
decoding performance when such data defines a multi-label classification
problem and generative modelling problem for rotated surface codes with circuit
noise after each gate and idle timestep. Performance was found to generalise to
rotated surface codes of sizes up to $d=97$, with depolarisation parameter
thresholds of up to $0.7\%$ achieved, competitive with h Minimum Weight Perfect
Matching
  (MWPM). Improved latencies, compared with MWPM alone, were found starting at
code distances of $d=33$ and $d=89$ under noise models above and below
threshold respectively. These results suggest promising prospects for ANN-based
frameworks for surface code decoding with performance sufficient to support the
demands expected from fault-tolerant resource estimates.

Abstract: The spin qubits of color centers are extensively investigated for quantum
sensing, communication, and information processing, with their states generally
controlled using lasers and microwaves. However, it is challenging to
effectively irradiate both lasers and microwaves onto color centers using small
footprint microwave waveguides or antennas that are compatible with
semiconductor devices. We experimentally show that by introducing a compact
coplanar waveguide with a thin slit in its signal line, effective irradiation
of both lasers and microwaves is enabled, allowing spin-state control of color
centers created around the slit. Microwave magnetic fields parallel to the
surface, intrinsically generated by a standard coplanar waveguide, persist even
after loading the slit, which is necessary to control the color centers whose
spin quantization axes are oriented perpendicular to the surface, while laser
light for the initialization and readout of spin states can access the color
centers through the slit. Continuous and pulsed optically detected magnetic
resonance measurements are performed for the silicon vacancies
($\mathrm{V_{Si}}$) in silicon carbide 4H-SiC(0001). Experimental results
indicate that the spin states of $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$ are effectively controlled
by the microwave magnetic fields parallel to the surface, which agrees with
numerical results from electromagnetic field simulations. Our small footprint
waveguide is suitable for integrating color-center-based quantum sensors into
semiconductor electronic devices and other small-scale systems.

Abstract: The Lindblad equation for open quantum systems is central to our
understanding of coherence and entanglement in the presence of Markovian
dissipation. In closed quantum systems Hilbert-space fragmentation is an
effective mechanism for slowing decoherence in the presence of constrained
interactions. We develop a general mechanism for operator-space fragmentation
of mixed states, undergoing Lindbladian evolution generated by frustration-free
Hamiltonians and Pauli-string jump operators. The interplay of generator
algebras of dissipative and unitary dynamics leads to a hierarchical
partitioning of operator and real space into dynamically disconnected
subspaces, which we elucidate using the bond and commutant algebras of
superoperators. This fragmentation fundamentally constrains information
spreading in open systems and provides new mechanisms to control highly
entangled quantum states and dynamics. Our approach yields two key advances.
Firstly, we introduce frustration graphs in operator space as a compact
representation to construct effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in individual
fragments and diagnose their free-fermion solvability. Secondly, using these
methods we uncover a range of universal dynamical regimes in Pauli-Lindblad
models, exhibiting symmetry enriched quantum chaos and integrability in
operator-space fragments. Furthermore, we show dissipation-driven phase
transitions corresponding to exceptional points in the Lindbladian spectrum
whose signatures are captured by spectral statistics and operator dynamics.
These results establish operator-space fragmentation as a fundamental principle
for open quantum systems, with immediate implications for quantum error
correction, where protected subspaces could emerge naturally from
fragmentation. Our framework provides a systematic approach to discover and
characterize novel non-equilibrium phases in open quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Quantum physics with its unique features enables parameter estimation with
precisions beyond the capability of classical sensors, a phenomenon known as
quantum-enhanced sensing. Quantum criticality has been identified as a resource
for achieving such an enhancement. Despite immense theoretical progress in
characterizing criticality-enhanced sensing, experimental implementations of
such systems have been extremely challenging. This is due to the complexity of
ground-state preparation and the long time required to reach the steady state
near the critical points. Here we experimentally demonstrate
criticality-enhanced quantum sensitivity in a non-Hermitian topological system.
Our photonic quantum walk setup supports two distinct topological phase
transitions at which quantum-enhanced sensitivity is observed even at the
transient times, where the system has not yet reached its steady state. Indeed,
our theoretical analysis shows that the detected enhancement is a direct
implication of the steady-state behavior. The merit of our setup is also
captured through Bayesian inference which shows excellent estimation and
precision. Our experiment showcases the leveraging of quantum criticality and
non-Hermitian physics for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity.

Abstract: Optical technology emerges as a highly promising platform for quantum
computing, driven by its enormous potential for large-scale ultrafast
computation and its integration with telecom technology. There have been
intensive investigations ongoing into the development of optical quantum
computers, however, they are limited to small-scale, special-purpose, or
low-quality systems. Error correction for fault tolerance is still very
challenging, making a full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer a long-term
goal. However, practical testbeds for quantum computers, without the difficulty
in error correction, are in high demand. Here we present an innovative analog
optical quantum computer utilising continuous variables. Our analog optical
quantum computer is based on sequential measurements of time-domain-multiplexed
large-scale two-dimensional entanglement. Accumulated Gaussian noise and
spurious bias caused by the imperfection of analog computing can be suppressed
through careful calibration and repeated trials without complicated error
correction. Our system achieves a hundred analog inputs and operates at a clock
frequency of 100 MHz with a comprehensive full-stack architecture featuring a
cloud interface and a Python software development kit (SDK) for enhanced
accessibility and scalability. We demonstrate the detailed characterisation of
our optical quantum computer and quantum state sorting as its example
application. This development marks a significant step forward in the
exploration of analog quantum computing, with a potential to accelerate both
fundamental research and practical applications such as fast and large-scale

Motivation: DE-FGs在量子信息处理中具有重要性，但其分割函数的近似计算比标准因子图（S-FGs）更复杂，需要新的理论支持。

Method: 通过扩展环演算变换（LCT）并应用于满足特定条件的DE-FGs，提出了基于有限图覆盖的组合特征化方法。

Result: 数值结果支持了Bethe分割函数的组合特征化在更广泛的DE-FGs中成立的猜想。

Conclusion: 本文为DE-FGs的Bethe分割函数提供了新的理论工具，并扩展了LCT的应用范围。

Abstract: For standard factor graphs (S-FGs) with non-negative real-valued local
functions, Vontobel provided a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe
approximation of the partition function, also known as the Bethe partition
function, using finite graph covers. The proof of this characterization, i.e.,
the graph-cover theorem for S-FGs, heavily relied on the method of types.
  In this paper, we study double-edge factor graphs (DE-FGs), a class of factor
graphs where each local function takes complex values and satisfies some
positive semi-definiteness constraints. DE-FGs and their partition functions
are particularly relevant for quantum information processing. Approximating the
partition function of a DE-FG is more difficult than for an S-FG, as it
involves summing complex values instead of non-negative real values. We develop
the sum-product algorithm (SPA) fixed-point-based Bethe approximation of the
partition function. However, one cannot directly apply the method of types to
prove a similar combinatorial characterization as in the case of S-FGs.
  We provide a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe partition function
in terms of finite graph covers for a class of DE-FGs that satisfy a specific,
easily checkable condition. Towards proving this characterization, we apply a
suitable loop-calculus transform (LCT) to these graphs. Originally, the LCT was
introduced by Chertkov and Chernyak as a special linear transform for S-FGs and
later extended by Mori. Our proposed LCT is applicable for both DE-FGs and
S-FGs and generalizes prior versions by handling zero-valued SPA fixed-point
message components, which are common in DE-FGs.
  Supported by numerical results, we conjecture that this combinatorial
characterization of the Bethe partition function in terms of finite graph
covers holds more broadly for DE-FGs.

Abstract: An optomechanical system based on two optical modes, one of which is pumped
by a coherent wave, interacting with each other via a phonon mode is
considered. In such a system, a hard excitation mode can be realized in the
region of bistability. It is demonstrated that excitation of an optical mode
with a lower frequency by a low-intensity seed wave can lead to a significant
reduction of a threshold of the hard excitation mode. This decrease is due to
the fact that the seed wave changes the stability of solutions in the
bistability region. This leads to the fact that switching from a non-generating
state to a generating one occurs at lower values of the intensity of the pump
wave. The obtained result paves the way for the creation of all-optical

Motivation: 探讨不同耦合过程如何影响双玻色模式系统的相关性，尤其是线性和非线性耦合的差异。

Method: 将耦合过程视为高斯过程，模式因与独立压缩真空耦合而经历阻尼和波动，分析不同耦合条件下相关性的生成。

Result: 线性耦合仅在模式间存在差异时生成相关性，而非线性耦合不受模式差异影响；强耦合下线性耦合会破坏相关性，而非线性耦合使模式完全相干。

Conclusion: 线性和非线性耦合在相关性生成和破坏机制上截然不同，为理解多模式系统的耦合效应提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study the influence of the linear and nonlinear coupling processes on the
correlation properties of a system composed of two bosonic modes. The coupling
processes are treated as Gaussian while the modes are assumed to experience
damping and fluctuations that are due to their coupling to independent squeezed
vacua. We investigate under what circumstances a given type of coupling causes
the creation of the first-order correlations and which causes the creation of
the two-photon correlations. Distinctly different results are obtained for the
linear and nonlinear couplings, especially when there are two-photon
correlations present in the modes. In particular, the linear coupling process
can generate the inter-mode correlations only when there are differences
between the modes either in populations or two-photon correlations. The varying
with the coupling strength a population difference is shown to be responsible
for generation of the first-order correlations while the varying asymmetry in
the two-photon correlations is found to be responsible for the generation of
the inter-mode two-photon correlations. In the case of the nonlinear coupling
the generation of the inter-mode correlations is insensitive to any difference
between the modes. The varying with the coupling strength amplification of the
population of the modes is found to be responsible for generation of the
inter-mode two photon correlations while the varying amplification of the
two-photon correlations results in the first-order correlations between the
modes. Furthermore, in the strong coupling limit the linear coupling tends to
destroy all of the inter-mode correlations, and simultaneously turns the states
of the modes to be identical, either thermal or equally squeezed states. In the
case of nonlinear coupling process the modes are turned to be perfectly
coherent.

Abstract: Space complexity is a key field of study in theoretical computer science. In
the quantum setting there are clear motivations to understand the power of
space-restricted computation, as qubits are an especially precious and limited
resource.
  Recently, a new branch of space-bounded complexity called catalytic computing
has shown that reusing space is a very powerful computational resource,
especially for subroutines that incur little to no space overhead. While
quantum catalysis in an information theoretic context, and the power of
``dirty'' qubits for quantum computation, has been studied over the years,
these models are generally not suitable for use in quantum space-bounded
algorithms, as they either rely on specific catalytic states or destroy the
memory being borrowed.
  We define the notion of catalytic computing in the quantum setting and show a
number of initial results about the model. First, we show that quantum
catalytic logspace can always be computed quantumly in polynomial time; the
classical analogue of this is the largest open question in catalytic computing.
This also allows quantum catalytic space to be defined in an equivalent way
with respect to circuits instead of Turing machines. We also prove that quantum
catalytic logspace can simulate log-depth threshold circuits, a class which is
known to contain (and believed to strictly contain) quantum logspace, thus
showcasing the power of quantum catalytic space. Finally we show that both
unitary quantum catalytic logspace and classical catalytic logspace can be
simulated in the one-clean qubit model.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing uses the dynamics of quantum systems to process
temporal data, making it particularly well-suited for learning with noisy
intermediate-scale quantum devices. Early experimental proposals, such as the
restarting and rewinding protocols, relied on repeating previous steps of the
quantum map to avoid backaction. However, this approach compromises real-time
processing and increases computational overhead. Recent developments have
introduced alternative protocols that address these limitations. These include
online, mid-circuit measurement, and feedback techniques, which enable
real-time computation while preserving the input history. Among these, the
feedback protocol stands out for its ability to process temporal information
with comparatively fewer components. Despite this potential advantage, the
theoretical foundations of feedback-based quantum reservoir computing remain
underdeveloped, particularly with regard to the universality and the
approximation capabilities of this approach. This paper addresses this issue by
presenting a recurrent quantum neural network architecture that extends a class
of existing feedforward models to a dynamic, feedback-driven reservoir setting.
We provide theoretical guarantees for variational recurrent quantum neural
networks, including approximation bounds and universality results. Notably, our
analysis demonstrates that the model is universal with linear readouts, making
it both powerful and experimentally accessible. These results pave the way for
practical and theoretically grounded quantum reservoir computing with real-time
processing capabilities.

Abstract: Quantum interference and entanglement are in the core of quantum
computations. The fast spread of information in the quantum circuit helps to
mitigate the circuit depth. Although the information scrambling in the closed
systems has been proposed and tested in the digital circuits, how to measure
the evolution of quantum correlations between systems and environments remains
a delicate and open question. Here, we propose a photonic circuit to
investigate the information scrambling in an open quantum system by
implementing the collision model with cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers. We
numerically simulate the photon propagation and find that the tripartite mutual
information strongly depends on the system-environment and
environment-environment interactions. We further reduce the number of
observables and the number of shots required to reconstruct the density matrix
by designing an enhanced compressed sensing. Our results provide a
reconfigurable photonic platform for simulating open quantum systems and pave
the way for exploring controllable dissipation and non-Markovianity in
discrete-variable photonic computing.

Abstract: Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors,
which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We
study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems
with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly.
Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate
its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and
numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation
values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the
Lieb-Robinson bound. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability
extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results
support the robustness of analogue simulation platforms for long-range models,
and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can
be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.

Abstract: Levitodynamics, i.e., the levitation of objects of mesoscopic size has made
huge progress in the last decade, giving rise to new experimental opportunities
for instance in materials science, but also allowing to address questions of
fundamental physics for the first time. It has become possible to cool a
levitated particle of mesoscopic size down to its motional ground state and to
observe its motion driven by quantum fluctuations. Such an experiment is
ideally suited for an analysis within the stochastic mechanics approach to
quantum mechanics, which allows for a dynamic description of individual
particle paths. We show that within our approach we reproduce the findings of a
recent experiment [Magrini et al., Nature 595-373-377 (2021)]. The phase space
dynamics reported there based on a quantum optimal control using Kalman
filtering can be understood using the concept of coherent states.

Abstract: We describe a general quantum receiver protocol that maps
laser-light-modulated classical communications signals into quantum processors
for decoding with quantum logic. The quantum logic enables joint quantum
measurements over a codeword. These joint measurements are needed to achieve
the quantum limit of communications capacity. Our receiver design requires only
logarithmically increasing qubit resources with the size of the codeword and
accommodates practically relevant coherent-state modulation containing multiple
photons per pulse. Focusing on classical-quantum polar codes, we outline the
necessary quality of quantum operations and codeword lengths to demonstrate a
quantum processing-enhanced communications rate surpassing that of any known
classical optical receiver-decoder pair. Specifically, we show that a small
quantum receiver of 4 qubits with loss rates of $\sim 2\%$ and quantum gate
errors of $\sim 0.02\%$ can provide a $10$ percent gain in the communications
rate in the weak signal limit. Additionally, we outline a possible hardware
implementation of the receiver based on efficient spin-photon interfaces such
as cavity-coupled diamond color centers or atomic qubits for which the required
functionality has been experimentally verified, although not at the required
error levels.

Abstract: For the simple system of a point-like particle in the real line I compile and
contrast, starting with a concise table, the structural elements of quantum
mechanics with those of classical (statistical) mechanics. Despite many amazing
similarities, there are the well-known fundamental differences. The basic
reason for all of them is the algebraic non-commutativity in the quantal
structure. It was discovered by Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) in June 1925 on
the small island of Helgoland in the North Sea, as a consequence of his success
at understanding atomic spectral data within a matrix scheme which is
consistent with energy conservation. I discuss the differences and exemplify
quantifications of them by the variance and entropic indeterminacy
inequalities, by (pseudo-)classical bounds on quantum canonical partition
functions, and by the correlation inequalities of John Bell (1928-1990) and
others.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators have provided key insights into quantum many-body
dynamics. However, in such systems, both coherent and incoherent errors limit
their scalability, hindering simulations in regimes that challenge classical
simulations. In this work, we introduce an error mitigation technique that
addresses and effectively suppresses a key source of error in leading simulator
platforms: shot-to-shot fluctuations in the parameters for the Hamiltonian
governing the system dynamics. We rigorously prove that amplifying this
shot-to-shot noise and extrapolating to the zero-noise limit recovers noiseless
results for realistic noise distributions. Experimentally, we demonstrate this
technique on a 27-ion trapped-ion quantum simulator, extending the two-qubit
exchange oscillation lifetime threefold. Numerically, we predict a significant
enhancement in the effective many-body coherence time for Rydberg atom arrays
under realistic conditions. Our scheme provides a possible route towards
extending the effective coherence time in analog quantum experiments, enabling
deeper explorations of quantum many-body dynamics.

Abstract: The physics of a quantum system with many degrees of freedom is often
approximated by downfolding: most of the degrees of freedom are "folded into" a
much smaller number of degrees of freedom, resulting in an effective
Hamiltonian that still captures the essential physics. Approaches of this sort
are particularly relevant for quantum information, where exact downfolding
would allow eigenstates in a large Hilbert space to be simulated with fewer
qubits. Very little work has been done to prove the existence of such an exact
downfolding for general systems or even particular cases. In this letter we
prove that exact quantum downfolding is impossible for what is perhaps the most
commonly-used formulation of the task. Specifically, for a non-trivial
Hamiltonian $\mathbf{H}(x)\equiv\mathbf{A}+x\mathbf{B}$ that depends on some
parameter $x$ (e.g. an electric field, bond length or interaction strength) it
is not possible to construct a lower-dimension effective Hamiltonian
$\mathbf{h}(x)\equiv\mathbf{a}+x\mathbf{b}$ that exactly recovers \emph{any} of
the eigenvalue functions $E_i(x)$ of $\mathbf{H}(x)$. We discuss several
generalizations of this result and the impacts of these findings on future
directions in quantum information.

Abstract: Adiabaticity is a cornerstone of many promising approaches to quantum
control, computing, and simulation. In practice, however, there is always a
trade-off. Although the deleterious effects of noise can be diminished by
running a control schedule more quickly, this benefit comes at the expense of
nonadiabaticity. To put these two unwanted effects on the same theoretical
footing, we analyze the nonadiabatic error in qubit control as a form of
entropy production, examining the mechanism by which fine-grained information
is effectively lost despite the dynamics being fundamentally unitary. A crucial
issue here is the question of how to define equilibrium under a time-dependent
Hamiltonian. Using the Landau--Zener protocol as a test case, we show that
entropy increases nearly monotonically when equilibrium is defined with respect
to the effective Hamiltonian in the optimal superadiabatic frame. We then
consider single-passage Landau--Zener--St\"{u}ckelberg--Majorana
interferometry, in which the initial state of the qubit is arbitrary.
Violations of the second law of thermodynamics are possible but require
exquisite control to achieve deliberately.

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of multiple two-level atoms (qubits) in a
waveguide quantum electrodynamics system, with a focus on modified
superradiance effects between two or four atoms with finite delay times. Using
a numerically exact matrix product approach, we explore both Markovian and
non-Markovian regimes, and highlight the significant influence of time-delayed
feedback effects and the clear breakdown of assuming instantaneous coupling
dynamics. We first show a system composed of two spatially separated qubits,
prepared in a doubly excited state (both fully excited), and provide a
comprehensive study of how delayed feedback influences the collective system
decay rates, as well as the quantum correlations between waveguide photons,
atoms, and between atom and photons. The system is then extended to include two
additional qubits located next to the initial ones (four qubits in total), and
we demonstrate, by manipulating the initial excitations and the time-delay
effects, how long-term quantum correlations and light-matter entangled states
can be established.

Abstract: As quantum computing matures and moves toward broader accessibility through
cloud-based platforms, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of quantum
computations becomes an urgent concern. In this work, we propose a strategy to
leverage the byproducts of quantum error correction (QEC) to verify hardware
identity and authenticate quantum computations for ``free'', without
introducing any additional quantum computations or measurements. By treating
syndrome measurements as a source of metadata, we embed verification seamlessly
into standard QEC protocols and eliminate the need for separate
challenge-response pairs. We validate our approach using multiple
error-correcting codes, quantum states, and circuit compilation strategies on
several generations of IBM quantum computers. Our classifiers achieve 99\%
accuracy with only 500 shots in distinguishing among five backends. Overall, we
re-purpose the intrinsic overhead of error correction to be a mechanism for
securing quantum computation.

Abstract: Existing quantum state tomography methods are limited in scalability due to
their high computation and memory demands, making them impractical for recovery
of large quantum states. In this work, we address these limitations by
reformulating the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem using the
Burer-Monteiro factorization, resulting in a non-convex but low-rank
parameterization of the density matrix. We derive a fully unconstrained
formulation by analytically eliminating the trace-one and positive semidefinite
constraints, thereby avoiding the need for projection steps during
optimization. Furthermore, we determine the Lagrange multiplier associated with
the unit-trace constraint a priori, reducing computational overhead. The
resulting formulation is amenable to scalable first-order optimization, and we
demonstrate its tractability using limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS). Importantly,
we also propose a low-memory version of the above algorithm to fully recover
certain large quantum states with Pauli-based POVM measurements. Our low-memory
algorithm avoids explicitly forming any density matrix, and does not require
the density matrix to have a matrix product state (MPS) or other tensor
structure. For a fixed number of measurements and fixed rank, our algorithm
requires just $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ complexity per iteration to recover a $d
\times d$ density matrix. Additionally, we derive a useful error bound that can
be used to give a rigorous termination criterion. We numerically demonstrate
that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms for moderately
sized problems, and then demonstrate that our method can solve a 20-qubit
problem on a laptop in under 5 hours.

Abstract: Quantum random access memory (QRAM) enables efficient classical data access
for quantum computers -- a prerequisite for many quantum algorithms to achieve
quantum speedup. Despite various proposals, the experimental realization of
QRAM remains largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally investigate the
circuit-based bucket-brigade QRAM with a superconducting quantum processor. To
facilitate the experimental implementation, we introduce a hardware-efficient
gate decomposition scheme for quantum routers, which effectively reduces the
depth of the QRAM circuit by more than 30% compared to the conventional
controlled-SWAP-based implementation. We further propose an error mitigation
method to boost the QRAM query fidelity. With these techniques, we are able to
experimentally implement the QRAM architectures with two and three layers,
achieving query fidelities up to 0.800 $\pm$ 0.026 and 0.604$\pm$0.005,
respectively. Additionally, we study the error propagation mechanism and the
scalability of our QRAM implementation, providing experimental evidence for the
noise resilience nature of the bucket-brigade QRAM architecture. Our results
highlight the potential of superconducting quantum processors for realizing a
scalable QRAM architecture.

Conclusion: 热噪声路由为光力学网络中的非互易声子传输和机械冷却提供了新思路，适用于复杂热环境。

Abstract: We propose an effective method for cooling two non-degenerate mechanical
resonators by routing thermal noise flow in a four-mode optomechanical
plaquette. The thermal noise flow between the mechanical resonators can be
fully suppressed by addressing the overall loop phase in the plaquette,
irrespective of their thermal temperatures. We find that optimal mechanical
cooling, even down to the ground state, can be realized in this regime. The
thermal noise routing, achieved by dissipation engineering at optomechanical
interfaces, provides a valuable and complementary approach to conventional
coherent dark-mode control theory. It can be generalized to nonreciprocal
control of phonon transport and mechanical cooling, and may find applications
in optomechanical networks with complex thermal environments.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，RSA加密系统基于素数分解的计算难度面临挑战，因此需要探索量子辅助的分解方法。

Method: 通过二进制乘法和进位传播建模，将问题转化为HUBO形式并简化为二次无约束二进制优化形式；同时采用CQM模型，引入约束松弛和全局乘积一致性。

Conclusion: 研究展示了量子辅助分解的潜力与当前限制，为评估RSA在量子时代的安全性奠定了基础。

Abstract: The RSA cryptosystem, which relies on the computational difficulty of prime
factorization, faces growing challenges with the advancement of quantum
computing. In this study, we propose a quantum annealing based approach to
integer factorization using both high order unconstrained binary optimization
(HUBO) and constrained quadratic model (CQM) formulations. We begin by modeling
binary multiplication with explicit carry propagation, translating this into a
HUBO representation and subsequently reducing it to a quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization form compatible with current quantum solvers. To address
scalability limitations, we implement a CQM approach with constraint relaxation
and global product consistency. While the HUBO model successfully factors small
semiprimes, it exhibits exponential memory growth, making it impractical for
inputs larger than 10 bits. In contrast, the CQM model achieves accurate
factorization of semiprimes up to 60 bits including N = 1152921423002469787
demonstrating significantly improved scalability. Experimental results further
show that applying global product constraints enhances factorization accuracy
and consistency across all tested instances. This work highlights both the
promise and current limitations of quantum-assisted factorization and
establishes a foundation for evaluating RSA security in the emerging quantum
era.

Conclusion: 本文不仅提供了NOF模型中量子与经典分离的新结果，还提出了一种新的随机下界证明方法，具有独立意义。

Abstract: Quantum versus classical separation plays a central role in understanding the
advantages of quantum computation. In this paper, we present the first
exponential separation between quantum and bounded-error randomized
communication complexity in a variant of the Number-on-Forehead (NOF) model.
Namely, the three-player Simultaneous Number-on-Forehead model. Specifically,
we introduce the Gadgeted Hidden Matching Problem and show that it can be
solved using only $O(\log n)$ simultaneous quantum communication. In contrast,
any simultaneous randomized protocol requires $\Omega(n^{1/16})$ communication.
  On the technical side, a key obstacle in separating quantum and classical
communication in NOF models is that all known randomized NOF lower bound tools,
such as the discrepancy method, typically apply to both randomized and quantum
protocols. In this regard, our technique provides a new method for proving
randomized lower bounds in the NOF setting and may be of independent interest
beyond the separation result.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了横向ZFS导致的磁场信号不敏感问题，为固态色心在量子传感中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Solid-state color centers embedded in diamond, silicon carbide (SiC) and
other host-matrices offer a promising platform for nanoscale quantum sensing.
Sometimes a relatively strong transverse zero-field splitting (ZFS) is
introduced in a color center due to its local strain and low symmetry of the
host structure. While clock transitions induced by transverse zero-field
splitting (ZFS) serve as a method to prolong the coherence time, the Zeeman
sub-levels of solid-state color centers become insensitive to first-order
magnetic field signals, thereby limiting their utility as magnetometers. In
this work, we address this challenge and achieve wide band AC field detection
spanning from hundreds of kHz to hundreds of MHz by utilizing a combination of
orthogonal microwaves and phase modulation at different frequencies. Our
control method effectively suppresses the system noise and the amplitude
fluctuation of the driving field, which extends the coherence time of the
quantum system.

Abstract: The quest for universal superconducting quantum computing is hindered by
noise and errors. It has been proven that Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes
will lay at the foundation of fault tolerant quantum computing. However,
cosmic-ray induced correlated errors, which are the most detrimental events
that can impact superconducting quantum computers, are yet to be efficiently
tackled. In order to reach fault tolerance, we must also develop radiation
aware methods to complement QEC.
  In this paper, we propose the first algorithm to effectively exploit syndrome
information for the efficient detection of radiation events in superconducting
quantum devices at runtime. We perform a thorough analysis of simulated Rotated
Surface codes injecting over 11 million physics-modeled radiation-induced
faults. We consider the properties of the X and Z check bases, the impact of
code distance, and the decoder's time to solution constraints. Our technique
detects $100\%$ of injected faults, regardless of the impact's position.
Moreover, we accurately identify both the radiation impact centre and the area
affected, with an overhead lower than $0.3\%$ the decoding time. Additionally,
we use the fault identification information to propose a radiation fault
correction technique that improves of up to $20\%$ the output correctness
compared to existing decoders.

Abstract: Starting from a generalization of Weyl's relations in finite dimension $N$,
we show that the Heisenberg commutation relations can be satisfied in a
specific $N-1$ dimensional subspace, and display a linear map for projecting
operators to this subspace. This setup is used to construct a hierarchy of
parameter-dependent commuting matrices in $N$ dimensions. This family of
commuting matrices is then related to Type-1 matrices representing quantum
integrable models. The commuting matrices find an interesting application in
quantum computation, specifically in Grover's database search problem. Each
member of the hierarchy serves as a candidate Hamiltonian for quantum adiabatic
evolution and, in some cases, achieves higher fidelity than standard choices --
thus offering improved performance.

Conclusion: 初始态设计是一种实用且可扩展的相干性控制方法，为高效量子热力学设备的开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Quantum coherence, encoded in the off-diagonal elements of a system's density
matrix, is a key resource in quantum thermodynamics, fundamentally limiting the
maximum extractable work, or ergotropy. While previous experiments have
isolated coherence-related contributions to work extraction, it remains unclear
how coherence can be harnessed in a controllable and energy-efficient manner.
Here, we experimentally investigate the role of initial-state coherence in work
extraction from a superconducting transmon qubit. By preparing a range of pure
states and implementing three complementary extraction protocols, we reveal how
coherence governs the partitioning of ergotropy. We find that the choice of
initial state depends on the dominant decoherence channel-energy relaxation or
dephasing. By further accounting for thermodynamic costs, we identify optimal
initial states that maximize the efficiency. These results establish
initial-state design as a practical and scalable approach to coherence control,
offering guidance for the development of efficient quantum thermodynamic
devices.

Conclusion: 该协议为量子公钥密码学提供了新的方向，并具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a quantum authentication and digital signature protocol whose
security is founded on the Quantum Merlin Arthur~(QMA)-completeness of the
consistency of local density matrices. The protocol functions as a true
public-key cryptography system, where the public key is a set of local density
matrices generated from the private key, a global quantum state. This
construction uniquely eliminates the need for trusted third parties, pre-shared
secrets, or authenticated classical channels for public key distribution,
making a significant departure from symmetric protocols like quantum key
distribution. We provide a rigorous security analysis, proving the scheme's
unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks by quantum adversaries.
The proof proceeds by a formal reduction, demonstrating that a successful
forgery would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the QMA-complete
Consistency of Quantum Marginal Problem~(QMP). We further analyze the
efficiency of verification using partial quantum state tomography, establishing
the protocol's theoretical robustness and outlining a path towards practical
implementation

Conclusion: 环形结构为高效纳米光纤光-物质接口和量子电动力学应用提供了潜力。

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collective emission of one and two circular
arrays of two-level atoms surrounding an optical nanofiber. We show that the
radiation eigenmodes of a single ring selectively couple to specific guided
modes of the fiber, according to their symmetry, and study how the physical
parameters of the system control their nature. In particular, we identify
situations in which the emission toward radiation modes is highly suppressed
with respect to fiber-guided modes while the lifetime of the atomic excitation
is enhanced. We further address the case of two identical nanorings positioned
at a distance from each other along the nanofiber. By contrast to free-space
configurations, the rings can exchange excitations even at large separation
through nanofiber guided modes resulting in enhanced sub- and super-radiance
with respect to the single-ring case. Our findings suggest that the ring
configuration is promising for the implementation of efficient and versatile
light-matter nanofiber-based interfaces and the achievement of waveguide
quantum electrodynamics.

Abstract: We construct a family of quantum low-density parity-check codes locally
equivalent to higher-dimensional quantum hypergraph-product (QHP) codes.
Similarly to QHP codes, the proposed codes have highly redundant sets of
low-weight stabilizer generators, which improves decoding accuracy in a
fault-tolerant regime and gives them single-shot properties. The advantage of
the new construction is that it gives shorter codes. We derive simple
expressions for the dimension of the proposed codes in two important special
cases, give bounds on the distances, and explicitly construct some relatively
short codes. Circuit simulations for codes locally equivalent to 4-dimensional
toric codes show a (pseudo)threshold close to 1.1%, better than for toric or

Conclusion: concurrence fill为多体纠缠的量化提供了更可靠和操作性强的方法。

Abstract: Despite the successful experimental generation and verification of genuine
multipartite entanglement, several existing entanglement measures remain
insufficient to reliably capture its presence. In this study, we overcome this
challenge by utilizing a geometric measure known as concurrence fill, which
quantifies genuine multipartite entanglement using the area associated with the
underlying concurrence triangle. Firstly, the concurrence fill for three-qubit
pure states is reformulated using three tangle and partial tangles. This yields
a representation that is more tractable and operational. Using this
formulation, we derive a criterion to classify GHZ and W class of states. Next,
we analyse the rank-2 mixture of generalized GHZ and W class of states.
Furthermore, we derive the concurrence fill for the eigenstates of the
corresponding mixture and obtain an upper bound for mixed states with zero
tangle.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits represent promising architectures for machine
learning applications, yet many lack clear connections to classical models,
potentially limiting their ability to translate the wide success of classical
neural networks to the quantum realm. We examine a specific type of quantum
neural network (QNN) built exclusively from SWAP test circuits, and discuss its
mathematical equivalence to a classical two-layer feedforward network with
quadratic activation functions under amplitude encoding. Our analysis across
classical real-world and synthetic datasets reveals that while this
architecture can successfully learn many practical tasks, it exhibits
fundamental expressivity limitations due to violating the universal
approximation theorem, particularly failing on harder problems like the parity
check function. To address this limitation, we introduce a circuit modification
using generalized SWAP test circuits that effectively implements classical
neural networks with product layers. This enhancement enables successful
learning of parity check functions in arbitrary dimensions which we
analytically argue to be impossible for the original architecture beyond two
dimensions regardless of network size. Our results establish a framework for
enhancing QNN expressivity through classical task analysis and demonstrate that
our SWAP test-based architecture offers broad representational capacity,
suggesting potential promise also for quantum learning tasks.

Conclusion: 这是设备无关验证量子因果顺序不确定性的重要一步，并为识别相关实验漏洞提供了背景。

Abstract: In classical physics, events follow a definite causal order: the past
influences the future, but not the reverse. Quantum theory, however, permits
superpositions of causal orders -- so-called indefinite causal orders -- which
can provide operational advantages over classical scenarios. Verifying such
phenomena has sparked significant interest, much like earlier efforts devoted
to refuting local realism and confirming the quantum entanglement. To date,
demonstrations of indefinite causal order have all been based a process called
the quantum switch and have relied on device-dependent or
semi-device-independent protocols. A recent theoretical development introduced
a Bell-like inequality that allows for fully device-independent verification of
indefinite causal order in a quantum switch. Here we implement this
verification by experimentally violating this inequality. In particular, we
measure a value of $1.8427 \pm 0.0038$, which is 24 standard deviations above
the classical bound of $1.75$. Our work presents the first implementation of a
device-independent protocol to verify indefinite causal order, albeit in the
presence of experimental loopholes. This represents an important step towards
the device-independent verification of an indefinite causal order, and provides
a context in which to identify loopholes specifically related to the
verification of indefinite causal order.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the trade-off between the circuit depth and the
number of ancillary qubits for preparing sparse quantum states. We prove that
any $n$-qubit $d$-spare quantum state (i.e., it has only $d$ non-zero
amplitudes) can be prepared by a quantum circuit with depth $O\left(\frac{nd
\log m}{m \log m/n} + \log nd\right)$ using $m\geq 6n$ ancillary qubits, which
achieves the current best trade-off between depth and ancilla number. In
particular, when $m = \Theta({\frac{nd}{\log d}})$, our result recovers the
optimal circuit depth $\Theta(\log nd)$ given in
\hyperlink{cite.zhang2022quantum}{[Phys. Rev. Lett., 129, 230504(2022)]}, but
using significantly fewer gates and ancillary qubits.

Abstract: Noise is a hindering factor for current-era quantum computers. In this study,
we experimentally validate the theoretical relationships between control noise
and qubit state fidelity. The experiment comprises a 10$\times$10 site optical
tweezer array stochastically loaded with single rubidium-85 atoms. A global
microwave field is used to manipulate the state of the hyperfine qubits. With
precise control of the time-dependent amplitude of the microwave drive, we
apply control signals featuring artificial noise. We systematically analyze the
impact of various noise profiles on the fidelity distribution of the quantum
states. The measured fidelities are compared against theoretical predictions
made using the stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Our results show a good
agreement between the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted
results. This validation is consequential, as the model provides critical
information on noise identification and optimal control protocols in NISQ-era
quantum systems.

Result: 检测概率约18%，在噪声环境下表现稳健，但准粒子污染会降低检测率。

Conclusion: 该协议为区分MZMs与ABSs提供了实验可行的解决方案，适用于噪声环境。

Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are non-Abelian quasiparticles with the potential
to serve as topological qubits for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to
their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In multi-Majorana
systems configured into two separated subsystems, nontrivial quantum
correlations persist, but the presence of trivial Andreev bound states (ABSs)
can obscure this nonlocality if MZM preparation fails. To address this, we
propose a protocol using an entanglement witness based solely on parity
measurements to distinguish the nonlocal characteristics of MZM systems. Our
framework, which is experimentally implementable, achieves a detection
probability of approximately 18% in a 6-site system and demonstrates robustness
under environmental noise, albeit with a reduced detection rate in the resence
of quasiparticle contamination.

Conclusion: 四阶TCL生成器在适用范围内提供了计算优势，并纠正了二阶TCL主方程的非马尔可夫性高估问题。

Abstract: The spin-boson model is a widely used model for understanding the properties
of a two-level open quantum system. Accurately describing its dynamics often
requires going beyond the weak system-environment coupling approximation.
However, calculating the higher-order generators of such a dynamics, with a
system-environment coupling that is not too weak, has been known to be
challenging, both numerically and analytically. This work presents the
analytical derivation of the complete fourth-order time-convolutionless (TCL)
generator for a generic spin-boson model, accurate up to 4th order in the
system-environment coupling parameter, under the assumption that the
environmental spectral density is an odd function of frequency. In the case of
a semiconductor double-quantum-dot system, our results reveal corrections to
the dynamics that may become physically significant in some parameter regimes.
Furthermore, we report that the widely used second-order TCL master equation
tends to overestimate the non-Markovianity of a dynamics over a large parameter
regime. Within the regime of its applicability, our results provide a
computational advantage over numerically exact techniques. The accuracy of the
fourth-order TCL generator is rigorously benchmarked against specialized
analytical calculations done for the Ohmic spectral density with Drude cutoff
and against the numerically exact Hierarchical Equations of Motion technique.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了熵积累的线性特性，并展示了非信号对手的攻击潜力。

Abstract: The question of security of practical device-independent protocols against
no-signalling adversaries, the ultimate form of cryptographic security, has
remained open. A key ingredient is to identify how the entropy in the raw
outputs of a Bell test accumulates over $n$ sequential runs (termed
time-ordered no-signalling) against a no-signalling adversary. Previous
numerical and analytical investigations for small $n$ ($\leq 5$) had suggested
that the min-entropy might not accumulate linearly in contrast to the case of
quantum adversaries. Here we point out that despite the findings for small $n$,
the min-entropy does in fact accumulate linearly for large $n$. We illustrate
the difference in randomness accumulation against quantum and no-signalling
adversaries with the paradigmatic example of the Chained Bell test for which we
analytically derive the min-entropy. Finally, we illustrate the power of the
no-signalling adversary by providing a class of attacks that allow an
eavesdropper to perfectly guess the outputs of one player in general bipartite
Pseudotelepathy games.

Conclusion: 研究对理解半经典行为的本质及评估量子控制修正具有潜在价值。

Abstract: Semiclassical descriptions of the dynamics of a few-level system coupled to a
mode of the electromagnetic field which effectively reduce the contribution of
the field to a time-dependent term in the Hamiltonian of the few-level system
are widely used. For example, such an approach is typically taken in quantum
control applications. However, the underlying quantum character of the field
will lead to corrections to the semiclassical dynamics which, given sufficient
time, can lead to significant changes. Here we develop an approach for
calculating these quantum corrections systematically, building on the
time-dependent Floquet dynamics that emerges in the semiclassical limit. Using
the Rabi model of a spin--field system as an illustrative example, we obtain
approximate analytic expressions for the first-order quantum corrections to the
semiclassical dynamics of the spin for a range of initial field states. These
expressions describe the initial stages of the full quantum dynamics
accurately, though they eventually fail for sufficiently long times. Our work
has relevance both for understanding the fundamental properties of emergent
semiclassical behavior and as a potential tool for assessing corrections to
semiclassical control techniques.

Conclusion: 旋转编码通过扩展逻辑基态，显著提升了噪声抑制能力，为量子纠错提供了新思路。

Abstract: We construct rotated logical states by applying rotation operators to
stabilizer states, extending the logical basis and modifying stabilizer
generators. Rotation operators affect the effective code distance $d_R$, which
decays exponentially with rotation angles $(\theta, \phi)$, influencing error
correction performance. We quantify the scaling behavior of logical error rates
under circuit-level noise, comparing standard depolarizing (SD) and
superconducting-inspired (SI) noise models with small and large rotations. Our
findings show that the rotated code scales as $0.68d_R (0.65d_R)$ for SD and
$0.81d_R (0.77d_R)$ for SI, with small rotation angles leading to a steeper
decay of logical error rates. At a physical error rate $p_{phy}$ of $10^{-4}$,
logical errors decrease exponentially with $d_R$, particularly under SI noise,
which exhibits stronger suppression. The threshold error rates for rotated
logical states are compared with previous results, demonstrating improved
resilience against noise. By extending the logical state basis, rotation-based
encoding increases error suppression beyond traditional stabilizer codes,
offering a promising approach to advancing quantum error correction.

Abstract: One of the key challenges in quantum machine learning is finding relevant
machine learning tasks with a provable quantum advantage. A natural candidate
for this is learning unknown Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we tackle the
supervised learning version of this problem, where we are given random examples
of the inputs to the dynamics as classical data, paired with the expectation
values of some observable after the time evolution, as corresponding output
labels. The task is to replicate the corresponding input-output function. We
prove that this task can yield provable exponential classical-quantum learning
advantages under common complexity assumptions in natural settings. To design
our quantum learning algorithms, we introduce a new method, which we term
\textit{\subroutine}~algorithm for parametrized circuit functions, and which
may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of
generalizing our method to arbitrary quantum dynamics while maintaining
provable guarantees. We explain that significant generalizations are impossible
under certain complexity-theoretic assumptions, but nonetheless, we provide a
heuristic kernel method, where we trade-off provable correctness for broader
applicability.

Result: Bargmann不变量的取值范围是凸的，且可通过量子比特态或循环三能级态实现。

Conclusion: 本文为Bargmann不变量提供了完整的几何描述和实现方法，解决了相关猜想。

Abstract: Bargmann invariants, also known as multivariate traces of quantum states
$\operatorname{Tr}(\rho_1 \rho_2 \cdots \rho_n)$, are unitary invariant
quantities used to characterize weak values, Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities,
out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), and geometric phases. Here we give a
complete characterization of the set $B_n$ of complex values that $n$-th order
invariants can take, resolving some recently proposed conjectures. We show that
$B_n$ is equal to the range of invariants arising from pure states described by
Gram matrices of circulant form. We show that both ranges are equal to the
$n$-th power of the complex unit $n$-gon, and are therefore convex, which
provides a simple geometric intuition. Finally, we show that any Bargmann
invariant of order $n$ is realizable using either qubit states, or circulant
qutrit states.

Conclusion: QHC在寻找评估任何真值表所需的最小量子比特和门资源方面具有潜力，可推动FPGA与量子电路的集成。

Abstract: Quantum arithmetic computation requires a substantial number of scratch
qubits to stay reversible. These operations necessitate qubit and gate
resources equivalent to those needed for the larger of the input or output
registers due to state encoding. Quantum Hamiltonian Computing (QHC) introduces
a novel approach by encoding input for logic operations within a single
rotating quantum gate. This innovation reduces the required qubit register $ N
$ to the size of the output states $ O $, where $ N = \log_2 O $. Leveraging
QHC principles, we present reversible half-adder and full-adder circuits that
compress the standard Toffoli + CNOT layout [Vedral et al., PRA, 54, 11,
(1996)] from three-qubit and four-qubit formats for the Quantum half-adder
circuit and five sequential Fredkin gates using five qubits [Moutinho et al.,
PRX Energy 2, 033002 (2023)] for full-adder circuit; into a two-qubit, 4$\times
$4 Hilbert space. This scheme, presented here, is optimized for classical logic
evaluated on quantum hardware, which due to unitary evolution can bypass
classical CMOS energy limitations to certain degree. Although we avoid
superposition of input and output states in this manuscript, this remains
feasible in principle. We see the best application for QHC in finding the
minimal qubit and gate resources needed to evaluate any truth table, advancing
FPGA capabilities using integrated quantum circuits or photonics.

Abstract: A key challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing is synthesising and
optimising circuits in a noisy environment, as traditional techniques often
fail to account for the effect of noise on circuits. In this work, we propose a
framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum circuits that are correct by
construction. The framework starts with idealised specifications of
fault-tolerant gadgets and refines them using provably sound basic
transformations.
  To reason about manipulating circuits while preserving their error correction
properties, we define fault equivalence; two circuits are considered
fault-equivalent if all undetectable faults on one circuit have a corresponding
fault on the other. This guarantees that the effect of undetectable faults on
both circuits is the same. We argue that fault equivalence is a concept that is
already implicitly present in the literature. Many problems, such as state
preparation and syndrome extraction, can be naturally expressed as finding an
implementable circuit that is fault-equivalent to an idealised specification.
  To utilize fault equivalence in a computationally tractable manner, we adapt
the ZX calculus, a diagrammatic language for quantum computing. We restrict its
rewrite system to not only preserve the underlying linear map but also fault
equivalence, i.e. the circuit's behaviour under noise. Enabled by our
framework, we verify, optimise and synthesise new and efficient circuits for
syndrome extraction and cat state preparation. We anticipate that fault
equivalence can capture and unify different approaches in fault-tolerant
quantum computing, paving the way for an end-to-end circuit compilation
framework.

Abstract: We investigate the performance of two quantum error-correcting codes, the
surface code and the Bacon-Shor code, for implementation with spin qubits in
silicon. In each case, we construct a logical qubit using a planar array of
quantum dots, exploring two encoding schemes: one based solely on
single-electron Zeeman qubits (Loss-DiVincenzo qubits), and a hybrid approach
combining Zeeman and singlet-triplet qubits. For both codes, we evaluate key
performance metrics, including logical state preparation fidelity and
cycle-level error correction performance, using state-of-the-art experimental
parameters. Our results show that the hybrid encoding consistently outperforms
the pure Zeeman-qubit implementation. By identifying the dominant error
mechanisms that limit quantum error correction performance, our study
highlights concrete targets for improving spin qubit hardware and provides a
path toward scalable fault-tolerant architectures. In particular, we find that
the logical error rate is not limited by memory errors, but rather by gate
errors, especially 1- and 2-qubit gate errors.

Abstract: Randomized algorithms such as qDRIFT provide an efficient framework for
quantum simulation by sampling terms from a decomposition of the system's
generator. However, existing error bounds for qDRIFT scale quadratically with
the norm of the generator, limiting their efficiency for large-scale closed or
open quantum system simulation. In this work, we refine the qDRIFT error bound
by incorporating Jensen's inequality and a careful treatment of the integral
form of the error. This yields an improved scaling that significantly reduces
the number of steps required to reach a fixed simulation accuracy. Our result
applies to both closed and open quantum systems, and we explicitly recover the
improved bound in the Hamiltonian case. To demonstrate the practical impact of
this refinement, we apply it to three settings: quantum chemistry simulations,
dissipative transverse field Ising models, and Hamiltonian encoding of
classical data for quantum machine learning. In each case, our bound leads to a
substantial reduction in gate counts, highlighting its broad utility in
enhancing randomized simulation techniques.

Abstract: Emergent quantum computing technologies are widely expected to provide novel
approaches in the simulation of quantum chemistry. Despite rapid improvements
in the scale and fidelity of quantum computers, high resource requirements make
the execution of quantum chemistry experiments challenging. Typical experiments
are limited in the number of qubits used, incur a substantial shot cost, or
require complex architecture-specific optimization and error mitigation
techniques. In this paper, we propose a conceptually simple benchmarking
approach involving the use of multi-ancilla quantum phase estimation. Our
approach is restricted to very small chemical systems, and does not scale
favorably beyond molecular systems that can be described with $2$ qubits;
however, this restriction allows us to generate circuits that scale
quadratically in gate count with the number of qubits in the readout register.
This enables the execution of quantum chemistry circuits that act on many
qubits, while producing meaningful results with limited shot counts. We use
this technique (with $200$ shots per experiment) to calculate the ground state
energy of molecular hydrogen to $50$ bits of precision ($8.9 \times 10^{-16}$
hartree) on a $56$-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer, negating Trotter error.
Including Trotter error, we obtain between $32$ and $36$ bits of precision
($1.5 * 10^{-10}$ and $6.0 * 10^{-11}$ hartree respectively), vastly exceeding
chemical accuracy ($1.6 * 10^{-3}$ hartree) against Full Configuration
Interaction. We consider application of the approach to deeper circuits, and
discuss potential as a benchmark task for near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: Clustering and degree correlations are ubiquitous in real-world complex
networks. Yet, understanding their role in critical phenomena remains a
challenge for theoretical studies. Here, we provide the exact solution of site
percolation in a model for strongly clustered random graphs, with many
overlapping loops and heterogeneous degree distribution. We systematically
compare the exact solution with mean-field predictions obtained from a treelike
random rewiring of the network, which preserves only the degree sequence. Our
results demonstrate a nontrivial interplay between degree heterogeneity,
correlations and network topology, which can significantly alter both the
percolation threshold and the critical exponents predicted by the mean-field.
These findings highlight the need for new approaches, beyond the heterogeneous
mean-field theory, to accurately describe phase transitions in complex networks
with realistic topological features.

Abstract: Quantum turbulence shares many similarities with classical turbulence in the
isotropic and homogeneous case, despite the inviscid and quantized nature of
its vortices. However, when quantum fluids are subjected to rotation, their
turbulent dynamics depart significantly from the classical expectations. We
explore the phenomenology of rotating quantum turbulence, emphasizing how
rotation introduces new regimes with no classical analogs. We review recent
theoretical, experimental, and numerical developments, and present new
numerical results that map out distinct dynamical regimes arising from the
interplay of rotation, quantization, non-linearities, and condensed matter
regimes. In particular, we show the importance of distinguishing the dynamics
of rotating quantum fluids in the slowly rotating, rapidly rotating, and low
Landau level regimes. The findings have implications for the dynamics of liquid
helium, atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and neutron stars, and show how
rotating quantum fluids can serve as a unique platform bridging turbulence
theory and condensed matter physics revealing novel states of
out-of-equilibrium quantum matter.

Abstract: Disorder can be applied to transform conducting to insulating states by
localizing individual quantum particles. The interplay between disorder and
interactions in many-particle systems leads to a richer tapestry of quantum
phase transitions. Here, we report the measurement in an ultracold lattice gas
of a disorder-induced transition from a state with small disorder-independent
compressibility to a state for which compressibility increases with disorder.
At zero temperature this is the transition from a Mott insulator (MI) to a Bose
glass (BG), both of which are insulating states. This transformation is
observed using measurements of core compressibility. By determining how double
occupancy changes with atom number, we identify the threshold disorder strength
required to switch from disorder-independent MI-like to disorder-dependent
BG-like compressible behavior.

Abstract: We study an extension of the 2D Fermi--Hubbard model, which was recently
introduced in [Das et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 263402 (2024)] and shown to
describe altermagnetism that can be studied in cold atom systems. Using an
updated Hartree--Fock method that can detect instabilities towards phase
separation, we show that the model is in a mixed phase in large parts of the
parameter regime at half-filling. We argue that the occurrence of a mixed phase
is an indication of exotic physics which, in this model, occurs in parameter
regimes accessible in cold atom experiments.

weakly bound molecules are formed using a Feshbach resonance at 361.7 G. The
molecular gas contains $7.6(10)\times 10^3$ molecules with a lifetime of about
130 ms, limited by two-body decay. We perform Feshbach spectroscopy to observe
several new interspecies resonances and characterize the bound state used for
magnetoassociation. Finally, we fit the combined results to obtain improved
K-Cs interaction potentials. This provides a good starting point for the
creation of ultracold samples of ground-state $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules.

Abstract: Dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) possesses characteristics different from the
conventional isotropic s-wave interaction in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs),
the interplay of DDI with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rotation may induce
novel quantum properties. We systematically analyze the effects of the DDI,
Weyl-like SOC, rotation and trap anharmonicity in the ground state of
two-componen BECs. The interplay of these factors leads to a kaleidoscope of
quantum states of quantum defects and quantum droplets in lattice, wheel and
ring forms of distributions, with transitions of topology of density and a
critical behavior in varying the parameters. We also show a bunch of exotic
spin topological structures, including centric vortex surrounded by layers of
spin flows, compound topological structure of edge defect, and various
coexistence states of skyrmions with different topological charge. In
particular, we find quarter skyrmions and other possible fractional skyrmions.
Rashba-type SOC and Weyl-like SOC are compared as well. Our study implies that
one can manipulate both the density topology and the spin topological structure
via these tunable parameters in BECs. The abundant variations of the
topological structures and particularly the revealed critical behavior may
provide various quantum resources for potential applications in quantum
metrology.

Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for

investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms.
Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent
double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and
crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole
interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a
DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS
regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order.
Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally
accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.

Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases
remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement
techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate an
artificial intelligence approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the
chemical potential and temperature from single-shot, in situ imaged density
profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is
trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap
configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second.
The model also demonstrates zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry
and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating thermodynamic parameters
for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite
no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining
predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively
brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These
results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations
in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric
configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially
enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such
capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst
improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.

Abstract: Recent experiments demonstrate that rapidly rotating Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs) near the lowest Landau level can self-organize into
interaction-driven persistent droplet arrays. Inspired by this discovery, we
investigate the formation and dynamics of single droplet and droplet arrays in
rapidly rotating BECs. Guided by a rigorous theorem on localized many-body
states for 2D interacting systems in a magnetic field, we construct single
droplet and droplet arrays states which are shown to be stationary solutions to
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the rotating frame. The single droplet is
shown to be dynamically stable, which underpins its role as the basic unit in a
droplet array. The stability of the droplet arrays is demonstrated by their
dynamic formation from a phase engineered initial condensate. Our study sheds
light onto the nature of the droplet state in a rapidly rotating BEC and offers
a new approach for generating and manipulating quantum droplet arrays through
designing the initial condensate phase.

Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D)
sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic
dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By
properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling
between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength
Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong
patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the
scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a
smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux
per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures.
Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and
the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field
resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy
bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of
ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against
non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for
simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold
atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated
topological phases with high tunability.

Conclusion: 非平衡输运网络的最优性原则与热力学形式主义密切相关，广义耗散和熵产生的极值化揭示了特定条件下的行为，而成本优化则可能导致不稳定操作点。

Abstract: Optimality principles in nonequilibrium transport networks are linked to a
thermodynamic formalism based on generalized transport potentials endowed with
Legendre duality and related contact structure. This allows quantifying the
distance from non-equilibrium operating points, analogously to thermodynamic
availability as well as to shed light on optimality principles in relation to
different imposed constraints. Extremizations of generalized dissipation and
entropy production appear as special cases that require power-law resistances
and -- for entropy production -- also isothermal conditions. Changes in
stability of multiple operating points are interpreted as phase transitions
based on non-equilibrium equations of state, while cost-based optimization of
transport properties reveals connections to the generalized dissipation in the
case of power law costs and linear resistance law, but now with typically
unstable operating points which give rise to branched optimal transport.

Abstract: This work explores the implications of assuming time symmetry and applying
bridge-type, time-symmetric temporal boundary conditions to deterministic laws
of nature with random components. The analysis, drawing on the works of
Kolmogorov and Anderson, leads to two forms of governing equations, referred to
here as symmetric and antisymmetric. These equations account for the emergence
of characteristics associated with conventional thermodynamics, the arrow of
time, and a form of antecedent causality. The directional properties of time
arise from the mathematical structure of Markov bridges, without requiring any
postulates that impose a preferred direction of time.

Abstract: The thermodynamic limit is foundational to statistical mechanics, underlying
our understanding of many-body phases. It assumes that, as the system size
grows infinitely at fixed density of particles, unambiguous macroscopic phases
emerge that are independent of the system's boundary shape. We present explicit
quantum spin and dimer Hamiltonians whose ground states violate this principle.
Our construction relies on the previous mathematical work on classical dimers
on the Aztec diamond and the square-octagon fortress, where geometry-dependent
phase behaviors are observed in the infinite-size limit. We reverse engineer
quantum spin Hamiltonians on the square and the square-octagon lattices whose
ground states at the Rokhsar-Kivelson points are described by classical dimer
coverings. On diamond-shaped domains, we find macroscopic boundary regions
exhibiting distinct quantum phases from those on square-shaped domains. We
study the nature of these phases by calculating the dimer-dimer and vison
correlators and adapt Kasteleyn matrix based analytical and numerical methods
for computing the vison correlator, which are significantly more efficient than
standard Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that the square-octagon
lattice supports a single gapped short-range entangled phase, with
exponentially decaying dimer correlators and a constant vison correlator. When
the same model is considered on a diamond-shaped domain, an additional ordered
phase emerges near the corners, where the dimers are in a staggered pattern.

Conclusion: 边界条件对踢伊辛模型中时间演化算符迹的统计特性具有出乎意料的强烈影响，开放边界条件下的结果符合随机矩阵理论的预期。

Abstract: The kicked Ising model has been studied extensively as a model of quantum
chaos. Bertini, Kos, and Prosen studied the system in the thermodynamic limit,
finding an analytic expression for the spectral form factor, $K(t)$, at the
self-dual point with periodic boundary conditions. The spectral form factor is
the 2nd moment of the trace of the time evolution operator, and we study the
higher moments of this random variable in the kicked Ising model. A previous
study of these higher moments by Flack, Bertini, and Prosen showed that,
surprisingly, the trace behaves like a real Gaussian random variable when the
system has periodic boundary conditions at the self dual point. By contrast, we
investigate the model with open boundary conditions at the self dual point and
find that the trace of the time evolution operator behaves as a complex
Gaussian random variable as expected from random matrix universality based on
the circular orthogonal ensemble. This result highlights a surprisingly strong
effect of boundary conditions on the statistics of the trace. We also study a
generalization of the spectral form factor known as the Loschmidt spectral form
factor and present results for different boundary conditions.

Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic
fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and
macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a
wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of
time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field, as a
finite-wavevector extension of the Green--Kubo formula. Two-dimensional
molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence
characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber
behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between
mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.

Abstract: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is ubiquitous in quantum mechanical systems where it
drives various phase transitions and emergent physics. To understand the role
of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in the thermalization of a local observable in a
disordered system, we consider random symmetric centrosymmetric (SC) matrices
where the exchange symmetry is conserved. Such a conservation law splits the
Hilbert space into decoupled subspaces such that the energy spectrum of a SC
matrix is a superposition of two pure spectra. After discussing the known
results on the correlations of such mixed spectrum, we consider different
initial states and analytically compute the entire time evolution of their
survival probability and associated timescales. We show that there exist
certain initial states which do not decay over a very long timescales such that
a measure zero fraction of random SC matrices exhibit spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Later, we show that thermalization is violated for a generic local
observable in case of the SC matrices, where the generalized Gibbs ensemble
accurately captures the equilibrium expectation values.

Abstract: This note addresses the relevance of rare events in system dynamics, inspired
by Jill North reflections on the origin of the arrow of time in thermodynamics.
After identifying the existence of rare events, characterized by a Pareto
distribution, within a simple gas particle simulation, we investigate their
impact on entropy evolution. These rare events are associated with microstates
that locally decrease entropy, in contrast to the overall entropy increase
observed in the bulk of the system. We present numerical simulations of gas
particles, both without and with a gravity-like attractive force, to explore
the fate of these rare events. Our results show that, while rare events can
transiently generate local decreases in entropy, global entropy may continue to
increase in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. The introduction
of gravity-like attraction stabilizes these low-entropy configurations,
allowing them to persist longer. This study highlights the interplay between
rare statistical fluctuations and macroscopic thermodynamic behavior, providing
new insights into the emergence and stability of order in complex systems.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of models and theories that describe complex
experimental systems $\unicode{x2014}$in fields like high-energy and
condensed-matter physics$\unicode{x2014}$ are becoming increasingly important.
Examples include lattice gauge theories, which can describe, among others,
quantum chromodynamics (the Standard Model description of strong interactions
between elementary particles), and spin-glass systems. Beyond fundamental
research, these computational methods also find practical applications, among
many others, in optimization, finance, and complex biological problems.
However, Monte Carlo simulations, an important subcategory of these methods,
are plagued by a major drawback: they are extremely greedy for (pseudo) random
numbers. The total fraction of computer time dedicated to random-number
generation increases as the hardware grows more sophisticated, and can get
prohibitive for special-purpose computing platforms. We propose here a
general-purpose microcanonical simulated annealing (mic.SA) formalism that
dramatically reduces such a burden. The algorithm is fully adapted to a
massively parallel computation, as we show in the particularly demanding
benchmark of the three-dimensional Ising spin glass. We carry out very
stringent numerical tests of the new algorithm by comparing our results,
obtained on GPUs, with high-precision standard (i.e., random-number-greedy)
simulations performed on the Janus II custom-built supercomputer. In those
cases where thermal equilibrium is reachable (i.e., in the paramagnetic phase),
both simulations reach compatible values. More significantly, barring
short-time corrections, a simple time rescaling suffices to map the mic.SA
off-equilibrium dynamics onto the results obtained with standard simulations.

Result: 方法在基准案例和实际系统中验证了准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为化学反应的广义朗之万方程推断提供了新途径。

Abstract: Since Kramers' pioneering work in 1940, significant efforts have been devoted
to studying Langevin equations applied to physical and chemical reactions
projected onto few collective variables, with particular focus on the inference
of their parameters. While the inference for overdamped Langevin equations is
well-established and widely applied, a notable gap remains in the literature
for underdamped Langevin equations, which incorporate inertial effects and
velocities. This gap arises from the challenge of accessing velocities solely
through finite differences of positions, resulting in spurious correlations. In
this letter, we propose an analytical correction for these correlations,
specifically designed for a likelihood-maximization algorithm that exploits
short, non-ergodic trajectories that can be obtained at reasonable numerical
cost. The accuracy and robustness of our approach are tested across a benchmark
case and a realistic system. This work paves the way for applying generalized
Langevin equation inference to chemical reactions.

Result: 发现一组分等离子体工质下，发动机以Curzon-Ahlborn效率运行；而光子工质效率显著较低，与Otto循环相反。

Conclusion: 研究结果扩展了内可逆发动机工质的适用范围，并揭示了效率与状态方程的依赖关系。

Abstract: Endoreversible engine cycles are a cornerstone of finite-time thermodynamics.
We show that endoreversible Stirling engines operating with a one-component
plasma as working medium run at maximal power output with the Curzon-Ahlborn
efficiency. As a main result, we elucidate that this is actually a consequence
of the fact that the caloric equation of state depends only linearly on
temperature and only additively on volume. In particular, neither the exact
form of the mechanical equation of state, nor the full fundamental relation are
required. Thus, our findings immediately generalize to a larger class of
working plasmas, far beyond simple ideal gases. In addition, we show that for
plasmas described by the photonic equation of state the efficiency is
significantly lower. This is in stark contrast to endoreversible Otto cycles,
for which photonic engines have an efficiency larger than the Curzon-Ahlborn
efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子气体与辐射相互作用的研究提供了新工具，并讨论了准粒子有效质量的定义问题。

Abstract: An approach to the theoretical study of effects and phenomena in quantum
gases interacting with radiation is proposed. The approach is based on a
modification of the canonical transformation method, which was once used to
diagonalize Hamiltonians describing the interaction of electrons with phonons
in a solid. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated by studying the
influence of photons on the spectral characteristics of atoms of quantum gases
interacting with radiation. Within the framework of the developed approach, the
effect of "dressing" atoms of quantum gases by a cloud of virtual photons is
investigated and expressions for the energy characteristics of such dressed
atoms - quasiparticles are obtained. The problem of defining the concept of the
effective mass of such quasiparticles is discussed.

Conclusion: 该研究为非平衡系统的数据驱动分析提供了新工具，扩展了响应理论的应用范围。

Abstract: The link between forced and free fluctuations for nonequilibrium systems can
be described via a generalized version of the celebrated
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The use of the formalism of the Koopman
operator makes it possible to deliver an intepretable form of the response
operators written as a sum of exponentially decaying terms, each associated
one-to-one with a mode of natural variability of the system. Here we showcase
on a stochastically forced version of the celebrated Lorenz '63 model the
feasibility and skill of such an approach by considering different Koopman
dictionaries, which allows us to treat also seamlessly coarse-graining
approaches like the Ulam method. Our findings provide support for the
development of response theory-based investigation methods also in an
equation-agnostic, data-driven environment.

Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model on an infinite strip of the
triangular lattice using the transfer-matrix method combined with a
sparse-matrix factorization technique. Through finite-size scaling analysis of
numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate
the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the
first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap,
reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature
decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical
point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory
predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results
underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying
phase transitions in complex lattice models.

Abstract: Modulating liquid-to-solid transitions and the resulting crystalline
structure for tailored properties is much desired. Colloidal systems are
exemplary to this end, but the fundamental knowledge gaps in relating the
influence of intermolecular interactions to crystallization behavior continue
to hinder progress. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by studying
nucleation and growth in systems with modified Lennard-Jones potential.
Specifically, we study the commonly used 12-6 potential and a softer 7-6
potential. The thermodynamic state point for the study is chosen such that both
systems are investigated at the same level of supercooling and pressure. Under
these conditions, we find that the nucleation rate for both systems is
comparable. Interestingly, the nucleation pathways and resulting crystal
structures are different. In the 12-6 system, nucleation and growth occur
predominantly through the FCC structure. Softening the potential alters the
critical nucleus composition and introduces two distinct nucleation pathways.
One pathway predominantly leads to the nucleus with a body-centered cubic (BCC)
structure, while the other favors the face-centered cubic (FCC) arrangement.
Our study illustrates that polymorph selection can be achieved through
modifications to intermolecular interactions without impacting nucleation
kinetics. The results have significant implications in designing approaches for
polymorph selection and modulating self-assembly mechanisms.

Abstract: We propose a mean-field (MF) approximation for the recurrence relation
governing the dynamics of $m$ species of particles on a square lattice, and we
simultaneously perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations under identical initial
conditions to emulate the intricate motion observed in environments such as
subway corridors and scramble crossings in large cities. Each species moves
according to transition probabilities influenced by its respective static floor
field and the state of neighboring cells. To illustrate the methodology, we
analyze statistical fluctuations in the spatial distribution for $m = 1$, $m =
2$, and $m = 4$ and for different regimes of average density and biased
movement. A numerical comparison is conducted to determine the best agreement
between the MC simulations and the MF approximation considering a
renormalization exponent $\beta$ that optimizes the fit between methods.
Finally, we report a phenomenon we term "Gaussian-to-Gaussian" behavior, in
which an initially normal distribution of particles becomes distorted due to
interactions among same and opposing species, passes through a transient
regime, and eventually returns to a Gaussian-like profile in the steady state,
after multiple rounds of motion under periodic boundary conditions.

Abstract: The critical behavior of the classical Ising model on a three-dimensional
fractal lattice with Hausdorff dimension $d_H = \ln32 / \ln4 = 2.5$ is
investigated using the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG)
method. We determine the critical temperature $T_c \approx 2.65231$ and the
critical exponents for magnetization $\beta \approx 0.059$ and field response
$\delta \approx 35$. Unlike a previously studied 2D fractal with $d_H \approx

at $T_c$. The results are compared with those for regular lattices and other
fractal structures to elucidate the role of dimensionality in critical
phenomena.

Abstract: We employ a procedure that enables us to calculate the excess free energies
for a finite Ising cylinder with domain walls analytically. This procedure
transparently covers all possible configurations of the domain walls under
given boundary conditions and allows for a physical interpretation in terms of
coarse-grained quantities such as surface and point tensions. The resulting
integrals contain all the information about finite-size effects; we extract
them by careful asymptotic analysis using the steepest descent method. To this
end, we exactly determine the steepest descent path and analyse its features.
For the general class of integrals, which are usually found in the study of
systems with inclined domain walls, knowledge of the steepest descent path is
necessary to detect possible intersections with poles of the integrand in the
complex plane.

Abstract: We compute high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the
Hubbard model using the unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm,
revealing an asymmetry between electron and hole doping. Electron doping
exhibits more coherent quasiparticles and stronger antiferromagnetic
correlations compared to hole doping. At low doping, a nodal-antinodal
dichotomy on the Fermi surface is observed, similar to cuprate experiments. The
dichotomy reflects the momentum dependence of the Mott gap, as manifested in
both the spectral function and the self-energy. For hole doping, we observe a
transition towards the pseudogap, without signature of pocket formation. The
simulated nuclear magnetic resonance pseudogap temperatures do not necessarily
agree with the temperature determined by spectroscopy. These findings
collectively suggest the pseudogap is a smooth crossover driven by strong
correlations.

Abstract: A high-valent palladate, $La_3Pd_2NaO_9$, has been synthesized for the first

grown using the flux method at 420 $^o$C and 70 bar oxygen pressure. Energy
dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy
(ICP) measurements show that the atomic ratio of La: (Pd+Na) is 3: 3 and Pd: Na
is 2: 1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements show that the
oxidation state of Pd is dominated by +4. Synchrotron X-ray single-crystal
diffraction measurements revealed that this material crystallizes in the
monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with charge ordering of Na and Pd. Real-space
imaging via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirmed the
crystal structure and revealed excellent sample homogeneity. Electrical
resistivity measurements show an insulating behavior. Magnetic measurements
show an unexpected paramagnetic behavior, which probably originate from a small
fraction of high-spin Pd$^{2+}$ evidenced by XPS. The successful growth of
$La_3Pd_2NaO_9$ single crystals with a high-valent oxidation state of Pd offers
an approach for exploring interesting palladates, including potential bilayer

Abstract: In principle, the logarithm of the partition function and its derivatives can
be used to rigorously determine the nature of phase transitions. However, in
practice, this approach is often ineffective in numerical calculations, since
resolving the singularities of the logarithmic partition function requires
extremely high precision data especially when distinguishing between weakly
first order phase transitions and deconfined quantum critical points. Based on
the finite size scaling hypothesis, we propose that the singular contribution
to the logarithmic partition function in quantum phase transitions can be
extracted by eliminating the leading volume-law term. This is achieved by
computing the Renyi thermal entropy (RTE) and its derivative (DRTE). We have
derived the scaling relations for RTE and DRTE, which successfully determine
the phase transition points and critical exponents through data collapse in
various quantum many body systems. Notably, beyond their utility in locating
quantum critical points, we find that DRTE is remarkably effective in detecting
weakly first order phase transitions, such as in $ JQ $ models, which were
initially thought to be continuous deconfined quantum phase transitions. The
discontinuity of these transitions is challenging to detect using traditional
local physical quantities. This work provides a new and powerful paradigm for
studying quantum many body phase transitions.

Abstract: The magnetic properties of the triangular magnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ were
investigated by magnetization and specific heat measurements down to
$T=0.03\,$K on single crystals grown by the floating zone method. The formation
of effective spins $S_\mathrm{eff}= 1/2$ below $T < 10$\,K was confirmed both
by DFT calculations and specific heat measurements. No magnetic order was found
down to $T=0.03\,$K despite the formation of magnetic correlations observed in
specific heat. The measured magnetization was compared with DMRG computation
and their agreement supports the proposal of a strongly anisotropic magnetic
interaction antiferromagnetically coupling the spin components in the $ab$
plane and ferromagnetically coupling the spin component along the $c$ axis.
However, our quantitative study of the magnetization indicates a weaker
proximity to quantum criticality between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism
than the previous inelastic neutron scattering study. Finally, we propose that
the absence of magnetic order in CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ would most probably be
related to the structural disorder revealed by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction.

pairing is mediated by the high-energy triplon excitations. As the $x^2-y^2$
band filling increases, i.e. moving further away from the Ni$^{3+}$ valence
state, the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between local
spins induce spin-density-wave order via triplon condensation. Implications of
the model for compressively strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and electron doped
oxychloride Sr$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$ are discussed.

Abstract: We theoretically study quasi-two-dimensional nickel compounds, where the
nickel ions assume Ni$^{2+}$ $d^8$ valence state and feature a low-spin $S=0$
ground state quasidegenerate with $S=1$ ionic excitations. Such a level
structure is supported by square-planar coordination of nickel ions or a
suitable substitution of apical oxygens. We construct the corresponding
singlet-triplet exchange model and explore its phase diagram and excitation
spectrum. By hole doping, we further introduce mobile Ni$^{3+}$ $d^7$ ionic
configurations with effective spins $S=1/2$, and analyze their interactions
with the $d^8$ singlet-triplet background. The interplay with the triplet
excitations in the $d^8$ sector is found to have a deep impact on the
propagation of the doped hole-like charge carriers and is identified as a
powerful source of Cooper pairing among them.

Conclusion: 模型在N=3时等价于自旋1双二次模型，揭示了自旋1链的二聚体相是伪临界且接近复CFT。

Abstract: Weak first-order pseudocriticality with approximate scale invariance has been
observed in a variety of settings, including the intriguing case of deconfined
criticality in 2+1 dimensions. Recently, this has been interpreted as extremely
slow flows ("walking behavior") for real-valued couplings in proximity to a
bona fide critical point with complex-valued couplings, described by a complex
conformal field theory (CFT). Here we study an SU($N$) generalization of the
the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, which is a familiar model for deconfined
criticality in 2+1 dimensions. We show that in 1+1 dimensions the model is
located near a complex CFT, whose proximity can be tuned as a function of $N$.
We employ state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo simulations for continuous $N$
along with an improved loop estimator for the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy
based on a nonequilibrium work protocol. These techniques allow us to track the
central charge of this model in detail as a function of $N$, where we observe
excellent agreement with CFT predictions. Notably, this includes the region
$N>2$, where the CFT moves into the complex plane and pseudocritical drifts
enable us to recover the real part of the complex central charge with
remarkable accuracy. Since the present model with $N=3$ is also equivalent to
the spin-1 biquadratic model, our work sheds new light on the dimerized phase
of the spin-1 chain, demonstrating that it is pseudocritical and proximate to a
complex CFT.

Conclusion: 为掺杂Mott绝缘体中强耦合超导性的稳定提供了一个广泛适用的理论框架。

Abstract: Antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are often viewed as competing orders
in correlated electron systems. Here, we demonstrate that kinetic frustration
in hole motion facilitates their coexistence within the square-lattice
repulsive Hubbard model. Combining exact analytical solutions on tailored
geometries with large-scale numerical simulations, we reveal a robust pairing
mechanism: holes on opposite sublattices behave as if they carry opposite
effective charges due to spin singlet formation from kinetic frustration. This
emergent property suppresses phase separation and fosters a coherent $d$-wave
superconducting channel embedded within a long-range antiferromagnetic
background. Our findings establish a minimal yet broadly applicable framework
for stabilizing strong-coupling superconductivity in doped Mott insulators.

Abstract: We show that the standard textbook description of (restricted) Hartree--Fock
theory for (Fermi) Hubbard-like models is in need of an update, and we present
such an update allowing us to correct basic and established results in the
condensed matter physics literature that are qualitatively wrong. Our update
amounts to adding a test which reliably checks the thermodynamic stability of
solutions of Hartree--Fock equations. This stability test makes it possible to
detect, by simple means and with certainty, regions in phase space where the
model exhibits mixed phases where two conventional phases coexist and
translation invariance is broken in complicated ways; in such a mixed phase,
unconventional physics is to be expected. Our results show that mixed phases
are ubiquitous in Hubbard-like models in arbitrary dimensions.

Abstract: The Mott-Hubbard metal-insulator transition is a paradigmatic phenomenon
where Coulomb interactions between electrons drive a metal-insulator phase
transition. It has been extensively studied within the Hubbard model, where a
quantum critical transition occurs at a finite temperature second-order
critical point. This work investigates the Mott metal-insulator transition in a
modified periodic Anderson model that may be viewed as a three-orbital lattice
model including an interacting, localized orbital coupled to a delocalized
conduction orbital via a second conduction orbital. This model could also be
viewed as a bilayer model involving a conventional periodic Anderson model
layer coupled to a metallic layer. Within the dynamical mean field theory, this
model possesses a strictly zero temperature quantum critical point separating a
Fermi liquid and a Mott insulating phase. By employing a simplified version of
the dynamical mean field theory, namely, the two-site or linearized dynamical
mean field theory, we provide an analytical estimate of the critical parameter
strengths at which the transition occurs at zero temperature. We also provide
an analytical estimate of the single-site von Neumann entanglement entropy.
This measure can be used as a robust identifier for the phase transition. We
extend these calculations to their cluster version to incorporate short-range,
non-local spatial correlations and discuss their effects on the transition
observed in this model.

Conclusion: 高维扩展模型为表面强关联现象提供了理论支持，并讨论了可能的实验实现途径。

Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is extended to the three and higher
dimensional systems. Nearly or absolutely flat midgap surface and hypersurface
bands are predicted based on the topological analysis, which do not require
fine tuning of parameters. By adding the on-site Coulomb interaction for the
three dimensional systems, we computationally show that the large difference in
the band widths between the surface and the bulk leads to the strongly
correlated phenomena, specifically magnetism, confined only on the surface.
Possible experimental realizations in solid state materials and metamaterials
are discussed.

Motivation: 研究CoTi2O5在低温下的磁序现象，探索其与晶体结构不兼容的原因，以及自旋Jahn-Teller效应的动力学机制。

Method: 使用中子和拉曼光谱技术，分析CoTi2O5的磁性和声学模式。

Result: 发现异常声学模式与对称性破缺应变相关，且其能量与磁激发能标一致，表明自旋Jahn-Teller效应与磁弹性涨落相关。

Conclusion: CoTi2O5的自旋Jahn-Teller效应源于协同磁弹性涨落，而非传统的软临界动力学。

Abstract: CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ has the paradox that low temperature static magnetic order
is incompatible with the crystal structure owing to a mirror plane that exactly
frustrates magnetic interactions. Despite no observable structural distortion
with diffraction, CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ does magnetically order below $T_{\rm N}$
$\sim$ 25 K with the breaking of spin ground state degeneracy proposed to be a
realization of the spin Jahn-Teller effect in analogy to the celebrated orbital
Jahn-Teller transition. We apply neutron and Raman spectroscopy to study the
dynamics of this transition in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$. We find anomalous acoustics
associated with a symmetry breaking strain that characterizes the spin
Jahn-Teller transition. Crucially, the energy of this phonon coincides with the
energy scale of the magnetic excitations, and has the same symmetry of an optic
mode, observed with Raman spectroscopy, which atypically softens in energy with
decreasing temperature. Taken together, we propose that the energetics of the
spin Jahn-Teller effect in CoTi$_{2}$O$_{5}$ are related to cooperative
magnetoelastic fluctuations as opposed to conventional soft critical dynamics
which typically drive large measurable static displacements.

Conclusion: 重向列态的发现丰富了关联系统的相图，为研究Kondo物理、自发对称性破缺和量子临界性提供了新平台。

Abstract: The Kondo lattice mode, as one of the most fundamental models in condensed
matter physics, has been employed to describe a wide range of quantum materials
such as heavy fermions, transition metal dichalcogenides and two-dimensional
Moire systems. Discovering new phases on Kondo lattice and unveiling their
mechanisms are crucial to the understanding of strongly correlated systems.
Here, in a layered Kondo magnet USbTe, we observe a spin-textured nematic state
and visualize a heavy electronic liquid-crystal phase. Employing scanning
tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we visualize a tetragonal
symmetry breaking of heavy electronic states around the Fermi level. Through
systematically investigating the temperature and energy dependence of
spectroscopic data, we find that the nematic state coincides with the formation
of heavy quasi-particles driven by band hybridization. Remarkably, using spin
polarized STM, we demonstrate that the nematic state is spin polarized, which
not only suggests its intrinsically electronic nature, but also represents the
unique magnetic texture of nematic heavy fermions. Our findings unveil a novel
correlation-mediated order whose mechanism is inherently tied to Kondo-lattice
physics. The observation of heavy nematic states enriches the phase diagram of
correlated systems and provides a rare platform to explore the interplay of
Kondo physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking and quantum criticality.

Conclusion: 钴铁氧体中存在受挫的轨道态，涉及Jahn-Teller畸变、轨道玻璃行为，为尖晶石系统中自由度的耦合提供了新见解。

Abstract: The structural distortions, orbital correlations, and electronic states in
cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) were investigated using complementary characterisation
techniques, including SR-XRD, HAXPES, XANES, EXAFS, and Raman spectroscopy.
SR-XRD confirms phase purity and reveals a temperature-dependent superlattice
reflection between 200 K and 100 K, consistent with the emergence of
short-range orbital ordering driven by cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion
(JTD). The disappearance of this feature below 100 K signals orbital freezing
and the onset of a glass-like orbital state. HAXPES measurements show multiplet
splitting and charge-transfer satellite features in the Co and Fe 2p core
levels, indicating mixed valence states and strong electron correlations. XANES
analysis reveals hybridized p-d states and local coordination distortions.
Temperature-dependent EXAFS measurements indicate increasing local
disorder-particularly in Fe-O and Fe-Fe octahedral bonds as evidenced by
enhanced Debye-Waller factors. These distortions, attributed to cation
redistribution and oxygen vacancies, are static and asymmetric, primarily
affecting the octahedral sublattice. Notably, signatures of cooperative
Jahn-Teller distortions emerge in the intermediate temperature range (200-100
K) and disappear upon further cooling. Raman spectroscopy further supports
these findings, revealing phonon anomalies and enhanced spin-phonon coupling in
the same temperature range. Magnetic measurements indicate spin reorientation
and exchange interaction anomalies that align with the orbital behaviour.
Together, these results hint at a frustrated orbital state in CoFe2O4 possibly
involving cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions, disrupted long-range coherence,
and orbital glass behaviour offering new insights into the coupling of orbital,
spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in spinel systems.

Conclusion: 量子临界效应可在超导相变中存活，且Andreev-复兴现象为TFD/虫洞相变提供了实验可检测的签名。

Abstract: We show that two Yukawa-SYK models with a weak tunneling contact can have an
exotic hybrid superconducting thermofield-double-like state that is
holographically dual to a traversable wormhole connecting two black holes with
charged scalar hair. The hybrid superconducting thermo-field-double/wormhole
state is distinguishable by anomalous scaling of revival oscillations in the
fermionic Green's function, but also in a unique Andreev-revival in the
anomalous Green's function. The existence of this TFD/wormhole state
surprisingly shows that the some quantum critical effects can survive the phase
transition to superconductivity. This Andreev-revival is in principle an
accessible signature of the transition to the TFD/wormhole phase detectable in
the ac-Josephson current.
