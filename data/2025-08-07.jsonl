In recent years, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies\nare not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring\ntheoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect\nMatching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can\neffectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by\nrigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT)\narchitecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first\nis a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels,\nwhile the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the\ntheoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from\nGoogle, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the\nknowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training\nloss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of\napproximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess\na high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from\nreal hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models."}

In the clean limit, the AAH model undergoes a localization\ntransition from an extended phase to a localized phase via an intermediate\ncritical phase as the strength of the quasiperiodic potential is varied. While\nthe staggered potential merely shifts the critical point to a lower value,\nFibonacci and Thue-Morse potentials induce immediate localization. This\ncontrast reveals the sensitivity of localization behavior to the structural\ncomplexity of the potential, with the onset of localization correlating with\nthe sequence's complexity. More specifically, the system follows a hierarchy\ndefined by the complexity measures of the applied potentials. In addition, the\ntypical fidelity susceptibility exhibits a power-law scaling behavior at the\nlocalization transition, enabling reliable extraction of the critical exponent.\nWe focus on the AAH model with the Fibonacci potential due to its minimal\nfinite-size effects compared to other cases. For the disordered AAH model with\nthe Fibonacci potential, we determine critical exponents that differ from those\nof the AAH model without disorder and the Anderson model. Moreover, despite\ndifferences in localization behavior, we find that the disordered AAH models\nwith the staggered potential and the Fibonacci potential share the same\ncorrelation-length critical exponent.

For the most part, compilation methods\nhave aimed at being generic, able to map any input circuit into executables on\nthe hardware, and therefore cannot appropriately exploit these properties and\nresult in executables which have higher physical error. In the case of modular\ntrapped ion systems, specifically QCCDs, this corresponds to the insertion of\nexcessive shuttling operations necessary to realize arbitrary qubit\ninteractions. We propose a compilation scheme explicitly tailored for the\nstructural regularity of QEC circuits based on several key observations: 1.\nonly ancilla or data (but not both) should be shuttled, 2. stabilizers can be\nexecuted in any order meaning we can dynamically modify circuit execution on a\nper-cycle basis 3. ancilla are indistinguishable meaning any can be selected to\nbegin a stabilizer measurement and retain a fixed-point mapping between cycles,\nand 4.

Building on previous results by Zhang et al.,\narXiv:2304.04526, at each step the algorithm either returns the current state,\napplies a trace non-increasing completely positive map, or restarts depending\non the outcomes of a biased coin flip and an ancilla measurement. We introduce\na deterministic stopping rule which leads to an efficient algorithm with a\nbounded expected number of calls to a block-encoding and a state preparation\ncircuit representing the two input matrices of the Lyapunov equations. We also\nconsider approximating the normalized inverse of a positive definite matrix $A$\nwith condition number $\\kappa$ up to trace distance error $\\epsilon$. For this\nspecial case the algorithm requires, in expectation, at most $\\lceil\n\\kappa\\ln(1/\\epsilon) \\rceil+1$ calls to a block-encoding of $\\sqrt{A/\\|A\\|}$.\nThis matches the optimal query complexity in $\\kappa$ and $\\epsilon$ of the\nrelated, but distinct, quantum linear system solvers. In its most general form,\nthe algorithm generates mixed states which approximate matrix-valued weighted\nsums and integrals."}

Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors,\nwe map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes\nthe band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly\ndissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a\ntopologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s\nrigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property. Thus, there is no robust\ndissipation-free edge modes protected by the bulk topology in quadratic open\nfermions, under any unitary or anti-unitary symmetries. Our result applies to\ngeneric quadratic fermionic Lindbladians, requiring only gapped bulk and\nbounded spectrum for technical convenience.

Such a squeezed state is called the geometrically squeezed state.\nHowever, for interacting BECs with two-body collisions, a similar quench only\nresults in quantum fluctuations oscillating periodically without squeezing. In\nthis work, we identify superfluid stability as the key factor behind this\nnon-squeezing phenomenon, with the periodic oscillations arising from\ncollective excitations of a stable collective excitation mode. By strategically\nbreaking the stability criteria, we propose a dynamical approach for generating\nsqueezing that can exponentially suppress quantum fluctuations in a relatively\nshort time, surpassing the efficiency of existing experimental preparation\nschemes."}

In the clean limit, the AAH model undergoes a localization\ntransition from an extended phase to a localized phase via an intermediate\ncritical phase as the strength of the quasiperiodic potential is varied. While\nthe staggered potential merely shifts the critical point to a lower value,\nFibonacci and Thue-Morse potentials induce immediate localization. This\ncontrast reveals the sensitivity of localization behavior to the structural\ncomplexity of the potential, with the onset of localization correlating with\nthe sequence's complexity. More specifically, the system follows a hierarchy\ndefined by the complexity measures of the applied potentials. In addition, the\ntypical fidelity susceptibility exhibits a power-law scaling behavior at the\nlocalization transition, enabling reliable extraction of the critical exponent.\nWe focus on the AAH model with the Fibonacci potential due to its minimal\nfinite-size effects compared to other cases. For the disordered AAH model with\nthe Fibonacci potential, we determine critical exponents that differ from those\nof the AAH model without disorder and the Anderson model. Moreover, despite\ndifferences in localization behavior, we find that the disordered AAH models\nwith the staggered potential and the Fibonacci potential share the same\ncorrelation-length critical exponent. These findings provide a unified\nframework for understanding localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems\nand are amenable to experimental validation using emerging techniques."}
