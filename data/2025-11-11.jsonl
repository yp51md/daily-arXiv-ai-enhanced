Depending on\nthe height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex\nrings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound\nvelocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The\nShapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first,\nsecond, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary\nexcitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and\nmulti-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full\ncrossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction\ndynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights\ninto leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via\nboundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes.

Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of\ndriven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter\nregimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate\ndifferent dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using\nparametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that\nare dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr\ninteractions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between\nKerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the\ncoupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for\nrealizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as\nwell as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously\nunexplored interaction regimes."}

However, the QBs\ninevitably losses energy due to their interaction with environment. How to\nenhance the performance of the QBs in the open-system case remains an important\nchallenge. Here we propose a scheme to realize the driven-dissipative QBs in\natom-waveguide-QED systems and demonstrate significant improvements in both the\nstored energy and extractable work (ergotropy) of the QBs via feedback control.\nFor a single-atom QB, we show that combining the measurement and coherent\nfeedback controls enables nearly perfect stable charging under the weak\ncoherent driving. For the QB array, the measurement-based feedback allows us to\ncontrol different dynamical phases in the thermodynamic limit: (i) a continuous\nboundary time-crystal phase, where persistent periodic energy charge-discharge\noscillations emerge despite the presence of the dissipation into the waveguide,\nand (ii) two stationary phases -- one reaches full charge while the other\nmaintains only small energy storage.
