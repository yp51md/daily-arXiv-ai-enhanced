*Naoki Shibuya*

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通过调制导线电流移动磁陷阱时导致的约束变形、参数加热和原子损失问题。

Method: 基于逆优化的快速模拟框架，计算导线电流调度以实现原子传输并恢复陷阱几何形状。

Result: 评估了2.4 mm轨迹上不同传输时间（2s至5s）下的陷阱最小能量、横向位移、约束轮廓和绝热性参数。

Conclusion: 展示了速度与绝热性之间的权衡，为原子芯片上的原子传输提供了优化方案。

Abstract: Modulating wire currents to shift a magnetic trap along an atom chip enables
smooth contact-free delivery of Bose-Einstein condensates but can deform the
confinement profile causing parametric heating and atom loss. We introduce a
fast simulation framework based on inverse optimization that, given an initial
trap and a predefined trajectory over time, computes a wire current schedule
that transports the atoms and restores the trap geometry upon arrival. We
assess trap's minimum energy, lateral displacement, confinement profile and an
adiabaticity parameter over a 2.4 mm trajectory for various transport durations
between 2s and 5s, demonstrating the trade-off between speed and adiabaticity.

Abstract: Accurately estimating ground-state energies of quantum many-body systems is
still a challenging computational task because of the exponential growth of the
Hilbert space with the system size. Sample-based diagonalization (SBD) methods
address this problem by projecting the Hamiltonian onto a subspace spanned by a
selected set of basis configurations. In this article, we introduce two neural
network-enhanced approaches for SBD: sample-based neural diagonalization (SND)
and adaptive-basis SND (AB-SND). Both employ autoregressive neural networks to
efficiently sample relevant basis configurations, with AB-SND additionally
optimizing a parameterized basis transformation so that the ground-state wave
function becomes more concentrated. We consider different classes of basis
transformations: single-spin and non-overlapping two-spin rotations, which are
tractable on classical computers, and also more expressive global unitaries
that can be implemented using quantum circuits. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of these techniques on various quantum Ising models, showing that
SND achieves high accuracy for concentrated ground states, while AB-SND
consistently outperforms both SND and more conventional SBD methods, allowing
entering regimes in which the ground state is not concentrated in the original
computational basis.

Abstract: We probe the motion of a 6 $\mu g$ magnetically levitated superconducting

Abstract: Shadow tomography protocols have recently emerged as powerful tools for
efficient quantum state learning, aiming to reconstruct expectation values of
observables with fewer resources than traditional quantum state tomography. For
the particular case of estimating Pauli observables, entangling two-copy
measurement schemes can offer an exponential improvement in sample complexity
over any single-copy strategy conceivable [1, Huang, Kueng, Preskill,
PRL(2021)]. A recent refinement of these ideas by King et al. [2, King, Gosset,
Kothari, Babbush, SODA (2025)] does not only achieve polynomial sample
complexity, but also maintains reasonable computational demands and utilizes
joint measurements on only a small constant number of state copies. This
`triple efficiency' is achievable for any subset of $n$-qubit Pauli
observables, whereas single-copy strategies can only be efficient if the Pauli
observables have advantageous structure. In this work, we complement existing
theoretical performance guarantees with the empirical evaluation of triply
efficient shadow tomography using classical, noise-free simulations. Our
findings indicate that the empirical sample complexity aligns closely with
theoretical predictions for stabilizer states and, notably, demonstrates
slightly improved scaling for random Gibbs states compared to established
theoretical bounds. In addition, we improve a central subroutine in the
triply-efficient shadow protocol by leveraging insights from a refined quantum
and quantum-inspired convex optimization algorithm [3, Henze et al.
arXiv:2502.15426 (2025)]. To summarize, our empirical sample complexity studies
of triply efficient shadow tomography not only confirm existing theoretical
scaling behavior, but also showcase that the actual constants involved are
comparatively benign. Hence, this protocol has the potential to also be very
sample-efficient in practice.

Method: 基于有限维算子代数和概念格构造，提出组合条件，避免特定子结构$C_3$，并限制输入输出间路径数量。

Result: 确定了满足无影响约束的酉变换存在酉因果分解的组合条件，即$G$中无$C_3$子结构且$L_G$中每对输入输出路径不超过一条。

Conclusion: 证明了酉因果分解的存在性及其组合特征，为量子因果性与电路设计的联系提供了理论基础。

Abstract: If a unitary transformation has a decomposition into a quantum circuit with
no directed path from input $a$ to output $b$, then $a$ does not influence $b$
through the overall unitary. Conversely, it is known that if $a$ does not
influence $b$, one may always find a circuit decomposition lacking a path
between these systems, thus making the no-influence condition directly apparent
in the connectivity of the circuit. Causal decompositions are circuit
decompositions in which, more generally, multiple such no-influence conditions
are made apparent simultaneously. They bridge two fundamental concepts in
quantum causality: causal structure, as expressed by influences through unitary
transformations (and related to signalling through quantum channels); and
compositional structure, expressed in terms of the shape of quantum circuits or
networks. The general existence of causal decompositions remains unknown.
  This work focusses on unitary causal decompositions, i.e. decompositions in
terms of unitary circuits in the traditional quantum circuit formalism that do
not require the generalisation to `extended' or `routed' quantum circuits
prompted by earlier research on this topic. We identify a combinatorial
condition that characterises precisely those sets of causal no-influence
constraints $G$ for which any unitary transformation satisfying $G$ has a
unitary causal decomposition compositionally representing those constraints.
Our methods are based on finite-dimensional operator algebra as well as the
concept lattice construction, which was recently shown to provide a canonical
shape $L_G$ for causal decompositions. The combinatorial condition we identify
can be formulated in terms of $G$ as the absence of a forbidden substructure
$C_3$ and in terms of $L_G$ as the existence of no more than one path between
each input and output.

Abstract: Quantum computing (QC) has gained significant attention over the past two
decades due to its potential for speeding up classically demanding tasks. This
transition from an academic focus to a thriving commercial sector is reflected
in substantial global investments. While advancements in qubit counts and
functionalities continues at a rapid pace, current quantum systems still lack
the scalability for practical applications, facing challenges such as too high
error rates and limited coherence times. This perspective paper examines the
relationship between QC and high-performance computing (HPC), highlighting
their complementary roles in enhancing computational efficiency. It is widely
acknowledged that even fully error-corrected QCs will not be suited for all
computational task. Rather, future compute infrastructures are anticipated to
employ quantum acceleration within hybrid systems that integrate HPC and QC.
While QCs can enhance classical computing, traditional HPC remains essential
for maximizing quantum acceleration. This integration is a priority for
supercomputing centers and companies, sparking innovation to address the
challenges of merging these technologies. The Accelerated Data Analytics and
Computing Institute (ADAC) is comprised of globally leading HPC centers. ADAC
has established a Quantum Computing Working Group to promote and catalyze
collaboration among its members. This paper synthesizes insights from the QC
Working Group, supplemented by findings from a member survey detailing ongoing
projects and strategic directions. By outlining the current landscape and
challenges of QC integration into HPC ecosystems, this work aims to provide HPC
specialists with a deeper understanding of QC and its future implications for
computationally intensive endeavors.

Conclusion: 论文为在量子计算机中实现单自旋子波函数提供了可行方法，并评估了不同策略的效率。

Abstract: We consider the preparation of single-spinon wave functions, relevant for
one-dimensional $S=1/2$ spin models, in a quantum computer. We adopt the
recently proposed ansatz \cite{kulk} for the single-spinon wave function, where
a state with $S=1/2$ is built in a spin chain with $L+1$ sites, adding a site
with $S_z=1/2$ to the configurations of the ground-state wave function for the
spin chain with length $L$. We extend the original work to the case of the
Haldane-Shastry model. We discuss how to prepare the single-spinon ansatz both
for the Heisenberg and Haldane-Shastry models in quantum computers, using a
linear combination of unitaries. We consider three different strategies to
compute the single-spinon energy in a quantum computer and analyze their cost
in terms of the number of qubits, gates, and circuits.

Conclusion: 驱动Rydberg自旋晶格展现出丰富的动力学行为，可用于量子态操控。

Abstract: Rydberg lattice under facilitation conditions can feature kinetic
constraints, leading to ballistic and non-ergodic behavior at different
detuning intensities. Here, we demonstrate that a resonant driving field can
achieve effects similar to those under facilitation conditions. We focus on the
relaxation dynamics of spin clusters in a periodically driven Rydberg spin
lattice. Through an effective Hamiltonian for the domain walls of the spin
cluster, it is shown that when the driving frequency is resonant with the
Rydberg interaction, the spin cluster exhibits ballistic expansion with half
the spreading rate compared to the case of facilitation conditions. However,
near the resonant point, the spin cluster displays confinement behavior of the
Bloch-like oscillations. These results demonstrate the rich dynamic behaviors
in the driven Rydberg spin lattices and may find applications in quantum state
manipulation.

Conclusion: 精确的量子光测量技术对控制物质宏观量子态至关重要。

Abstract: We show that projective measurements on quantum light can induce macroscopic
cat states in many-electron systems driven by large-amplitude cat-state light.
Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of N independent two-level electrons
interacting with Schr\"odinger cat or kitten states of light. Without
measurement, a macroscopic cat state of electrons appears only in an ultrashort
time window. In contrast, we demonstrate that photon-number parity or
quadrature projective measurements can restore a macroscopic cat state in
nonequilibrium electrons, even in the thermodynamic limit. These dynamics are
captured by an external-field approximation, in which the electronic system
evolves into a Rabi-oscillation cat state. Our results highlight the need for
precise quantum measurement techniques for light to control macroscopic quantum
states of matter driven by quantum light.

Conclusion: 本文扩展了上下文性收获的适用范围，并提出了新的收获标准和工具，为量子资源理论提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not
admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the
source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It
has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local
entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to
Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is
introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting
quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In
particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest
contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested
contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be
larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt
qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain
tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the
harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting
regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of
contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as
general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local
entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are
put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible
harvesting parameter regimes.

short-range XY model. We also analyze in detail a specific static geometry that
significantly suppresses decoherence. These general methods as applied to

Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum
walks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is
periodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a
classicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium
Markovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such
systems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their
equilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov
dynamics [G. Teza {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we
demonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only
first-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue
crossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic
models: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line
with internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for
breaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical
behavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization
enables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental
interest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies,
including quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of
controllable non-equilibrium quantum states.

Abstract: Conventionally, covariances do not distinguish between spatial and temporal
correlations. The same covariance matrix could equally describe temporal
correlations between observations of the same system at two different times or
correlations made on two spatially separated systems that arose from some
common cause. Here, we demonstrate Gaussian quantum correlations that are
atemporal, such that the covariances governing their quadrature measurements
are unphysical without postulating some common cause. We introduce Gaussian
atemporality robustness as a measure of atemporality, illustrating its
efficient computability and operational meaning as the minimal noise needed to
remove this uniquely quantum phenomenon. We illustrate that (i) specific
spatiotemporal Gaussian correlations possess an intrinsic arrow of time, such
that Gaussian atemporality robustness is zero in one temporal direction and not
the other and (ii) that it measures quantum correlations beyond entanglement.

Abstract: Studying adversarial robustness of quantum machine learning (QML) models is
essential in order to understand their potential advantages over classical
models and build trustworthy systems. Distributing QML models allows leveraging
multiple quantum processors to overcome the limitations of individual devices
and build scalable systems. However, this distribution can affect their
adversarial robustness, potentially making them more vulnerable to new attacks.
Key paradigms in distributed QML include federated learning, which, similar to
classical models, involves training a shared model on local data and sending
only the model updates, as well as circuit distribution methods inherent to
quantum computing, such as circuit cutting and teleportation-based techniques.
These quantum-specific methods enable the distributed execution of quantum
circuits across multiple devices. This work reviews the differences between
these distribution methods, summarizes existing approaches on the adversarial
robustness of QML models when distributed using each paradigm, and discusses
open questions in this area.

Abstract: Phases of matter with volume-law entanglement are frequently observed in
quantum circuits and have numerous applications, ranging from deepening our
understanding of quantum mechanics to advancements in quantum computing and
cryptography. Their capacity to host entangled, complex quantum information is
complemented by their ability to efficiently obscure it from quantum
measurements through scrambling, reminiscent of quantum error-correction.
However, the issue of initial-state decodability has primarily been studied in
measurement-only models with area-law phases, which limit the entanglement of
the encoded state. In this work, we introduce a class of Clifford circuits in
one and two dimensions that feature a decodable volume law phase, allowing for
information retrieval in logarithmic circuit depths. We present the Sign-Color
Decoder that tracks stabilizers revealing the initial state, akin to monitoring
a dynamically-changing syndrome for error-correcting codes. We demonstrate this
approach in scenarios where error locations are either known or unknown to the
decoder, and we provide new insights about the relationship between the
decodability transition and measurement-induced phase transition. We propose
that this decodability transition is universal across various settings,
including different circuit geometries. Our findings pave the way for using
volume law states as encoders with mid-circuit measurements, opening potential
applications in quantum error correction and quantum cryptography.

Abstract: Simulating vibrational dynamics is essential for understanding molecular
structure, unlocking useful applications such as vibrational spectroscopy for
high-fidelity chemical detection. Quantum algorithms for vibrational dynamics
are emerging as a promising alternative to resource-demanding classical
approaches, but this domain is largely underdeveloped compared to quantum
simulations of electronic structure. In this work, we describe in detail three
distinct forms of the vibrational Hamiltonian: canonical bosonic quantization,
real space representation, and the Christiansen second-quantized form.
Leveraging Lie algebraic properties of each, we develop efficient fragmentation
schemes to enable the use of Trotter product formulas for simulating time
evolution. We introduce circuits required to implement time evolution in each
form, and highlight factors that contribute to the simulation cost, including
the choice of vibrational coordinates. Using a perturbative approach for the
Trotter error, we obtain tight estimates of T gate cost for the simulation of
time evolution in each form, enabling their quantitative comparison. Combining
tight Trotter error estimates and efficient fragmentation schemes, we find that
for the medium-sized CH$_4$ molecule with 9 vibrational modes, time evolution
for approximately 1.8 ps may be simulated using as little as 36 qubits and
approximately $3 \times 10^{8}$ T gates -- an order-of-magnitude speedup over
prior-art algorithms. Finally, we present calculations of vibrational spectra
using each form to demonstrate the fidelity of our algorithms. This work
presents a unified and highly optimized framework that makes simulating
vibrational dynamics an attractive use case for quantum computers.

Result: 实验结果表明，迁移技术显著减少了所需迭代次数，同时保持了可接受的成本值。

Conclusion: 多目标量子优化具有潜力，为可扩展的多目标量子优化提供了基础。

Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-target quantum optimization, where the
objective is to simultaneously optimize multiple cost functions defined over
the same quantum search space. To accelerate optimization and reduce quantum
resource usage, we investigate a range of strategies that enable knowledge
transfer between related tasks. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage
framework consisting of a training phase where solutions are progressively
shared across tasks and an inference phase, where unoptimized targets are
initialized based on prior optimized ones. We propose and evaluate several
methods, including warm-start initialization, parameter estimation via
first-order Taylor expansion, hierarchical clustering with D-level trees, and
deep learning-based transfer. Our experimental results, using parameterized
quantum circuits implemented with PennyLane, demonstrate that transfer
techniques significantly reduce the number of required iterations while
maintaining an acceptable cost value. These findings highlight the promise of
multi-target generalization in quantum optimization pipelines and provide a
foundation for scalable multi-target quantum optimization.

Abstract: Quantum coherence constitutes a fundamental physical mechanism essential to
the study of quantum algorithms. We study the coherence and decoherence in
generalized Shor's algorithm where the register $A$ is initialized in arbitrary
pure state, or the combined register $AB$ is initialized in any pseudo-pure
state, which encompasses the standard Shor's algorithm as a special case. We
derive both the lower and upper bounds on the performance of the generalized
Shor's algorithm, and establish the relation between the probability of
calculating $r$ when the register $AB$ is initialized in any pseudo-pure state
and the one when the register $A$ initialized in arbitrary pure state.
Moreover, we study the coherence and decoherence in noisy Shor's algorithm and
give the lower bound of the probability that we can calculate $r$.

Abstract: Information scrambling is a phenomenon observed in a wide range of quantum
systems, in which initially localized information becomes distributed across
the entire system. Clarifying the essence of this phenomenon is made possible
by quantum resource theory, which provides an axiomatic framework for
quantifying various forms of quantumness. Within this framework, information
scrambling can be classified into two distinct types: entanglement scrambling
and magic scrambling. Although each has been analyzed individually through
their respective resource theories, such separate treatments fail to capture
the inherent trade-off between them. In this study, we introduce a unified
measure of the two types of scrambling, grounded in resource-theoretic
principles. This unified approach reveals a rigorous trade-off relationship
between entanglement and magic scrambling, as the exact maximum value of the
proposed measure can be derived analytically. Furthermore, we quantify the
scrambling capability of unitary transformations in terms of their ability to
amplify this measure.

Abstract: We propose a Quantum Machine Learning (QML) framework that leverages quantum
parallelism to process entire training datasets in a single quantum operation,
addressing the computational bottleneck of sequential data processing in both
classical and quantum settings. Building on the structural analogy between
feature extraction in foundational quantum algorithms and parameter
optimization in QML, we embed a standard parameterized quantum circuit into an
integrated architecture that encodes all training samples into a quantum
superposition and applies classification in parallel. This approach reduces the
theoretical complexity of loss function evaluation from $O(N^2)$ in
conventional QML training to $O(N)$, where $N$ is the dataset size. Numerical
simulations on multiple binary and multi-class classification datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves classification accuracies comparable to
conventional circuits while offering substantial training time savings. These
results highlight the potential of quantum-parallel data processing as a
scalable pathway to efficient QML implementations.

Abstract: We investigate whether or not irradiation by squeezed light can provide an
enhancement of the two-photon excitation of a system over irradiation by
classical light. Our emphasis is not only on whether or not there is such an
enhancement, but also on whether or not any enhancement can be reasonably
detected in an experiment. We begin by developing a model that includes
radiative and nonradiative broadening to calculate the total scattered and
absorbed energy. As an example calculation, we consider cesium atoms in a
magneto-optical trap, and evaluate the fluorescence emission when driven by
non-degenerate classical and squeezed light, in both the continuous-wave and
pulsed regimes. We find that squeezed light can provide an enhancement in both
regimes under ideal circumstances. These enhancements are in principle
detectable. However, we stress that they are moderate at best compared to
recently reported values for molecular systems.

Result: 量子算法（如Wesolowski和Piddock的算法）在短路径场景下具有更优的渐近性能，而经典算法在长路径场景下仍占优势。

Conclusion: 量子优势的追求是一个动态竞争过程，经典算法的进步不断改变目标。论文为未来量子算法开发提供了更新视角。

Abstract: The Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem is a cornerstone of computer
science with vast applications, for which Dijkstra's algorithm has long been
the classical baseline. While various quantum algorithms have been proposed,
their performance has typically been benchmarked against this decades-old
approach. This landscape was recently reshaped by the introduction of a new
classical algorithm by Duan et al. with a complexity of $O(m \cdot (\log
n)^{2/3})$. This development necessitates a re-evaluation of the quantum
advantage narrative for SSSP. In this paper, we conduct a systematic
theoretical comparison of modern quantum and classical SSSP algorithms in light
of this new classical frontier. Through an analysis of their theoretical cost
functions, we illustrate how their relative scaling compares across scenarios
that vary in graph density and path length. Our analysis suggests a nuanced
picture: sophisticated quantum algorithms, such as the one by Wesolowski and
Piddock, can exhibit more favorable asymptotic scaling, but only in regimes
characterized by short solution paths. Conversely, for problems involving long
paths, state-of-the-art classical algorithms appear to maintain a scaling
advantage. Our work provides an updated perspective for future quantum
algorithm development and underscores that the pursuit of quantum advantage is
a dynamic race where the classical goalposts are continually shifting.

Conclusion: 量子因果指数为量子系统中的因果分析提供了新工具，揭示了因果影响的传播特性。

Abstract: The concept of causality is fundamental to numerous scientific explanations;
nonetheless, its extension to the quantum regime has yet to be explored
rigorously. This paper introduces the development of a quantum causal index, a
novel extension of the classical causal inference framework, tailored to grasp
the causal relationships inherent in quantum systems. Our study focuses on the
asymmetric quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), incorporating the von
Neumann entropy, as a directional metric of causal influence in quantum
many-body systems. We analyze spin chains using the QCMI, implementing a
projective measurement on one site as the intervention and monitoring its
effect on a distant site conditioned on intermediate spins. Additionally, we
study the effective causal propagation velocity, which is the speed at which
QCMI becomes significant at distant sites. These findings indicate the presence
of finite-speed propagation of causal influence, along with the emergence of
coherent oscillations.

Conclusion: MPS方法为量子湍流研究提供了高效工具，支持更大系统规模的模拟，有望揭示新物理现象。

Abstract: Quantum turbulence spans length scales from the system size $L$ to the
healing length $\xi$, making direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation computationally expensive when $L \gg \xi$. We
present a matrix product state (MPS) solver for the GP equation that
efficiently compresses the wavefunction by truncating weak interlength-scale
correlations. This approach reduces memory use by factors ranging from 10x to
over 10,000x compared to DNS. We benchmark our approach on nonlinear
excitations, namely dark solitons (1D) and quantized vortices (2D, 3D),
capturing key dynamics like Kelvin wave propagation and vortex ring emission in
the case of vortex line reconnection. For turbulent states composed of multiple
nonlinear excitations, we find that the memory compression of the MPS
representation is directly proportional to the soliton or vortex densities. We
also accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation
functions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic
energy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the
representative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave
the way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited
system sizes to uncover possible new physics.

Abstract: In the absence of decoherence the current of fermionic particles across a
finite lattice connecting two reservoirs (leads) with different chemical
potentials is known to be ballistic. It is also known that decoherence
typically suppresses this ballistic current. However, if decoherence is weak,
the change in the current may be undetectable. In this work we show that the
effect of a weak decoherence can be amplified by orders of magnitude if the
lattice has edge states.

Abstract: Uncertainty relations for Hermitian operators have been confirmed through
many experiments. However, previous experiments have only tested the special
case of non-Hermitian operators, i.e., uncertainty relations for unitary
operators. In this study, we explore uncertainty relations for general
non-Hermitian operators, which include Hermitian and unitary operators as
special cases. We perform experiments with both real and complex non-Hermitian
operators for qubit states, and confirm the validity of the uncertainty
relations within the experimental error. Our results provide experimental
evidence of uncertainty relations for non-Hermitian operators. Furthermore, our
methods for realizing and measuring non-Hermitian operators are valuable in
characterizing open-system dynamics and enhancing parameter estimation.

Abstract: Developing telecom-compatible spin-photon interfaces is essential towards

while preserving long optical and spin coherence remains an open challenge. We
explore a new platform of Er$^{3+}$:CeO$_2$ films on silicon, offering low
nuclear spin density and the potential for on-chip integration. We demonstrate
a 38.8 $\mu$s spin coherence, which can be extended to 176.4\nobreakspace

Abstract: Reliable and robust control lies at the core of implementing quantum
information processing with diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers. However,
control pulses inevitably introduce multiple errors, leading to decoherence and
hindering scalable applications. Here, we experimentally report an
experiment-friendly multiple-noise-resilient nonadiabatic geometric quantum
gate~(MNR-NGQG) that can significantly improve conventional dynamical gate in
both robustness and coherence. Notably, even when the detuning fluctuation
range is comparable to the maximum Rabi frequency, the single-qubit gate
performance of the MNR-NGQG remains almost unchanged. Besides, the coherence
time of the electron spin is significantly extended to 690 $\pm$ 30 $ \mu$s,
3.5 times that of the naive dynamical counterpart. As a result, the fidelity of
single-qubit gates reaches 0.9992(1), as characterized by quantum process
tomography. With its experimentally feasible design and relaxed hardware
requirements, our work offers a solid paradigm for achieving high-fidelity
quantum control in NV center system, paving the way for practical applications

Conclusion: 部分转置操作可视为时空交换的量子力学描述，暗示黑洞事件视界穿越可能由部分转置描述。

Abstract: While the partial transpose operation appears in many fundamental results in
quantum theory -- such as the Peres-Horodecki criterion for entanglement
detection -- a physical interpretation of the partial transpose is lacking. In
this work, we show that a partial transpose of a bipartite density operator is
a two-time pseudo-density operator, which by definition encodes temporal
correlations associated with two-point sequential measurement scenarios. As
such, it follows that partial transposition admits a precise physical
interpretation as mapping spatial correlations to temporal correlations, thus
swapping the roles of space and time for bipartite quantum systems. For
maximally entangled qubits, we show that partial transposition maps spatial
correlations which violate Bell inequalities to causal correlations which
cannot be replicated by spacelike separated systems, thus further solidifying
the interpretation of partial transpose as a space-time swap. As it is known
that gravitational effects swap the roles of space and time inside a black
hole, our results suggest that at a quantum mechanical level, a traversal of a
black hole's event horizon by a bipartite quantum system may be described by a
partial transpose.

and the corresponding physical properties of the systems are analyzed through
phase diagrams of the energy excitation gaps for different charge and spin
configurations.

single bosonic mode provides a large Hilbert space to redundantly encode
quantum information. However, previous studies have been limited to exploiting
symmetries in the quadrature phase space. Here we introduce a unified framework
for encoding a qubit utilizing the symmetries in the phase space of number and
phase variables of a bosonic mode. The logical codewords form lattice
structures in the number-phase space, resulting in rectangular, oblique, and
diamond-shaped lattice codes. Notably, oblique and diamond codes exhibit a
number-phase vortex effect, where number-shift errors induce discrete phase
rotations as syndromes, enabling efficient correction via phase measurements.
These codes show significant performance advantages over conventional
quadrature codes against dephasing noise in the potential one-way quantum
communication applications. Our generalized number-phase codes open up new
possibilities for fault-tolerant quantum computation and extending the quantum
communication range with bosonic systems.

Abstract: Physical reservoir computing provides a powerful machine learning paradigm
that exploits nonlinear physical dynamics for efficient information processing.
By incorporating quantum effects, quantum reservoir computing gains superior
potential in machine learning applications, for the quantum dynamics are
exponentially costly to simulate classically. Here, we present a novel quantum
reservoir computing approach based on correlated quantum spin systems,
exploiting natural quantum many-body interactions to generate reservoir
dynamics, thereby circumventing the practical challenges of deep quantum
circuits. Our experimental implementation supports nontrivial quantum
entanglement and exhibits sufficient dynamical complexity for high-performance
machine learning. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in experiments on
standard time-series benchmarks, reducing prediction error by one to two orders
of magnitude compared to previous quantum reservoir experiments. In long-term
weather forecasting, our 9-spin quantum reservoir delivers greater prediction
accuracy than classical reservoirs with thousands of nodes. This represents a
first experimental demonstration of quantum machine learning outperforming
large-scale classical models on real-world tasks.

Abstract: Flow matching has rapidly become a dominant paradigm in classical generative

Flow Matching (QFM)-a fully quantum-circuit realization that offers efficient
interpolation between two density matrices. QFM offers systematic preparation
of density matrices and generation of samples for accurately estimating

costly circuit redesigns. We validate its versatility on a set of applications:
(i) generating target states with prescribed magnetization and entanglement
entropy, (ii) estimating nonequilibrium free-energy differences to test the
quantum Jarzynski equality, and (iii) expediting the study on superdiffusion
breakdown. These results position QFM as a unifying and promising framework for
generative modeling across quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is an emerging field that has the potential
to revolutionize computation by taking advantage of quantum physics concepts in
a distributed machine learning (ML) environment. However, the majority of
available quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit
simulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks
such as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore,
designing and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and
resource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model
convergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during
training with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current
simulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training
purposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we
introduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL
experiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time,
epoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to
monitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL
offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of
use and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the
number of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum
hyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator
suitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback
following each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically
illustrating learning curves. SimQFL is a practical and interactive platform
enabling academics and developers to prototype, analyze, and tune quantum
neural networks with greater transparency and control in distributed quantum
networks.

Conclusion: QLI有望为药物-受体相互作用的计算模型提供实验验证的新途径。

Abstract: The characterization of ligand--receptor interactions is a cornerstone of
modern pharmacology; however, current methods are hampered by limitations such
as ensemble averaging and invasive labeling. We propose a theoretical quantum
sensing solution, the Quantum Ligand-Binding Interrogator (QLI), designed to
overcome these challenges. The QLI is a differential sensor, or gradiometer,
that uses a pair of co-trapped atomic ions to perform label-free detection of
the electric field gradient produced by a single ligand binding to its receptor
in vitrified samples. This gradiometric approach provides robust common-mode
rejection of background electric field noise. To bridge the gap between the
cryogenic, ultra-high-vacuum environment required for the sensor and the
biological sample, we propose an architecture based on a vitrified sample
mounted on a scanning probe. This enables the detection of the electrostatic
signature of a single molecule in a specific conformational state (e.g., bound
vs.\ unbound). This paper details the conceptual framework of the QLI, the
experimental architecture, the measurement protocol using entangled two-ion
spin states, and an analysis of key engineering risks. Anchoring to
state-of-the-art single-ion low-frequency sensitivities
(sub-mV\,m$^{-1}$/\,$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$), we project SNR\,=\,1 in tens of
seconds at a 10\,\textmu m ion--sample separation for $\Delta p \sim 20$\,D,
with feasibility dominated by the (as yet unmeasured) electrostatic stability
of vitrified samples. If realized, QLI would provide direct single-molecule
measurements of binding-induced electric field changes, offering a new path for
experimental validation of computational models of drug--receptor interactions.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子信息处理和核自旋纯化提供了新工具，具有实验可行性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We show how two many-body, generally mixed, quantum states can be swapped via
collective, all-to-all interactions. Specifically, we present an experimentally
relevant implementation for quantum dots that enables coherent exchange of
quantum information between different species of nuclear spins, effectively
achieving a perfect swap gate for qudits formed from these different species.
This process also serves as a tool for nuclear spin purification. The results
are obtained by mapping the problem onto perfect state transfer on a 1D chain.
In the partially polarized limit, we demonstrate that the states can be
exchanged independently of the initial state. We also assess the robustness of
the procedure to decoherence and errors.

Conclusion: 该模型通用性强、部署成本低、准确性高，是保护QKD系统的实用工具。

Abstract: Traditional countermeasures against security side channels in quantum key
distribution (QKD) systems often suffer from poor compatibility with deployed
infrastructure, the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities, and limited
applicability to specific types of attacks. In this work, we propose an anomaly
detection (AD) model based on one-class machine learning algorithms to address
these limitations. By constructing a dataset from the QKD system's operational
states, the AD model learns the characteristics of normal behavior under secure
conditions. When an attack occurs, the system's state deviates from the learned
normal patterns and is identified as anomalous by the model. Experimental
results show that the AD model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding
99\%, effectively safeguarding the QKD system's secure operation. Compared to
traditional approaches, our model can be deployed with minimal cost in existing
QKD networks without requiring additional optical or electrical components,
thus avoiding the introduction of new side channels. Furthermore, unlike
multi-class machine learning algorithms, our approach does not rely on prior
knowledge of specific attack types and is potentially able to detect unknown
attacks. These advantages--generality, ease of deployment, low cost, and high
accuracy--make our model a practical and effective tool for protecting QKD
systems against side-channel threats.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement characterization is a core problem in quantum
information theory, with several classification schemes available. Among these,
the $k$-stretchability, recently introduced [Szalay, Quantum 3, 204 (2019)],
can be used to describe multipartite entanglement structure. Recently, a class
of symmetric measurements (informationally complete $(s,t)$-POVMs) has been
proposed [Siudzi$\textrm{\'{n}}$ska, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{105}, 042209 (2022)]
, which includes GSIC-POVMs and MUMs. In this work, we discuss the detection of
$k$-nonstretchability based on informationally complete $(s,t)$-POVMs and
obtain some $k$-nonstretchability criteria for multipartite quantum systems. It
is shown that these criteria can identify certain $k$-nonstretchable states,
and their practical applicability and advantages are illustrated through
specific examples.

Abstract: Efficient encoding of classical information plays a fundamental role in

deployment on current noisy devices can be challenging. In this work, we
propose an improved Matrix Product State(MPS) method preparation protocol with
an exponential reduction on the circuit depth, as well as topological
adaptability. By refined utilization of the disentangling principle, we also
reduce approximately 33% two-qubit gate count. To validate our method, we study
various families of functions and distributions with provably bounded MPS rank.
Numerical experiments show that our method significantly reduces circuit depth
while achieving higher fidelity for states arising in financial and other
applications.

Conclusion: 灰盒方法为有限数据条件下的量子设备表征和门优化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Characterization and calibration of quantum devices are necessary steps to
achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing. As quantum devices become more
sophisticated, it is increasingly essential to rely not only on physics-based
models, but also on predictive models with open-loop optimization. Therefore,
we choose the Graybox approach, which is composed of an explicit (whitebox)
model describing the known dynamics and an implicit (blackbox) model describing
the noisy dynamics in the form of a deep neural network, to characterize and
calibrate superconducting-qubit devices. By sending a set of selected pulses to
the devices and measuring Pauli expectation values, the Graybox approach can
train the implicit model and optimize gates based on specified loss functions.
We also benchmark our optimized gates on the devices and cross-testing
predictive models with two types of loss functions, i.e., the mean squared
errors (MSE) of expectation values and the absolute errors (AE) of average gate
fidelities (AGF). While the Graybox method allows for flexibility of the
implicit noise model, its construction relies on a finite measurement shots
dataset. We thus apply the decomposition of expected MSE loss to show that the
finite-shot estimation of expectation values is the main contribution to the
minimum value achievable of the expected MSE loss. We also show that the
expected loss is an upper bound of the expected absolute error of AGF between
the exact value and model prediction. Our results provide insights for quantum
device characterization and gate optimization in experiments where only finite
shots of data are available.

Conclusion: BELT协议在样本复杂度上优于基于厄米保持映射指数化的协议，为量子信息处理提供了新工具。

Abstract: Linear maps that are not completely positive play a crucial role in the study
of quantum information, yet their non-completely positive nature renders them
challenging to realize physically. The core difficulty lies in the fact that
when acting such a map $\mathcal{N}$ on a state $\rho$, $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ may
not correspond to a valid density matrix, making it difficult to prepare
directly in a physical system. We introduce Block Encoding of Linear
Transformation (BELT), a systematic protocol that simulates arbitrary linear
maps by embedding the output $\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ into a block of a unitary
operator. BELT enables the manipulation and extraction of information about
$\mathcal{N}(\rho)$ through coherent quantum evolution. Notably, BELT
accommodates maps that fall outside the scope of quantum singular value
transformation, such as the transpose map. BELT finds applications in
entanglement detection, quantum channel inversion, and simulating
pseudo-differential operators, and demonstrates improved sample complexity
compared to protocols based on Hermitian-preserving map exponentiation.

Abstract: Hyperfine-encoded qubits in alkali atoms have established themselves as
robust platforms for quantum computing, while alkaline-earth-like elements
expand the state manipulation toolbox through their rich spectrum of optical
transitions and metastable states. In this work, we demonstrate that thulium is
a viable candidate for quantum computing, combining advantages of hyperfine
qubit encoding with a rich energy-level structure of alkaline-earth-like atoms.
We describe protocols for the initial state preparation and state-selective
readout, and show single-qubit operations on the microwave transition at $1
497$ MHz. We demonstrate ground state hyperfine qubit coherence times up to
$T_2^* = 22^{+2}_{-2}$ s and $T_2 = 55^{+59}_{-14}$ s, representing
record-scale performance for neutral-atom systems. Furthermore, we show
operations involving metastable optical states, including shelving for the
state-selective readout as well as coherent population transfer of the ground
state qubit with coherence time primarily limited by the metastable level
natural lifetime of $112$ ms. These results mark the first step toward using
thulium for quantum computing applications and highlight its promising
characteristics.

Conclusion: 论文为量子资源理论中常见的最大重叠问题提供了操作解释，将其与对称假设检验中的量子Chernoff散度联系起来。

Abstract: We establish a generalized quantum Chernoff bound for the discrimination of
multiple sets of quantum states, thereby extending the classical and quantum
Chernoff bounds to the general setting of composite and correlated quantum
hypotheses. Specifically, we consider the task of distinguishing whether a
quantum system is prepared in a state from one of several convex, compact sets
of quantum states, each of which may exhibit arbitrary correlations. Assuming
their stability under tensor product, we prove that the optimal error exponent
for discrimination is precisely given by the regularized quantum Chernoff
divergence between the sets. Furthermore, leveraging minimax theorems, we show
that discriminating between sets of quantum states is no harder than
discriminating between their worst-case elements in terms of error probability.
This implies the existence of a universal optimal test that achieves the
minimum error probability for all states in the sets, matching the performance
of the optimal test for the most challenging states. We provide explicit
characterizations of the universal optimal test in the binary composite case.
Finally, we show that the maximum overlap between a pure state and a set of
free states, a quantity that frequently arises in quantum resource theories, is
equal to the quantum Chernoff divergence between the sets, thereby providing an
operational interpretation of this quantity in the context of symmetric
hypothesis testing.

Abstract: We study the error exponents in quantum hypothesis testing between two sets
of quantum states, extending the analysis beyond the independent and
identically distributed case to encompass composite and correlated hypotheses.
We introduce and compare two natural extensions of the quantum Hoeffding
divergence and anti-divergence to sets of quantum states, establishing their
equivalence or quantitative relationships. Our main results generalize the
quantum Hoeffding bound to stable sequences of convex, compact sets of quantum
states, demonstrating that the optimal type-I error exponent, under an
exponential constraint on the type-II error, is precisely characterized by the
regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence between the sets. In the strong
converse regime, we provide a lower bound on the exponent in terms of the
regularized quantum Hoeffding anti-divergence. These findings refine the
generalized quantum Stein's lemma and yield a detailed understanding of the
trade-off between type-I and type-II errors in discrimination with composite
correlated hypotheses.

Abstract: Security analysis is a critical part in any cryptographic protocol, may it be
classical or quantum. Without security analysis, one cannot ensure the secrecy
of the distributed keys. To perform a conclusive security analysis, it is very
often necessary to frame the problem as an optimization problem. However,
solving such optimization problems is quite challenging. In this article, we
focus on the security analysis of device-independent quantum key distribution
(DIQKD) with random key basis protocol. We show that the optimization cost of
the existing security analysis can be reduced without compromising the key
rate. In particular, we reframe the entire security analysis of this protocol
as a strongly convex optimization problem and demonstrate that unlike the
original security proof, optimization of Bob's measurement angles for finding a
lower bound on Eve's uncertainty about Alice's key generation basis can be done
with lesser cost. We derive an explicit form of the pessimistic error that
arises while optimizing the measurement angles of both the parties. We also
clarify a few parts of the original security proof, making the analysis more
rigorous and complete.

Abstract: Physicist and Nobel Laureate Richard P. Feynman once remarked ``We choose to
examine a phenomenon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in
any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In
reality, it contains the only mystery. We cannot make the mystery go away by
``explaining'' how it works. We will just tell you how it works. In telling you
how it works, we will have told you about the basic peculiarities of all
quantum mechanics'' [Feynman RP, Leighton RB, Sands M (1963 and 1965)]. The
phenomenon of interference is ubiquitous in the quantum world and indeed holds
within itself the explanation for many counterintuitive quantum phenomena. In
this review, we choose to focus on a few ramifications and manifestations of
quantum interference that have deep implications for the foundations of quantum
mechanics. These include single-photon or second-order interference, two-photon
or fourth-order interference and higher-order interference.

### [49] [Symmetric orthogonalization and probabilistic weights in resource quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12949)
*Gökhan Torun*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Löwdin对称正交化（LSO）在量子资源表征中优于Gram-Schmidt正交化（GSO），特别是在相干性和叠加态的量化中。LSO通过对称变换避免了基选择歧义，并引入Löwdin权重作为非正交表示的概率权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非正交基转换为正交基时可能丢失物理意义或量子资源特性的问题，特别是在量子相干性和叠加态分析中。

Method: 采用LSO方法从非正交基构建正交基或从正交基生成非正交基，避免基选择歧义，并引入Löwdin权重量化资源内容。

Result: LSO比GSO更稳定且能更好地保留量子态对称性和资源特性，Löwdin权重为量子相干性和态离域提供了基无关的量化方法。

Conclusion: LSO和Löwdin权重在量子资源理论中具有重要作用，为相干性和叠加态分析提供了更优的工具。

Abstract: Transforming non-orthogonal bases into orthogonal ones often sacrifices
essential properties or physical meaning in quantum systems. Here, we
demonstrate that L\"owdin symmetric orthogonalization (LSO) outperforms the
widely used Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) in characterizing and
quantifying quantum resources, with particular emphasis on coherence and
superposition. We employ LSO both to construct an orthogonal basis from a
non-orthogonal one and to obtain a non-orthogonal basis from an orthogonal set,
thereby avoiding any ambiguity related to the basis choice for quantum
coherence. Unlike GSO, which depends on the ordering of input states, LSO
applies a symmetric transformation that treats all vectors equally and
minimizes deviation from the original basis. This approach generates basis sets
with enhanced stability and physical relevance, facilitating the analysis of
superpositions in non-orthogonal quantum states. Building on LSO, we also
introduce L\"owdin weights -- probabilistic weights for non-orthogonal
representations that provide a consistent measure of resource content. These
weights further enable basis-independent quantification of coherence and state
delocalization through information-theoretic measures such as entropy and
participation ratios. Our theoretical and numerical analyses confirm LSO's
superior preservation of quantum state symmetry and resource characteristics,
underscoring the critical role of orthogonalization methods and L\"owdin
weights in resource theory frameworks.

Abstract: We consider an example scenario where we require several copies of a pure
quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ for some quantum information processing task. Due
to practical limitations, we only have access to $N = 10^3$ depolarized copies
of $|\psi\rangle$ such that the fidelity $F$ of each copy with $|\psi\rangle$
is $0.75$. We denote this quantum asset with the ensemble $\mathcal{A}: (10^3,
0.75)_{|\psi\rangle}$. A genie appears and offers to trade $\mathcal{A}$ with
either $\mathcal{B}: (10^4, 0.65)_{|\psi\rangle}$ or with $\mathcal{C}: (10^2,
0.90)_{|\psi\rangle}$. Should we accept the trade with either of these two
ensembles? In this article, we attempt to answer this question with arbitrary
$N$ and $F$. More specifically, we derive resource equivalence curves from
quantum resource theory of purity, quantum state distinguishability, quantum
state purification, and quantum state tomography. These curves enable ranking
of these ensembles according to their operational usefulness for these tasks
and allow us to answer the question of trading the aforementioned ensembles.

Conclusion: 非高斯性和不对称性对计量任务有重要影响，为近量子增强传感器提供了实用资源。

Abstract: Quantum metrology aims to enhance measurement precision beyond the standard
quantum limit (SQL), the benchmark set by classical resources, enabling
advances in sensing, imaging, and fundamental physics. A critical milestone
beyond the SQL is surpassing the Gaussian bound -- the fundamental precision
limit achievable with any Gaussian state, such as optimally squeezed states.
Certain non-Gaussian states, specifically asymmetric superpositions of coherent
states (SCS) and superpositions of a vacuum and a Fock state (ON states), can
outperform this Gaussian bound within an intermediate energy range. In
particular, asymmetric SCS emerge as a highly practical resource for near-term
quantum sensing architectures operating beyond the Gaussian limit due to their
efficient preparation and processing via a constant-complexity protocol. Our
comprehensive analysis under realistic loss, noise, and detection schemes
quantifies the critical trade-off between achievable precision and the
operational range of the non-Gaussian advantage. This work sheds light on the
fundamental impact of non-Gaussianity and asymmetry on metrological tasks, and
offers insights on how to leverage such resources in realistic near-term
quantum enhanced sensors beyond the Gaussian limit.

Motivation: 知识蒸馏（KD）用于压缩大模型为小模型，但传统方法如RKD仅利用经典特征空间的关系结构。QRKD旨在通过量子信息进一步优化这一过程。

Method: 将经典特征映射为量子态，计算量子核值以捕捉更丰富的样本间关系，并用于指导蒸馏过程。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务（如MNIST、CIFAR-10、GPT-2等）上，QRKD均优于传统RKD。

Conclusion: QRKD首次在完全经典部署环境中实现了量子增强的知识蒸馏，且无需量子硬件支持。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
large models into smaller, more efficient student models that can be deployed
on devices with limited computational resources. Among various KD methods,
Relational Knowledge Distillation (RKD) improves student performance by
aligning relational structures in the feature space, such as pairwise distances
and angles. In this work, we propose Quantum Relational Knowledge Distillation
(QRKD), which extends RKD by incorporating quantum relational information.
Specifically, we map classical features into a Hilbert space, interpret them as
quantum states, and compute quantum kernel values to capture richer
inter-sample relationships. These quantum-informed relations are then used to
guide the distillation process. We evaluate QRKD on both vision and language
tasks, including CNNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and GPT-2 on WikiText-2, Penn
Treebank, and IMDB. Across all benchmarks, QRKD consistently improves student
model performance compared to classical RKD. Importantly, both teacher and
student models remain classical and deployable on standard hardware, with
quantum computation required only during training. This work presents the first
demonstration of quantum-enhanced knowledge distillation in a fully classical
deployment setting.

Conclusion: s-序的显式表达式为量子光学中的算符排序提供了新工具，扩展的多项式族为理论发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The s-ordered form of any product of single-mode boson creation and
annihilation operators, containing only a single annihilator, is computed
explicitly. The s-ordering concept originated in quantum optics, and subsumes
normal, symmetric (Weyl), and anti-normal ordering for any two operators
satisfying a canonical commutation relation. Because the s-ordering map can be
viewed as producing a function of a complex variable, its inverse is a
quantization map that takes such "classical" functions to quantum operators.
The explicit s-ordered expressions are derived with the aid of a parametric
family of Sheffer polynomial sequences (or equivalently an exponential Riordan
array of polynomial coefficients), called the Hsu-Shiue family. To yield
orderings interpolating between normal and anti-normal, this family is extended
in an intricate way.

Abstract: Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have
been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However,
realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state
quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak
coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for
hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for
coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we
present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers
(NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a
Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit
interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the
interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy
setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state
dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as
spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing
experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam
exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling
strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free
electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling
under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum
control with electron beams.

Result: 发现了超MIST区域和瞬态读取条件，揭示了强驱动下的非平衡动力学。

Conclusion: 研究结果适用于多种超导量子比特，为测量优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dispersive readout plays a central role in superconducting quantum computing,
enabling quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements of qubits through a coupled
microwave resonator. However, under strong readout drives, multi-photon
resonances can cause measurement-induced state transition (MIST), resulting in
qubit leakage out of the computational subspace and compromising the QND
character. We present a driven-dissipative interpretation of MIST using a
reduced quantum model that captures the dynamics and entanglement structure
underlying the breakdown of QND measurement, a feature inaccessible to previous
semiclassical treatments. A super-MIST regime under strong drive is uncovered,
characterized by steady-state qubit inversion and slow relaxation beyond the
semiclassical Landau-Zener predictions. We further identify a transient readout
condition in which the resonator becomes highly populated while the qubit
remains near its original state. These results are broadly applicable to
superconducting qubits such as fluxonium and transmon, unveil the
nonequilibrium dynamics of MIST, and highlight strongly driven regimes that can
be leveraged for measurement optimization.

Abstract: This paper investigates the thermodynamic properties of an ideal Fermi gas

internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, and heat capacity.
Furthermore, we analyzed how the Dunkl deformation influences the isothermal
compressibility, the average velocity of particles, and the Pauli
paramagnetism.

Our method can be easily integrated into lab settings, where transfer learning

Result: 小整数c下观察到长寿命疤痕动力学和非单调遍历性转变，验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 双频驱动为控制疤痕、预热化和时间晶体行为提供了理论平台。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a continuous two frequency drive is a versatile and
robust protocol to control the lifetime of quantum many body scars and to
engineer non-equilibrium phases of driven quantum matter. By modulating the
frequency ratio $c$ (any rational number), we systematically explore prethermal
features across a broad frequency range. For small integer values of $c$, we
observe ergodicity breaking even at moderately low frequencies, signaling
long-lived scarred dynamics. By continuously increasing $c$, one can generate
non-monotonic transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic dynamics. These
observations are consistent with the predictions of an effective Floquet
Hamiltonian based approach. Furthermore, we exploit this tunability to engineer
fractional subharmonic responses, highlighting the potential of two-frequency
driving as a theoretical platform for controlling scars, prethermalization, and
time crystal-like behavior.

Abstract: We study the scaling behaviors of the Active Model B+ using the functional
renormalization group (FRG) approach, based on the nonequilibrium effective
action formulated via the Martin-Siggia-Rose path-integral formalism. We derive
the $\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$
dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the RG
flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the
parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we
determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the
existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the
perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition
from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue
that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those
obtained in its perturbative counterpart.

Conclusion: 研究确立了SM作为LLg的确定性类比，为超扩散系统的多时间位置相关性预测提供了高效工具。

Abstract: We consider deterministic dynamics, known as the slicer map (SM), which
exhibits normal and anomalous diffusion by varying a single parameter. The
statistics of the position moments and the low-order position autocorrelation
function (PACF) of the SM closely overlap with those of a stochastic process
called the L\'evy-Lorentz gas (LLg), particularly in the normal and strongly
superdiffusive anomalous regimes. However, matching low-order statistics alone
cannot fully characterize the microscopic dynamics or distinguish underlying
process classes. To demonstrate how these dynamics strongly overlap, we focus
on the scaling of higher-order PACF, which provides a more detailed
characterization. In this paper, we analytically derive the generalized PACF of
the SM and explore its scaling forms under different temporal relationships.
Specifically, we derive several scalings of the 3-point PACF by analyzing
intriguing relations between three times. We compare these scalings with the
power-law tails of the numerically estimated 3-point PACF of the LLg. This
comparison provides a detailed description of the correlation scalings of the
SM, demonstrating that the SM shares key features with the LLg. Our findings
establish the SM as a deterministic analog of the LLg, enabling efficient
prediction of multi-time position correlations in superdiffusive systems.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria
across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for
designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional
approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST),
often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability
under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process
modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs)
from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process
optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of
adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enable high-fidelity mixture
adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We

Abstract: An analytically solvable cell fluid model with unrestricted cell occupancy,
infinite-range Curie-Weiss-type attraction and short-range intra-cell repulsion
is studied within the grand-canonical ensemble. Building on an exact
single-integral representation of the grand partition function, we apply
Laplace's method to obtain asymptotically exact expressions for the pressure,
density and equation of state. The model exhibits a hierarchy of first-order
transitions, each terminating at a critical point. We determine the coordinates
of the first five such points. Recasting the formalism in dimensionless
variables highlights the explicit temperature dependence of all thermodynamic
functions. This enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the entropy.
The results reveal pronounced entropy minima around integer cell occupancies
and reproduce density-anomaly isotherm crossings analogous to those in
core-softened models.

Conclusion: 研究结果为经典系统中的能量回收提供了新途径，并表明量子ergotropy问题并无本质上的量子特性。

Abstract: Finding the time dependent perturbation that extracts the maximal amount of
energy (a.k.a. ergotropy) from a thermally isolated quantum system is a
central, solved, problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem
has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g., in the field of
plasma physics, but a general solution is still missing there. By building on
the analogy with the quantum solution, we provide the classical ergotropy
extraction driving: it consists of an instantaneous quench followed by an
adiabatic return. We illustrate how the solution, which is valid under an
ergodic assumption, is instrumental to finding the ergotropy extracting driving
in more general cases. We also show that, just like in the quantum case, the
classical ergotropy splits into a coherent and an incoherent part. The
presented results open new ways for practical energy recovery in the classical
regime while suggesting that there is nothing genuinely quantum in the quantum
ergotropy problem.

Abstract: This thesis develops exact analytical tools to study strongly correlated
stochastic systems, with a focus on extreme value statistics, gap statistics,
and full counting statistics in multi-particle processes. A central
contribution is the universal characterization of conditionally independent
identically distributed variables-random variables that become independent upon
conditioning on latent parameters. This structure arises naturally in systems
with stochastic resetting, a mechanism that generates strong long-range
correlations while retaining analytical tractability.
  Using this framework, we derive universal closed-form expressions for several
observables across diverse models, including Brownian motion, Levy flights,
ballistic particles, and Dyson Brownian motion, under various resetting
protocols. In particular, we demonstrate that resetting induces analytically
tractable non-equilibrium steady states.
  Theoretical predictions are supported by numerical comparisons and
experimental comparisons in systems such as diffusive particles in switching
harmonic traps. Applications to search optimization are also explored,
identifying regimes where resetting enhances or impairs first-passage
efficiency, and proposing rescaling-based protocols that outperform traditional
resetting.

Conclusion: 反馈冷却的信息流和能耗存在基本限制，精确测量是实现高效冷却的关键。

Abstract: We investigate the consequences of information exchange between a system and
a measurement-feedback apparatus that cools the system below the environmental
temperature. A quantitative relationship between entropy pumping and
information acquired about the system is derived, showing that, independent of
the concrete realization of the feedback, the latter exceeds the former by a
positive amount of excess information flow. This excess information flow
satisfies a trade-off relation with the precision of the feedback force, which
places strong constraints on both the information-theoretic cost of feedback
cooling and the required magnitude of the feedback force. From these
constraints, a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of optical
feedback cooling is derived. Finally, the results are demonstrated for feedback
cooling by coherent light scattering. We show that measurement precision is the
major factor determining the attainable temperature. Precise measurements can
also be leveraged to reduce the required feedback force, leading to
significantly more energy-efficient cooling close to the fundamental bound for
realistic parameter values.

Conclusion: 研究为设计高效、精确的微观引擎和自主时钟提供了新思路，揭示了绕过经典TUR约束的途径。

Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) provide fundamental constraints on
the interplay between power fluctuations, entropy production, and efficiency in
overdamped stationary autonomous heat engines. However, their validity in
underdamped regimes remains limited and less explored. Here, we analytically
and numerically study a physically realizable autonomous heat engine composed
of two underdamped continuous degrees of freedom coupled to a two-level system.
We show that this nonlinear setup can robustly violate TUR-based trade-offs by
exploiting resonant coupling, effectively using one underdamped mode as an
internal periodic drive. When this coupling is suppressed, the system recovers
TUR-like bounds consistent with overdamped theory. Importantly, we demonstrate
that the strongest suppression of current fluctuations occurs in a resonance
regime that can be directly inferred from mean current measurements - a
quantity typically much easier to access experimentally than fluctuations. Our
results reveal new pathways to circumvent classical TUR constraints in
underdamped systems and provide practical guidelines for designing efficient,
precise microscopic engines and autonomous clocks.

Conclusion: Mn4Al11是一种新型半半金属候选材料，具有铁磁基态。

Abstract: Half-semimetals, characterized by their spin-polarized electronic states,
hold significant promise for spintronic applications but remain scarce due to
stringent electronic and magnetic criteria. Through a combination of transport
measurements and optical spectroscopy, we investigated the intermetallic
compound Mn4Al11, which features an exceptionally low carrier concentration and
undergoes a magnetic phase transition near 68 K. Transport measurements reveal
anomalies that deviate from typical metallic behavior at low temperatures.
Optical spectroscopy indicates a small, nearly frequency-independent optical
conductivity in the far-infrared region, with spectral weight decreasing as the
temperature drops from 300 K to 50 K. These behaviors suggest a
temperaturedependent carrier density and significant scattering of charge
carriers. Combining experimental findings with calculated electronic band
structures, we propose that Mn4Al11 is a novel half-semimetal candidate
exhibiting a ferrimagnetic ground state.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the influence of off-diagonal dipolar
interactions in the mixed-anisotropy magnet $LiHo_{x}Er_{1-x}F_4$. Motivated by
experimental observations showing an unexpectedly rapid suppression of the
ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_c$ upon substitution of Ho by Er ions,
we use Monte Carlo simulations incorporating off-diagonal dipolar terms to
elucidate the underlying physical mechanism. Our results reveal that, unlike in
the diluted magnet $LiHo_{x}Y_{1-x}F_4$, where dilution weakens the effect of
these interactions, substitution by planar Er ions amplifies it. This leads to
a pronounced reduction of $T_c$, closely matching experimental data, thereby
resolving discrepancies with mean-field predictions. The findings underscore
the essential role of off-diagonal dipolar interactions in determining the
magnetic properties of mixed-anisotropy dipolar systems.

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that $\text{SU}(4)_1$ chiral spin liquid can
emerge in the SU($4$) Hubbard model on triangular lattice. A natural question
then arises: What is the phase upon doping? In this work, we show the
possibility that hole doping can give rise to an anyon superconductor and
propose that both spinons and holons form integer quantum Hall states with
opposite chiralities. Using topological field theory we demonstrate that the
phase is a topological charge-$4e$ superconductor with chiral central charge
$c_-=4$. We further identify the deconfined excitations and anyonic excitations
bound to the vortex. This unusual superconductor may be realized in moir'e
bilayer and detected through quantized thermal Hall effect and spin quantum

Abstract: Itinerant antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal symmetry have recently
attracted attention, since their spin-split bands enable large magnetotransport
responses comparable to ferromagnets despite the negligible spontaneous
magnetisation. When the inversion symmetry is further broken by the
antiferromagnetic order, the emerging odd-parity multipole order renders the
bands spin-degenerate but asymmetric in the momentum space. For such
parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnets, it has been predicted that electronic
nematicity is induced by current, allowing unconventional nonlinear transport
phenomena. However, their experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we
report nonreciprocal angular magnetoresistance in the layered Dirac material
SrMnBi$_2$ with parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic order in its Mn-Bi
layers. By quantitatively modelling the angular and field dependencies using a
phenomenological framework, we reveal that the observed nonreciprocal
interlayer resistivity arises from the broken four-fold symmetry of the Dirac
valleys in the Bi square net adjacent to the Mn-Bi layer. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the alignment of parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic domains
via current-field cooling, achieving electric-magnetic control of the $f$-wave
polarity in momentum space. The observed switchable nonreciprocal transport
associated with current-induced valley symmetry breaking paves the way for
novel antiferromagnetic spintronic and valleytronic applications.

Abstract: Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in
quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing.
In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional
strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and
reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation.
Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases
described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes
fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding
statistics of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of
unconventional braiding statistics, featuring a fractionalization of the first
class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected
Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological
origin in the classification of non-Abelian Berry phases in braiding processes
of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy includes a
reflection operation.. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase
with particle number conservation and particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate
that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a
tri-junction of the SPT phase with the aid of a controlled local defect. In
this example, the zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are
therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our
theoretical predictions. Based on the tri-junction implementation, we
demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and
two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. We further propose
feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the
parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.

Abstract: The nonmagnetic kagome metal ScV6Sn6 displays an unconventional charge order
(CO) accompanied by signatures of an anomalous Hall effect, hidden magnetism,
and multiple lattice instabilities. In this study, we report the observation of
unconventional anomalous thermoelectric properties. Notably, unexpected
anomalous transverse Nernst signals reach a peak value of ~4 {\mu}V/K near the
TCDW ~92 K in ScV6Sn6, and these signals persist in the charge-ordered state as
the temperature decreases to 10 K. Furthermore, both thermopower and thermal
conductivity exhibit significant changes under magnetic fields, even in the
nonmagnetic ground state. These observations strongly suggest the emergence of
time-reversal symmetry breaking in ScV6Sn6, as supported by muon spin
relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements. While hidden magnetism represents the most
plausible origin, alternative mechanisms involving orbital currents and chiral
charge order remain possible.

Abstract: The square cupola antiferromagnet Pb(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$ exhibits the

are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$
symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which
realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify
these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the
$\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding
Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results
unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and

Abstract: The existence of $\eta $-pairing eigenstates in the fermionic Hubbard model
is fundamentally rooted in the $\eta $-pairing symmetry, which may hold for
systems with non-uniform Hubbard interaction $U$. In this work, we present a
generalized Hubbard model containing a variety of pseudo-spin terms that break
the SO$_{4}$ symmetry but retain the $\eta $-pairing symmetry. This allows us
to construct a variety of correlated systems possessing $\eta $% -pairing
eigenstates.\ We exemplify our findings by considering a modified Hubbard model
associated with alternative magnetic fields and on-site repulsion. We find that
the same quasi-$\eta $-pairing eigenstate exhibits two distinct dynamic
behaviors in the two models. Numerical results of the time evolution driven by
several typical Hamiltonians accord with the analytic predictions and provide a
way of the control of an $\eta $-pairing wavepacket with the aid of a
time-dependent Hamiltonian.

Abstract: We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by
the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring
dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge
disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the
disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which
corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the
nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface
separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk
(surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For
both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of
the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the
charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap
between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material,
finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to
the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.

Abstract: Andreev bound states are superpositions of electrons and holes in a metal
that form by coherent reflection from a superconductor. When the length of the
superconductor is comparable to the superconducting coherence length, Andreev
bound states at opposite edges hybridize by quasiparticle tunneling. In a
periodic array, these hybridized bound states form a band at energies below the
superconducting gap. In this paper, we derive a theoretical framework for the
transport properties of these Andreev crystals. We demonstrate that at high
interface transparency and constant phase bias between neighboring
superconductors, these bands are {\it directional}: one band consists only of
right -- while the other only of left-moving electronic states. This property
enables the application of this device as a flux- and bias-voltage tunable
filter that permits signal transmission in only one direction.

Abstract: We report a gate-tunable Josephson diode effect in hybrid nanowire junctions
consisting of a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor core coated with epitaxial
ferromagnetic insulator and superconductor shells. The wires display a
hysteretic superconducting window as a function of axial magnetic field. In the
superconducting regime, the devices exhibit nonreciprocal supercurrent
transport, with the diode efficiency showing a strong dependence on back-gate
voltage. The effect persists in a remanent magnetization state following a
controlled demagnetization procedure, establishing zero-field operation. These
findings demonstrate a voltage-controlled Josephson diode in a single junction
and suggest a route toward probing intrinsically broken inversion and
time-reversal symmetries in hybrid materials.

Abstract: This paper presents a complex band analysis of one-dimensional (1D) square
and high-root topological insulators (HRTIs). We show that edge-state bands of
HRTIs are sliced sections of impurity bands of a uniform tight-binding chain. A
simplified topological characterization of HRTIs with generalized boundary
conditions is carried out based on the existence of edge-state bands in the
infinite HRTI and the restrictions imposed by the boundary conditions. Edge
states in finite or semi-infinite 1D HRTIs are shown to be a subset of
evanescent states of the infinite system and mapped onto impurity states of the
uniform chain with effective energy-dependent edge potentials. The latter
result allows the determination of the edge state levels without needing the
diagonalization of real space or bulk Hamiltonians.

Abstract: We simulate collectively interacting skyrmions in a channel with periodic
asymmetry, and find a strong diode effect for the skyrmion flow. There is also
an asymmetry in the skyrmion annihilation rate for currents applied along the
hard or easy substrate asymmetry direction, with a higher annihilation rate for
hard direction currents. We map out the diode efficiency as a function of
magnetic field and substrate asymmetry angle. We also show that the Magnus
force impacts the diode motion and annihilation rate asymmetry by forcing
skyrmions into corners of the protrusion geometry.

Abstract: Thouless pumping is a paradigmatic example of topologically protected,
directed transport in linear systems. Recent extensions to nonlinear pumps
often overlook the need to reassess the conventional framework of linear
topology. In this work, we study a nonlinear dimer-chain model that exhibits
quantized transport of kinks under a periodic modulation of a pumping
parameter. Crucially, linear excitations in the system map to a Rice-Mele model
and display topological boundary modes localized at these kinks. Using methods
from nonlinear dynamics, we show that instabilities in these boundary modes are
the driving mechanism behind the observed kink motion. While the transport
resembles that of a linear Thouless pump, it cannot be fully captured by
conventional topological indices. Instead, the behavior is more akin to a
topological ratchet: robust, directional, and reproducible, yet fundamentally
nonlinear. Furthermore, by introducing multiple pumping parameters, we
demonstrate fine control over multiple kink trajectories, as well as soliton
motion, suggesting applications in information transport. Our results unify
concepts from linear topology and nonlinear dynamics to establish a framework
for quantized transport in nonlinear media.

Abstract: Exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation at room temperature offers a
promising pathway toward quantum photonic technologies that can operate under
ambient conditions. A key challenge in this field is to engineer a controlled
platform where strong confinement, nonlinear interactions, and structural
disorder coexist, unlocking access to rich collective behavior and
unconventional condensate dynamics. We demonstrate polariton condensation in
CsPbBr$_3$ microplatelets that self-assemble into whispering gallery mode
microresonators featuring tight lateral photon confinement finely balanced with
intrinsic disorder. The system exhibits hallmark signatures of
out-of-equilibrium condensation, including a non-linear increase in emission
intensity, spectral narrowing, and interaction-induced blueshift. Intrinsic
disorder subtly reshapes the cavity energy landscape, inducing condensate
fragmentation and enabling direct optical access to the condensate
wavefunction. Interferometric measurements reveal extended phase coherence,
whereas characteristic fork-shaped fringe dislocations confirm the presence of
quantized vortices pinned by the disordered potential. These topological
excitations underscore the rich physics driven by the interplay of gain, loss,
confinement, and disorder. Our work establishes a scalable platform for
investigating driven-dissipative quantum fluids of light at room temperature,
where the intrinsic disorder balances optical confinement and provides a window
into condensate wavefunction, coherence, and vortex phenomena. This study
system opens new opportunities for exploring many-body physics and potentially
advancing topological photonics in integrable microcavity architectures.

Conclusion: 体光伏效应的量子几何特性揭示了其微观量子起源，对称性约束和拓扑相变对电流行为有显著影响。

Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation
in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar
energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the
change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions,
respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by
mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the
Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and
injection currents, which vanish under circularly polarized light as
constrained by the three-fold rotation and $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry.
Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of
responses is observed in the Haldane model: one direction exhibits a
time-reversal symmetry-allowed response, whereas another manifests a
parity-time symmetry-allowed response. Across the topological phase transition,
the injection current does not change sign, whereas shift current shows a sign
flip. The vector field of the Hermitian connection in the Brillouin zone
possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase.
Furthermore, we calculate the related quantum geometry, including Berry
curvature, quantum metric and Hermitian connection, and demonstrate the
microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE.

Abstract: We discuss the Fermi-velocity renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene due
to Coulomb exchange interaction within an atomistic tight-binding model.
Adopting the Slater-Koster parametrization for the hopping parameters obtained
from first principles, our results only depend on the effective dielectric
constant $\epsilon$ and the Hubbard-interaction $U$. The Fermi velocity of
graphene increases twist-angle independent by $~25\%$ for $\epsilon=10$ and
$U=4eV$, leading to an increase by more than $100\%$ of the flat bandwidth at
twist-angle $\theta=1.4^\circ$. Including also the renormalization of the
out-of-plane hopping terms, we further observe a shift of the magic angle from
$1.02^\circ$ to $0.96^\circ$. Our results offer a microscopic explanation of
the critical temperature, $T_c$, as function of the twist angle where the
largest $T_c$ is found at $\theta_{max}=1.1^\circ$. For $\theta>\theta_{max}$,
$T_c$ is obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the Cooper channel. For
$\theta<\theta_{max}$, the discussion is based on the critical line of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition.

Abstract: The gapless chiral hinge states of three dimensional second-order topological
insulators (SOTIs) support a quantized conductance plateau on thick nanowire.
Here, we numerical study the conductance of SOTI constrictions. According to
finite size effects, the hinge states in narrow region could be hybridized,
which will induce reflection at the two ends of constrictions. The conductance
exists the Fabry-Perot oscillation pattern because of multiple reflections. We
also study the impact of the magnetic field on the Fabry-Perot interference. We
show the dimensional effect that the magnetic field leads to the electrons
being localized on two hinges. Our results are robust against moderate disorder
so that we expect these Fabry-Perot patterns could be observed in experiments.

Abstract: We investigate quantum noise in a mesoscopic quantum dot serving as a
realization of the charged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model weakly coupled to a
fermionic lead via a tunnel contact. We find noise signatures under voltage and
temperature biases that can serve as clear markers of the SYK physics in
experiments with related setups. We develop a linear response theory that
treats all types of noise on the same footing and generalizes a concept of
transport coefficients for charge and heat currents, as well as relations
between them, to equilibrium noise power. Within this theory, we find
characteristic scaling of the noise coefficients with temperature in all
regimes that can be relevant for experimental realizations of the SYK dots,
find a set of universal constants, with their values being unique to the SYK
physics, that connect these coefficients, and characterize noise manifestations
of the Coulomb blockade. Beyond SYK systems, these results may serve as a
general framework for identification of non-Fermi-liquid signatures in
mesoscopic transport and provide additional observables for experiments on
thermoelectric phenomena.

Abstract: Topological phases characterized by non-Abelian charges have garnered
increasing attention recently. Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order
topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of
interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled
energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous
research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian
charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for
two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice
subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states
emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being
trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface
modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably,
the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the
Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of
these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple
degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a
platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium
quantum dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study how a weak perpendicular magnetic field $B$ and a Berry curvature
$\Omega$ modify the magnetic interactions of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal
(WC), using the semi-classical large-$r_s$ expansion. When only a magnetic
field is present, various ring-exchange interactions arise from electron
tunneling along {\it complex} trajectories, which constitute {\it complex
instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in
$B$, each ring-exchange constant acquires an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase equal to
the magnetic flux enclosed by the real tunneling trajectory of the $B=0$
problem. This effect is directly relevant to two-dimensional electron systems
with a small $g$-factor ($g \ll 1$). In the presence of a Berry curvature,
multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a (complexified) phase space
$({\bf r}, {\bf k})$. To leading order in $\Omega$, the exchange constants
acquire the Berry phase enclosed by a {\it purely imaginary} trajectory in a
momentum space. Finally, when both $B$ and $\Omega$ are non-zero, in addition
to having the AB and Berry phase factors, the magnitude of the exchange
constant can also be renormalized by an effective-mass correction. These
effects may be relevant for the WC and its proximate phases recently observed
in tetra- and penta-layer rhombohedral graphene.

Abstract: Quantum spin Hall edge transport in two-dimensional transition-metal
dichalcogenides depends on whether their one-dimensional edge channels are
preserved under realistic substrates and device boundaries. Here we implement
spin-orbit coupling in DFTB and GFN-xTB within the Amsterdam Modeling Suite,
and apply it to 1T$'$/2H WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Edge-projected spectra
reveal robust edge states in 1T$'$ ribbons; and these states remain robust
against a laterally infinite 2H substrate, which only shifts the Dirac point
via long-wavelength corrugation without introducing additional in-gap states.
By contrast, terminated 2H edges generate trivial dispersion branches in the
same energy window that hybridize only weakly with the topological edge modes.
In the bulk, Fermi-level states are 1T$'$-derived; at the small twist angle,
lattice-relaxation-induced strain drives miniband reconstruction, whereas at
the large twist angle, the layers become electronically decoupled. These
findings suggest the conditions -- controlled twist angle and avoidance of
terminated 2H edges -- for achieving quantized conductance and unambiguous
spectroscopic

Conclusion: TAT基FTJ是高性能内存计算解决方案的有力候选。

Abstract: CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted
significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC)
due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face
inherent challenges and hinder their practical applications. Insufficient
current density (JON) and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily
constrained by their dependence on direct tunneling (DT) and Fowler-Nordheim
(FN) tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this
paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT
mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating
ferroelectric (FE) switching, DT, FN tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is
developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact
on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device
structure, the TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high JON and a remarkable on-off
current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight
the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC
applications.

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a novel magnetic phase combining characteristics of both
antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetic ordering. Despite growing theoretical
interest in altermagnetic materials, reports of experimentally verified high
Neel temperature layered compounds are limited or remain to be firmly
established. Here, we present an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) study of Co1/4TaSe2, a compound we
identify as a layered altermagnetic material. Magnetic susceptibility
measurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature
of 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in
excellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of
altermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature
dependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable
band shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel
temperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order. These
findings establish Co1/4TaSe2 as a promising platform for exploring
altermagnetic phenomena.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin structures with non-trivial topology that
comprise two-dimensional quasi-particles and are promising information carriers
for data storage and processing devices. Skyrmion lattices in magnetic thin
films exhibit Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) phase
transitions and have garnered significant interest for studying emergent 2D
phase behavior. In experimental skyrmion lattices, the main factor limiting the
quasi-long-range order in thin films has been the non-flat energy landscape -
often referred to as pinning effects. We demonstrate direct control of the
skyrmion lattice order by effectively tuning the energy landscape employing
magnetic field oscillations. By quantifying lattice order and dynamics, we
explore how domain boundaries form and evolve due to pinning effects in Kerr
microscopy experiments and in Brownian dynamics simulations, offering a pathway
to control and study emergent skyrmion lattice properties and 2D phase
behavior.

Abstract: Topological invariants, rigorously defined only in the thermodynamic limit,
have been generalized to topological indicators applicable to finite-size
disordered systems. However, in many experimentally relevant situations, such
as semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) hybrid nanowires hosting Majorana zero
modes, the interplay between strong disorder and finite-size effects renders
these indicators (e.g., the so-called topological visibility) biased and
ill-defined, significantly limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we propose
the topological invariant rigorously defined for an infinite system constructed
by periodically repeating the original finite disordered system, as a
topological indicator. Using the one-dimensional SM-SC hybrid nanowire as an
example, we show that this general and transparent approach yields faithful
topological indicators free from the biases affecting commonly used finite-size
indicators, capturing the nature (topological or trivial) of the phase at
generic points in parameter space, and providing a reliable tool for
interpreting experimental results.

Abstract: Elastic deformations couple with electronic degrees of freedom in materials
to generate gauge fields that lead to interesting transport properties.
Recently, it has been well studied that strain-induced chiral magnetic fields
in Weyl semimetals lead to interesting magnetotransport induced by the chiral
anomaly (CA). Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a
Weyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present
in a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled
noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge
and thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we
resolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first
demonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit
coupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical
Boltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband
scattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic
field can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect,
whose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the
angle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral
anomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We
further reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an
external magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous
Ettingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional
Lorentz-force-driven counterpart. In light of recent and forthcoming
theoretical and experimental advances in the field of SOC-NCMs, we find our
study to be particularly timely and relevant.
