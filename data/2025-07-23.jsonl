By operator reordering of the underlying many-body\nHamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a\nrecoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the\nresulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity\nmass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We\nidentify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of\nFermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the\nimpurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give\nrise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the\nlimiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition\nis absent."}

In\nthis Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding\nbased on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we\ninvestigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$\nladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we\nfind that the dopant is \\emph{localized} for all investigated \\emph{nonzero}\ntemperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization\nlength controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice,\nwhereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This\ngreatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert\nspace fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant\ndelocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive\nfor weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough\nexchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite\ntemperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative\ndifferences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows\nself-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian\nbehavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient\nfollows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially\ndecreases for decreasing temperatures."}

In\nthis Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding\nbased on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we\ninvestigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$\nladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we\nfind that the dopant is \\emph{localized} for all investigated \\emph{nonzero}\ntemperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization\nlength controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice,\nwhereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This\ngreatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert\nspace fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant\ndelocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive\nfor weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough\nexchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite\ntemperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative\ndifferences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows\nself-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian\nbehavior of regular diffusion.

In the Ising limit, we\nfind that the dopant is \\emph{localized} for all investigated \\emph{nonzero}\ntemperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization\nlength controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice,\nwhereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This\ngreatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert\nspace fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant\ndelocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive\nfor weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough\nexchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite\ntemperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative\ndifferences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows\nself-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian\nbehavior of regular diffusion.

While intermediate\nnon-stabiliserness (i.e., traversal of states outside the Clifford orbit)\nindicates necessary non-classical behaviour for quantum advantage, naively\nequating non-stabiliserness and non-classicality is misguided: Even random Haar\nsampled states exhibit near-maximal non-stabiliserness.

We find a clear mismatch between the two, with\n$\\mathcal{D}_{\\text{dc}}$ exhibiting a strong dependence on the system-bath\ncoupling for the boundary-driven technique, highlighting fundamental\nlimitations of such a method in calculating the transport coefficients related\nto asymptotic dynamical behavior of the system. We trace the origin of this\nmismatch to the incorrect order of limits of time $t \\rightarrow \\infty$ and\nsystem size $L\\rightarrow \\infty$, which we argue to be intrinsic to\nboundary-driven setups. As a practical resolution, we advocate computing only\ntime-dependent transport coefficients within the boundary-driven framework,\nwhich show excellent agreement with those obtained from the Kubo formalism\nbased on closed-system dynamics, up to a timescale set by the system size. This\nleads us to interpret the sensitivity of the dc diffusion constant on the\nsystem-bath coupling strength in an open system as a potential diagnostic for\nfinite-size effects."}

However, the ETH does not specify what happens to\nexpectation values of local observables within an energy window when the\naverage over disorder realizations is taken. As a result, the expectation\nvalues of local observables can be distributed over a relatively wide interval\nand may exhibit nontrivial structure, as shown in [Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{104},\n214201 (2021)] for a quasiperiodic disordered system for site-resolved\nmagnetization. We argue that the non-Gaussian form of this distribution may\n\\textit{falsely} suggest non-ergodicity and a breakdown of ETH. By considering\nvarious types of disorder, we find that the functional forms of the\ndistributions of matrix elements of the site-resolved magnetization operator\nmirror the distribution of the onsite disorder. We argue that this distribution\nis a direct consequence of the local observable having a finite overlap with\nmoments of the Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate how to adjust the energy window\nwhen analyzing expectation values of local observables in disordered quantum\nmany-body systems to correctly assess the system's adherence to ETH, and\nprovide a link between the distribution of expectation values in eigenstates\nand the outcomes of quench experiments."}

This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of\nnovel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\text{N}}$\nsymmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the\nconsequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give\nrise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that\nthis coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit,\nas a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the\nviolation of quantum thermalization in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is\nsuppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily\ntestable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments."}
